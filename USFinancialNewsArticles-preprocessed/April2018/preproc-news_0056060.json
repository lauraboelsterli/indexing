BUSINESS REVIEW\n+ Cypress announced key developments in its Wireless Connectivity solutions during the quarter. The introduction of its ModusToolbox™ software suite empowers developers with an intuitive platform designed to create winning IoT products in record time. The new Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ developers board debuted featuring Cypress’ 802.11ac combo solution to deliver reliable, interoperable and lightning-fast Wi-Fi ® connectivity for developers eager to bring their great Internet of Things (IoT) products to life.\n+ In the automotive space, Cypress introduced Excelon™, a family of high-performance nonvolatile memory products to solve mission-critical data logging problems for applications such as Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS). Cypress also announced that e.solutions GmbH, a joint venture of Audi and Elektrobit, has integrated Cypress’ wireless connectivity solution into its design for new in-vehicle communication units, including in the 2018 Audi A8. The solution is based on Cypress’ Real Simultaneous Dual Band (RSDB) automotive-grade Wi-Fi and Bluetooth ® combo solution, which enables multiple users to connect and stream unique content to their individual devices simultaneously.\n+ Cypress also expanded its sensing solutions with the new PSoC ® 4700S series of microcontrollers (MCUs) that uses inductive sensing to detect inputs on metal surfaces. The devices allow product developers to achieve aesthetic differentiation by using metallic materials in their designs.\n+ Cypress paid a cash dividend of $39.4 million, or $0.11 per share, to holders of record of the Company’s common stock as of the close of business on March 29, 2018 and paid on April 19, 2018. The dividend was equivalent to a 2.6% annualized yield as of March 29, 2018.\nREVENUE SUMMARY (In thousands, except percentages)\n(Unaudited) Three Months Ended April 1, December 31, April 2, Sequential Year-over- 2018 2017 2017 Change year Change Business Unit\nMCD $ 336,710 $ 357,247 317,901 (6 )% 6 % MPD $ 245,531 $ 240,300 213,973 2 % 15 % Total $ 582,241 $ 597,547 531,874 (3 )% 9 % End Market\nIndustrial 18 % 17 % 20 % 2 % (1 )% Automotive 34 % 30 % 33 % 11 % 15 % Consumer 31 % 35 % 34 % (13 )% — % Enterprise 17 % 18 % 13 % (10 )% 37 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % — % — % 1.

SECOND QUARTER 2018 FINANCIAL OUTLOOK\nFor the second quarter of 2018, Cypress estimates financial results as follows:\nGAAP Non-GAAP Revenue $605 million to $630 million Gross Margin % 36.0% to 37.0% 45.5% to 46.5% Diluted EPS $0.01 to $0.04 $0.27 to $0.31 A reconciliation of GAAP forward-looking estimates to non-GAAP forward-looking estimates may be found in the tables at the end of this earnings report.\nThe timing and amount of certain material items, including restructuring charges, asset impairments, changes in value of deferred compensation assets and liabilities, impact of stock-based compensation from modification of equity awards, and the tax impact of non-GAAP adjustments, which are needed to estimate GAAP financial measures are either inherently unpredictable or outside the control of the Company, and may have a significant impact on the Company’s financial results. Accordingly, Cypress cannot provide a full quantitative reconciliation for such non-GAAP financial measures included as part of the second quarter 2018 financial outlook to the most directly comparable GAAP measure without unreasonable effort and additional adjustments may be reflected in our non-GAAP results for the second quarter of 2018. Cypress has qualitatively described below, under the section “Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” the anticipated differences between the non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nCONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST INFORMATION\nCypress will host its quarterly conference call on April 26, 2018 at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time to discuss its first quarter 2018 results and outlook for the second quarter of 2018.\nAll interested parties may dial 517-308-9119 and provide the passcode “Cypress” to listen to the call. The event will be broadcast over the Internet and may be accessed through Cypress’ website at www.cypress.com/investors .

To learn more, go to www.cypress.com .\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nTo supplement its condensed consolidated unaudited financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, Cypress uses the non-GAAP financial measures listed below, which are adjusted from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to exclude certain items, as described in more detail below.\nGross profit; Gross margin; Research and development expenses; Selling, general and administrative expenses; Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\"EBITDA\"); Provision (benefit) for income taxes; Pretax profit margin percent; Operating income (loss); Operating margin; Net income (loss); and Diluted earnings (loss) per share.\nManagement believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional and useful way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations which, when viewed in conjunction with Cypress' GAAP results, provide a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors and trends affecting the Company's business and operations.\nThe Company presents non-GAAP financial measures because management uses these measures to analyze and assess the Company's financial results and to manage the business.\nThere are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures including those discussed below. Moreover, the Company’s non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently than the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures supplement and should be viewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures.\nAs presented in the \"Non-GAAP Results\" tables in this press release, each of the non-GAAP financial measures excludes one or more of the following items:\nAcquisition-related charges: Acquisition-related charges are not factored into management's evaluation of Cypress' long-term performance after the completion of acquisitions. However, a limitation of non-GAAP measures that exclude acquisition-related charges is that these charges may represent payments that reduce the cash available to the Company for other purposes. Acquisition-related expenses primarily include:\nAmortization of purchased intangibles, including purchased technology, patents, customer relationships, trademarks, backlog and non-compete agreements; Amortization of step-up in value of inventory recorded as part of purchase price accounting; and One-time charges associated with the completion of an acquisition including items such as contract termination costs, severance and other acquisition-related restructuring costs; costs incurred in connection with integration activities; and legal and accounting costs.\nShare-based compensation expense: Share-based compensation expense relates primarily to employee stock options, restricted stock units, performance stock units and the employee stock purchase plan. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that is affected by changes in market factors including the price of Cypress’ common shares, which are not within the control of management. In addition, the valuation of share-based compensation is subjective, and the expense recognized by Cypress may be significantly different than the expense recognized by other companies for similar equity awards, which makes it difficult to assess Cypress’ results compared to its competitors. Accordingly, management excludes this item from its internal operating forecasts and models. However, a limitation of non-GAAP measures that exclude share-based compensation expense is that they do not reflect the full costs of compensating employees.\nEBITDA: Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation to the Non-GAAP operating income. EBITDA may be useful to management, investors, and other users of our financial information because it, during a given period, is an indicator of the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, and for certain other activities. However, EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to invest in the growth of the business. In addition, EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to net income, operating income, diluted earnings, or net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nOther adjustments: These items are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they are not related to the core operating activities and ongoing operating performance of Cypress. Excluding these items, which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter, allows management to better compare Cypress’ period-over-period performance. However, limitations of non-GAAP measures that exclude these items include that these adjustments are often subjective and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Other adjustments primarily include:\nRevenue from an intellectual property license, Changes in value of deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities, Investment-related gains or losses, including equity method investments, Restructuring and related costs, Debt issuance costs, including imputed interest related to the equity component of convertible debt, Asset impairments, Tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments, Certain other expenses and benefits, and Diluted weighted average shares non-GAAP adjustment - for purposes of calculating non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, the GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding is adjusted to exclude the benefits related to share-based compensation expense.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nStatements herein that are not historical facts and that refer to Cypress or its subsidiaries’ plans and expectations for the future are made pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We may use words such as “may,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “future,” “continue” or other wording indicating future results or expectations to identify such that include, but are not limited to: statements related to our estimated non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP EPS, net interest expense, tax expense, capital expenditures and depreciation for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 (on a GAAP or non-GAAP basis); sources of revenue for the second quarter; the expected inventory levels, cash flow, pricing and profitability; estimates of certain GAAP to non-GAAP reconciling items for the second quarter; the demand environment for semiconductors; the expected impact of our gross margin improvement plan; the impact of seasonality on revenue; cross-selling opportunities in the automotive business; our ability to meet our targeted range of inventory; the expected or anticipated uses of cash flow, including to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock, or pay down our existing indebtedness; and plans to reduce excess inventory. Such statements reflect our current expectations, which are based on information and data available to our management as of the date of this press release. Our actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to: global economic and market conditions; business conditions and growth trends in the semiconductor market; our ability to compete effectively; the volatility in supply and demand conditions for our products, including but not limited to the impact of seasonality on supply and demand; our ability to develop, introduce and sell new products and technologies; potential problems relating to our manufacturing activities; the impact of acquisitions; our ability to attract and retain key personnel; the unpredictability and expense of legal proceedings; and other risks and uncertainties described in the \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" sections in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
