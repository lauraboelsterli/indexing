    "text": "Robinson Chirinos hit two solo home runs, Jurickson Profar hit a two-run blast, 44-year-old Bartolo Colon pitched seven effective innings and the visiting Texas Rangers defeated the Toronto Blue Jays 7-4 on Saturday afternoon.\nColon (1-0) allowed three runs and six hits and struck out two.\nShin-Soo Choo had three RBIs for the Rangers, who have taken the first two games of the three-game series and have won three in a row overall.\nKevin Pillar hit two solo homers and Lourdes Gurriel Jr. hit one solo shot for the Blue Jays, who have lost four in a row, all at home.\nToronto starter Jaime Garcia (2-2) allowed five runs, five hits, four walks and struck out five in five innings. The left-hander gave up two homers and made three wild pitches.\nGarcia struck out his first four batters before a second-inning walk to Joey Gallo, who scored when Profar hit his first homer of the season with two out. Chirinos followed with his first homer of the game and Texas led 3-0.\nThe Rangers led 5-0 in the fourth on a two-run double by Choo that fell between left fielder Curtis Granderson and center fielder Pillar. Profar walked to start the inning and was forced at second on Ryan Rua’s grounder to the mound. Rua stole second and took third on a wild pitch, and Delino DeShields walked and stole second before Choo’s hit.\nPillar led off the fifth with his first homer of the game, a shot to center, to cut the lead to 5-1.\nChirinos hit his fifth homer of the season in the sixth against Seunghwan Oh.\nTeoscar Hernandez tripled and scored on a groundout to second by Yangervis Solarte in the Toronto sixth.\nGurriel led off the seventh in his first career homer to cut the lead to 6-3.\nTexas left-hander Jake Diekman pitched a perfect eighth with two strikeouts.\nDeShields doubled and Choo had an RBI single in the ninth against Toronto closer Roberto Osuna.\nTexas reliever Kevin Jepsen allowed Pillar’s third homer of the season in the ninth. After Jepsen walked Kendrys Morales with two out, he was replaced by Keone Kela, who earned his sixth save of the season.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
