    "text": "WESTBURY, N.Y., April 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nEarnings : Net income was $106.6 million in the current first quarter, up 2% from the $104.0 million reported for the three 2017. Net income available to common shareholders totaled $98.3 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $104.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Non-interest expenses for the quarter totaled $139.1 million, down $27.8 million or 17% from the year-ago quarter. The efficiency ratio was 47.45% compared to 50.99% in the year-ago quarter. Our return on average assets was 0.87% for the quarter, compared to 0.85% in the first quarter of 2017 and our return on average common stockholders' equity was 6.26% compared to 6.76%. (1) Our return on average tangible assets was 0.92% compared to 0.90% and our return on average tangible common stockholders' equity was 10.21% compared to 11.20%. (1) (2) Net Interest Margin : The net interest margin declined six basis points to 2.42% compared to the fourth quarter 2017 margin. Excluding prepayments, the net interest margin would have been 2.29%, down eight basis points from the fourth quarter 2017 margin. Prepayment income added 13 basis points to the net interest margin this quarter compared to 11 basis points last quarter. Balance Sheet : Total loans held for investment increased $501 million or 5% on an annualized basis to $38.9 billion, with most of the growth being multi-family loans. Total multi-family loans increased $582 million or 8% on an annualized basis. Total deposits increased $133 million or 2% on an annualized basis, with most of the growth in certificates of deposit and non-interest bearing accounts. Asset Quality : Non-performing assets represented $88.8 million or 0.18% of total assets. Non-performing loans represented $73.4 million or 0.19% of total loans. Net charge-offs totaled $6.5 million or 0.02% of average loans. The allowance for loan losses represented 219.6% of non-performing loans.\nCapital Position at March 31, 2018: Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 11.44%. Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio was 12.92%. Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio was 14.41%. Leverage Capital Ratio was 9.49%.\n(1) Return on average assets and on average tangible assets is calculated using net income. Return on average\ncommon stockholders' equity and on average tangible common stockholders' equity is calculated using net\nincome available to common shareholders.\n(2) \"Tangible assets\" and \"tangible common stockholders' equity\" are non-GAAP financial measures. See the\ndiscussion and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures with the comparable GAAP measures on page\n8 of this release.\nNew York Community Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE: NYCB) (the \"Company\") today reported net income of $106.6 million for the three 2018, up 2% from the $104.0 million reported for the three 2017. Net income available to common shareholders was $98.3 million, down 5% compared to $104.0 million in the year-ago first quarter. In the current first quarter period, the Company paid $8.2 million in preferred stock dividends, whereas there was no such payment in the first quarter of last year. Diluted earnings per common share for the three 2018 was $0.20 as compared to $0.21 for the three 2017.\nCommenting on the Company's first quarter performance, President and Chief Executive Officer Joseph R. Ficalora stated, \"In several ways, the Company's first quarter 2018 performance picks up where our fourth quarter 2017 performance left off. Our loan growth continued into the new year, our operating expenses were lower than expected, asset quality was stable, and despite a sharp increase in short-term interest rates, the net interest margin held up relatively well.\n\"Despite beginning of the year seasonality, we originated $2.4 billion of loans held for investment during the quarter and we grew our loan portfolio by $501 million compared to the fourth quarter of last year, or 5% on an annualized basis. Once again, the growth was driven by our core multi-family loan portfolio which increased $582 million or an 8% annualized rate of growth.\n\"Our loan production continues to adhere to our strict underwriting standards. Asset quality during the first quarter remained strong and all of our asset quality metrics were relatively unchanged compared to the fourth quarter.\n\"The net interest margin was 2.42% during the quarter, down six basis points relative to the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the contribution from prepayment income, the margin would have been 2.29% compared to 2.37% in the prior quarter. In addition to the impact from the Fed's 25-basis point rate increases in December 2017 and March 2018, the margin was also impacted by the industry-wide increase in retail deposit costs.\n\"Lastly, non-interest expenses came in at $139.1 million for the quarter. This is down $27.8 million or 17% from the year-ago quarter and down $9.4 million or 6% from the prior quarter. As a result, our efficiency ratio dropped below the 50% level, improving to 47.45% during the quarter.\n\"All things considered, we believe that 2018 is off to a good start, especially as it pertains to loan growth and expenses.\"\nBoard of Directors Declares $0.17 per Common Share Dividend Payable on May 22, 201 8\nReflecting our earnings and our capital position, the Board of Directors yesterday declared a quarterly cash dividend on the Company's common stock of $0.17 per share. The dividend is payable on May 22, 2018 to common shareholders of record as of May 8, 2018, and represents a dividend yield of 5.2% based on yesterday's closing price.\nBALANCE SHEET SUMMARY\nThe Company recorded total assets at March 31, 2018 of $49.7 billion, up 2% on a year-over-year basis and up 4% annualized from the balance at December 31, 2017. Total non-covered loans held for investment increased $1.6 billion or 4% to $38.9 billion compared to the balance at March 31, 2017, and $501 million or 5% annualized compared to the balance at December 31, 2017. The growth during the current first quarter was funded primarily through wholesale borrowings, which increased $430 million sequentially, or 14% annualized. Deposits totaled $29.2 billion, up 2% compared to the year ago quarter-end and 2% annualized compared to the prior quarter-end.\nFor the four quarters ended March 31, 2018, the Company's total consolidated assets averaged $48.9 billion, which was below the current SIFI threshold of $50.0 billion. Given where average total consolidated assets stood at the end of the current first quarter, the Company has the ability to grow the balance sheet by approximately $3 billion without breaching the current SIFI threshold, based on the four quarter trailing average of total assets.\nLoans\nNon-Covered Loans Held for Investment\nNon-covered loans held for investment, net totaled $38.7 billion, representing a $1.6 billion increase or 4% from the year-ago quarter and a $498 million increase or 5% annualized growth compared to the prior quarter. Total non-covered mortgage loans held for investment increased $1.4 billion or 4% from March 31, 2017 and $507 million or 6% annualized from December 31, 2017. Once again, this growth was centered in the multi-family loan portfolio. Total multi-family loans increased $1.6 billion to $28.7 billion or 6% from the year-ago quarter and $582 million or 8% annualized from the prior quarter.\nCommercial real estate (\"CRE\") loans declined $281 million to $7.3 billion or 4% compared to the balance at March 31, 2017. One-to-four family loans totaled $466.0 million as of the current first quarter, compared to $417.0 million in the first quarter of the prior year and $477.2 million compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Acquisition, development, and construction (\"ADC\") loans were $441.6 million for the three 2018, up $59.3 million or 16% compared to the three 2017 and up a modest $5.9 million or 5% annualized, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nOriginations\nTotal loans originated for investment increased 46% on a year-over-year basis to $2.4 billion, but declined 22% from the seasonally strong fourth quarter. The year-over-year growth in originations was driven by our core multi-family loans and to a lesser extent, growth in our specialty finance business.\nPipeline\nThe current pipeline stands at $2.0 billion. This includes $1.3 billion in multi-family loans, $279 million in CRE loans, and $319 million in specialty finance loans.\nFunding Sources\nDeposits\nTotal deposits at March 31, 2018 were $29.2 billion, up $509 million or 2% compared to the balance at March 31, 2017 and up $133 million or 2% annualized compared to the balance at December 31, 2017. The general trend in our deposit composition over the last several quarters has been a shift into certificates of deposit (\"CDs\"). Accordingly, this quarter, CDs increased $1.5 billion to $9.1 billion or 20% compared to the year-ago quarter and rose $419.7 million or 19% annualized compared to the prior quarter. All other categories of deposits declined on both a year-over-year and sequential basis, except for non-interest bearing accounts, which increased $206 million to $2.5 billion or 36% annualized versus the prior quarter, but declined $338 million from the year-ago quarter.\nBorrowed Funds\nBorrowed funds totaled $13.3 billion and were up $430 million or 13% annualized compared to the prior quarter and up $130 million or 1% compared to the year-ago quarter. The majority of the increases were in wholesale borrowings, which rose by the same amounts in both periods.\nStockholders' Equity\nTotal stockholders' equity at the end of the first quarter of 2018 was $6.8 billion, virtually unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2017, and up $133 million or 2% from the first quarter of 2017.\nCommon stockholders' equity to total assets represented 12.64%, 12.81%, and 12.58%, respectively, at March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2017.\nBook value per common share was $12.80 at March 31, 2018, $12.88 at December 31, 2017, and $12.57 at March 31, 2017.\nExcluding goodwill of $2.4 billion, tangible common stockholders' equity equaled $3.8 billion, virtually unchanged from the previous quarter, and up from $3.7 billion in the year-ago quarter. Tangible common stockholders' equity to tangible assets was 8.14%, 8.26%, and 7.99%, respectively, at March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2017.\nTangible book value per common share was $7.83 at March 31, 2018, $7.89 at December 31, 2017, and $7.58 at March 31, 2017.\nAsset Quality\nThe following discussion pertains only to the Company's portfolio of non-covered loans held for investment (excluding purchased credit-impaired, or \"PCI,\" loans) and non-covered repossessed assets.\nTotal non-performing assets declined modestly to $88.8 million or 0.18% of total assets at March 31, 2018 as compared to $90.1 million or 0.18% at December 31, 2017, and increased $18.4 million from $70.4 million or 0.15% of total non-covered assets at March 31, 2017.\nNon-performing loans exhibited the same trends as mentioned above, as total non-accrual mortgage loans increased slightly due to a $6.2 million decline in non-accrual ADC loans offset by a $7.0 million increase in non-accrual CRE loans.\nOther non-accrual loans (consisting primarily of taxi medallion-related loans) declined 4% compared to the previous quarter to $45.9 million, but increased 59% compared to the year-ago quarter.\nNon-covered repossessed assets of $15.5 million were down 6% compared to the prior quarter but rose 51% compared to the year-ago quarter.\nThe Company recorded net charge-offs of $6.5 million or 0.02% of average loans during the first quarter of 2018, which was up 71% compared to the $3.8 million or 0.01% recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017, and up 15% compared to the $5.6 million or 0.01% reported during the first quarter of 2017.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company's total taxi medallion-related exposure was $95.4 million compared to $99.1 million at year-end 2017.\nEARNINGS SUMMARY FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018\nThe Company reported net income of $106.6 million for the three 2018, up 2% from the $104.0 million reported for the three 2017. Net income available to common shareholders was $98.3 million, down 5% compared to $104.0 million in the year-ago first quarter. In the current first quarter period, the Company paid $8.2 million in preferred stock dividends, whereas there was no such payment in the first quarter of last year. Diluted earnings per common share for the three 2018 was $0.20 as compared to $0.21 for the three 2017.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income for the three 2018 of $270.3 million was relatively unchanged compared to the trailing three month period and decreased 8% from the year-ago quarter. Both the sequential and year-over-year comparisons were impacted by higher levels of interest expense driven by a combination of higher deposit and wholesale borrowings balances along with higher rates being paid on those balances. This was offset somewhat by higher interest income during the current first quarter, as we resumed our balance sheet growth strategy.\nNet Interest Margin\nThe net interest margin for the current first quarter declined six basis points sequentially and 29 basis points from the year-ago first quarter. Excluding the 13-basis point contribution to the net interest margin from prepayment income (compared to 11 basis points for both the prior quarter and year-ago quarter), the first quarter net interest margin would have declined eight basis points sequentially and 31 basis points year-over-year to 2.29%.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe Company reported a $9.6 million provision for losses on non-covered loans for the first quarter of 2018 as compared to a $2.9 million provision for the fourth quarter of 2017 and a $1.8 million provision for the first quarter of 2017. The higher provision during the current quarter was related to the higher level of charge-offs during the quarter.\nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $22.9 million, down 10% from the trailing quarter and down 29% from the year-ago quarter. The sequential decline was the result of seasonality in some of our fee business and a net loss on securities compared to a net gain on securities in the previous quarter. The year-over-year decline was impacted by the sale of our mortgage banking operations and covered loans portfolio during the third quarter of 2017.\nNon-Interest Expense\nTotal non-interest expense was $139.1 million during the current first quarter, down $9.4 million or 6% from the prior quarter and down $27.8 million or 17% compared to the year-ago quarter. The primary driver for the lower expenses was a decline in general and administrative (\"G&A\") expense. G&A expense declined $11.1 million or 27% compared to the previous quarter and $15.3 million or 34% compared to the year-ago quarter. The linked-quarter improvement was primarily the result of lower FDIC premium expense and decreases in professional fees. These decreases were partially offset by a $2.2 million increase in compensation and benefits expense due to higher FICA and medical expenses.\nLargely reflecting our lower expenses, the efficiency ratio improved to 47.45% during the first quarter of 2018, as compared to 50.11% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 50.99% in the first quarter of 2017.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Company recorded an effective tax rate of 26.25% during the current first quarter. Accordingly, income tax expense declined 37% to $37.9 million compared to $60.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. The income tax expense in the first quarter of last year reflected an effective tax rate of 36.67%. The income tax expense of $8.4 million recorded in the fourth quarter of last year reflected a one-time net benefit of $42 million as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nAbout New York Community Bancorp, Inc.\nBased in Westbury, NY, New York Community Bancorp, Inc. is a leading producer of multi-family loans on non-luxury, rent-regulated apartment buildings in New York City, and the parent of New York Community Bank and New York Commercial Bank.

Nevertheless, it is management's belief that these non-GAAP measures should be disclosed in our earnings releases and other investor communications for the following reasons:\nTangible stockholders' equity is an important indication of the Company's ability to grow organically and through business combinations, as well as its ability to pay dividends and to engage in various capital management strategies. Returns on average tangible assets and average tangible stockholders' equity are among the profitability measures considered by current and prospective investors, both independent of, and in comparison with, the Company's peers. Tangible book value per share and the ratio of tangible stockholders' equity to tangible assets are among the capital measures considered by current and prospective investors, both independent of, and in comparison with, its peers.\nTangible stockholders' equity, tangible assets, and the related non-GAAP profitability and capital measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for stockholders' equity, total assets, or any other profitability or capital measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which we calculate these non-GAAP measures may differ from that of other companies reporting non-GAAP measures with similar names.\nThe following table presents reconciliations of our common stockholders' equity and tangible common stockholders' equity, our total assets and tangible assets, and the related GAAP and non-GAAP profitability and capital measures at or for the three 2018, December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2017:\nAt or for the\nThree Months Ended\nMar. 31,\nDec. 31,\nMar. 31,\n(dollars in thousands)\n2018\n2017\n2017\nTotal Stockholders' Equity\n$ 6,780,717\n$ 6,795,376\n$ 6,647,351\nLess: Goodwill\n(2,436,131)\n(2,436,131)\n(2,436,131)\nCore deposit intangibles (\"CDI\")\n-\n-\n(54)\nPreferred stock\n(502,840)\n(502,840)\n(503,116)\nTangible common stockholders' equity\n$ 3,841,746\n$ 3,856,405\n$ 3,708,050\nTotal Assets\n$ 49,654,874\n$ 49,124,195\n$ 48,824,564\nLess: Goodwill\n(2,436,131)\n(2,436,131)\n(2,436,131)\nCDI\n-\n-\n(54)\nTangible assets\n$ 47,218,743\n$ 46,688,064\n$ 46,388,379\nAverage Common Stockholders' Equity\n$ 6,287,730\n$ 6,253,482\n$ 6,151,286\nLess: Average goodwill and CDI\n(2,436,131)\n(2,436,131)\n(2,436,286)\nAverage tangible common stockholders' equity\n$ 3,851,599\n$ 3,817,351\n$ 3,715,000\nAverage Assets\n$ 48,862,383\n$ 48,175,046\n$ 48,736,309\nLess: Average goodwill and CDI\n(2,436,131)\n(2,436,131)\n(2,436,286)\nAverage tangible assets\n$ 46,426,252\n$ 45,738,915\n$ 46,300,023\nNet Income Available to Common Shareholders\n$ 98,345\n$ 128,314\n$ 103,957\nAdd back: Amortization of CDI, net of tax\n-\n-\n92\nAdjusted net income available to common shareholders\n$ 98,345\n$ 128,314\n$ 104,049\nGAAP MEASURES:\nReturn on average assets (1)\n0.87\n%\n1.13\n%\n0.85\n%\nReturn on average common stockholders' equity (2)\n6.26\n8.21\n6.76\nBook value per common share\n$12.80\n$12.88\n$12.57\nCommon stockholders' equity to total assets\n12.64\n12.81\n12.58\nNON-GAAP MEASURES:\nReturn on average tangible assets (1)\n0.92\n%\n1.19\n%\n0.90\n%\nReturn on average tangible common stockholders' equity (2)\n10.21\n13.45\n11.20\nTangible book value per common share\n$7.83\n$7.89\n$7.58\nTangible common stockholders' equity to tangible assets\n8.14\n8.26\n7.99\n(1) To calculate return on average assets for a period, we divide net income generated during that period by average assets\nrecorded during that period.

contribution of prepayment income, is recorded in accordance with GAAP, adjusted net interest margin, which excludes the contribution of prepayment income, is not. Nevertheless, management uses this non-GAAP measure in its analysis of our performance, and believes that this non-GAAP measure should be disclosed in our earnings releases and other investor communications for the following reasons:\nAdjusted net interest margin gives investors a better understanding of the effect of prepayment income on our net interest margin. Prepayment income in any given period depends on the volume of loans that refinance or prepay, or securities that prepay, during that period. Such activity is largely dependent on external factors such as current market conditions, including real estate values, and the perceived or actual direction of market interest rates.\nAdjusted net interest margin is among the measures considered by current and prospective investors, both independent of, and in comparison with, our peers.\nNEW YORK COMMUNITY BANCORP, INC.\nSUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL
