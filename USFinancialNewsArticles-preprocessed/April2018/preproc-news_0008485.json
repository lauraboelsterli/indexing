(the “Company,” “Halitron”) (OTC: HAON), a multisector holding company, is pleased to announce approximately $350,000 in revenue in its first quarter 2018 (unaudited).\n- Product Line Expansion. Management continues to develop its manufacturing capabilities by adding a 2-color offset press. Management has also targeted a number of other equipment additions to broaden its manufacturing skillsets and improve margins by vertically integrating the manufacturing process.\n- The Hopp Company Integration. Management will be exiting the New York facility by May 1st, 2018; eight months early from the contracted lease obligation which was originally scheduled for December 31, 2018. The cost savings will help improve cash flows which will be allocated towards the Company’s growth plan including the stock buyback program.\n- No Reverse Split Planned. As previously communicated, Management does not anticipate a reverse split of the stock to achieve the increased share objective but rather is forecasting for increased sales along with future accretive acquisitions whereby the cash flow from operations can be utilized to buy the shares back in the open market.\nAbout Halitron, Inc.\nHalitron, Inc., a multisector holding company, is focused on acquiring sales, marketing, and manufacturing businesses, and then rolling them into an efficient, low-cost operating infrastructure. Management targets operating entities that can either benefit from current operating infrastructure or operate autonomously and offer an additional product or service to scale existing operations.
