REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini/File Photo Enel, one of Europe’s biggest renewable energy players, said it had won the right to sign a 25-year energy supply contract for a 285 megawatt wind power farm in the state of Gujarat.\nThe state-controlled utility said it would be investing more than $290 million to build the plant.\nAntonio Cammisecra, head of Enel’s Green Power division, said the company considered India a strategic country.\n“We are planning to expand further in India which will also serve as a platform for growth throughout the overall Asia Pacific region,” he said.\nReporting by Stephen Jewkes, editing by Giulia Segreti\n ",
