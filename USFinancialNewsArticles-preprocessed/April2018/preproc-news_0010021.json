    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - The CEO of Russia’s Gazprom, Alexei Miller, said on Friday he was proud of having been included on a new U.S. sanctions list and that the company’s policies were right.\nFILE PHOTO: Alexei Miller, chief executive of Russia's top natural gas producer, Gazprom, attends a news conference after an annual general shareholders meeting of the company in Moscow, Russia June 26, 2015. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin/File Photo “Not being included in the first list I even had some doubts - may be something is wrong (with me)? But I am finally included. This means that we are doing everything right,” Miller said through his spokesman.\nThe United States imposed sanctions against Russian businessmen, companies and government officials, striking at associates of President Vladimir Putin in one of Washington’s most aggressive moves to punish Moscow for a range of activities, including alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.\nReporting by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber and Vladimir Soldatkin; Editing by Katya Golubkova and David Evans\n ",
