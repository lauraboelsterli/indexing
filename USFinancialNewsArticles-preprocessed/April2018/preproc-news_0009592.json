    "text": "TORONTO, Itafos (TSX-V:IFOS) announced today that Rafael Rangel will resign as Chief Financial Officer effective immediately to pursue opportunities outside the Company. The Board of Directors has appointed George Burdette to serve as Chief Financial Officer effective upon Mr. Rangel’s departure.\n“We thank Rafael for the contribution he made to Itafos during his tenure,” Brian Zatarain, Chief Executive Officer, said. “With the acquisition of the Conda Phosphate Operations and GB Minerals Limited, Itafos is well-positioned to continue the implementation of its strategy of building a pure-play phosphate fertilizer company. Mr. Burdette is the right person to join our leadership team as we enter this new phase of growth.”\nMr. Burdette comes to Itafos with over 12 years of corporate development, financial, commercial and investment management experience. Mr. Burdette led or supported over $8 billion of acquisitions, divestitures, mergers and financings in the U.S. and in various emerging markets.

Prior to First Solar, Mr. Burdette had a range of experience in private equity and corporate roles at both Zaff Capital and AEI, covering corporate development, financings and enterprise risk management working together with Brent de Jong (Itafos Chairman) and Brian Zatarain (Itafos Chief Executive Officer). Mr. Burdette holds a Bachelor of Arts in International Business and French from Wofford College and an International Master of Business Administration from the University of South Carolina.\nAbout Itafos\nItafos is an integrated producer of phosphate fertilizers with an attractive portfolio of long-term strategic assets.
