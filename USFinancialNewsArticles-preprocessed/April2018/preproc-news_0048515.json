Mr. Thompson will expand Evercore's existing real estate advisory capabilities by establishing a global real estate capital raising platform to complement Evercore's rapidly growing private equity and secondary capital advisory practice for financial sponsors and investors.\nMr. Thompson will join Nigel Dawn as the second Senior Managing Director in Evercore's PCA Group, Marty Cicco who leads Evercore's real estate investment banking advisory practice and Jarrett Vitulli who leads the real estate advisory business within PCA. Combining a new market leading global capital raising platform with Evercore's market leading real estate advisory business uniquely positions Evercore to provide a full suite of fundraising, capital advisory and strategic advisory services to real estate focused sponsors and their limited partners.\nMr. Thompson has over thirty years' experience raising capital for a broad range of real estate funds and ventures. He has served in leadership roles for various firms, including LaSalle Advisors, Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette/Credit Suisse and Greenhill & Co., and he has overseen the formation of over 110 real estate partnerships totaling almost $70 billion of capital globally.\nMr. Thompson will be the co-CEO of Evercore's PCA business alongside current CEO Nigel Dawn, who established the business in 2013.
