But that also threatens a stockpile of unused metal hanging over the market and its price. \nOn April 6, the U.S. sanctioned Oleg Deripaska, who controls Rusal, and other Russian individuals and entities. Following the sanctions, major commodities firms including Glencore PLC GLNCY, +0.24% and Rio Tinto PLC RIO, +0.58% have invoked force majeure, defaulting trading contracts with the miner, while traders elsewhere are scrambling to plug the gap left by the Russian company—which is responsible for 13% of the world’s non-Chinese supply.
