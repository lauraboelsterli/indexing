    "text": "2 COMMENTS A startup called Givewith has a pitch for advertisers looking to appeal to socially conscious consumers and boost their sales at a time when audiences are increasingly dodging marketing pitches.\nGivewith is introducing a new product designed to make it easier for a company to donate to nonprofits as part of its digital ad buys and measure the impact of the company’s charitable giving on its performance. Givewith’s technology automatically triggers a donation to a chosen nonprofit every time someone clicks or views a digital ad.\nThe theory is that associating a brand’s advertisement with a donation to a nonprofit will resonate more with consumers, encouraging them to engage with the ad and creating a positive association that can drive brand loyalty or increased spending.\nGivewith, which is 50% owned by CBS Corp. CBS.A -2.10% , helps advertisers select nonprofit partners that are most likely to boost the advertiser’s results, such as brand sentiment or sales. Givewith handles the media buy and creative execution of the ads, as well as the analysis of the campaign.\nThe company’s algorithm also helps businesses calculate the impact of non-profit partnerships and donations on social governance scores that measure a company’s approach to and impact on social issues, such as climate change, human rights and board diversity. These scores are increasingly important to some investors and consumers.\nThe goal is to show advertisers that an ad spend has the capacity to improve a social governance score and ultimately sales, said Paul Polizzotto, Givewith’s founder and CEO. “My hope is that because advertisers still find that they’re accomplishing so many other business objectives, they’ll actually spend more money on advertising,” he said.\nEarly results suggest that corporate giving is resonating with consumers, said Mr. Polizzotto.\nFor Dell, Givewith created a digital ad promoting the company’s pledge to protect the oceans in partnership with clean water nonprofit, Waterkeeper Alliance. Every time a consumer clicked on the ad, or viewed a video for a certain amount of time, technology embedded in the ad unit directed money to the organization. Consumers were also directed to the campaign landing page, which promoted Dell’s use of ocean plastics in its packaging. The campaign generated an 85% lift in brand favorability and 66% increase in intent to purchase a Dell product, said Mr. Polizzotto. The company recently wrapped up another effort for Dell supporting Girls Who Code.\nThe launch comes as more brands feel the need to incorporate social and often polarizing political causes in their communications efforts in order to resonate with younger consumers. At the same time, advertisers and media companies are struggling to reach increasingly elusive consumers who are growing wary of ads that track them around the web and are more frequently employing ad blockers.\nGivewith, which began building the platform from scratch with digital product agency Work & Co a little under a year ago, expects to generate sales in the “low double-digit millions” in 2018, said Mr. Polizzotto. Clients include Dell, Allstate and Coldwell Banker, among others. The startup is just now coming out of beta and working with a handful of digital publishers, including Essence and the Telegraph.\nMore than 15 years ago, Mr. Polizzotto founded another company, EcoMedia, which helped brands partner with nonprofits and execute campaigns. He ultimately sold it to CBS, which uses it internally.\n“Givewith solidifies CBS’s place in the vanguard of social corporate entrepreneurship,” said Leslie Moonves, chairman and CEO of CBS, in a statement. “Thanks to its technology platform, Givewith allows for a positive social impact to take place with every single transaction between a seller and buyer.”\nWrite to Alexandra Bruell at alexandra.bruell@wsj.com",
