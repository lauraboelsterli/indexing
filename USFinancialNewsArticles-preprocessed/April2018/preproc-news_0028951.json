    "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C., April 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Barings Global Short Duration High Yield Fund (the “Fund”) (NYSE:BGH) announced its monthly dividend for April 2018 of $0.1482 per share, payable on May 1, 2018. Based on the Fund’s March 29, 2018 share price of $18.66 per share, the distribution represents an annualized yield of 9.53% per share. Based on current projections through the payable date, the Fund expects that this distribution will be comprised of net investment income.\nIn addition, the Fund announced estimated monthly distributions of $0.1482 per share for May 2018 and June 2018. The distribution schedule appears below:\nMonth Ex-Date Record Date Payable Date Amount 1 April 04/19/2018 04/20/2018 05/01/2018 $0.1482 May 05/21/2018 05/22/2018 06/01/2018 $0.1482 June 06/20/2018 06/21/2018 07/02/2018 $0.1482 The Fund seeks to pay a distribution at a rate that reflects net investment income actually earned. A portion of each distribution may be treated as paid from sources other than net investment income, including but not limited to short-term capital gain, long-term capital gain or return of capital. The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of these distributions will depend upon the Fund’s investment experience during its fiscal year and will be made after the Fund’s year end. The Fund will send to investors a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will define how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.\nThe Fund is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that is managed by Barings LLC. The Fund invests primarily in short-duration, global high yield bonds with the objective of seeking as high a level of current income as Barings determines is consistent with capital preservation, with a secondary objective of capital appreciation. The Fund expects to maintain a weighted average portfolio duration, including the effects of leverage, of 3 years or less.\nCautionary Notice: Certain statements contained in this press release may be \"forward looking\" statements.
