    "text": "Acquisition adds real-world effectiveness prediction and value assessment to Certara’s model-informed drug development and regulatory science decision-making portfolio\nPRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Certara®, the global leader in model-informed drug development and regulatory science, today announced that it has acquired Analytica Laser, a global research consultancy that uses health economics and outcomes research (HEOR) and real-world data to provide the highest level of scientific evidence of the value of medicines and health technologies. Analytica Laser is headquartered in London, UK, with offices in Europe and North America. It has a staff of about 100 quantitative scientists and consultants, most with advanced degrees.\nAnalytica Laser employs cutting-edge quantitative methodologies and proprietary software to study and predict real-world outcomes for drug value assessment. A pioneer in leveraging evidence-based methodologies to evaluate the real-world value and impact of healthcare products and public health decisions, the company integrates its sophisticated analytics, advanced pharmaco-epidemiology, pharmaco-economics, modeling and data science expertise, public health intelligence, and extensive experience to advise on pricing and market access strategy.\nAdditionally, Analytica Laser has developed a proprietary technology called the Health Outcomes Performance Estimator (HOPE TM ) that translates clinical trial findings and population health knowledge into expected real-world impact. Based on a Bayesian dynamic modeling engine, it allows for consideration of dynamic exposure and the factors driving drug effectiveness and its predictions.\n“Achieving regulatory approval alone no longer determines a drug’s or therapy’s commercial success, or even guarantees its market launch,” said Thomas Kerbusch, PhD, President of Certara Strategic Consulting Services. “Today, each product must be evaluated from a value perspective by payors and health authorities in order to be placed on the formulary, factored into reimbursement rates, and put into treatment plans before it is available for healthcare providers to prescribe. The addition of Analytica Laser will allow us to expand our science and technology decision-support system, factoring in HEOR and the crucial issue of real-world value from as early as Phase 1, through the product life cycle, to health technology assessment and payor decisions.”\n“We are delighted to be joining Certara, a recognized leader in model-informed drug development with an expansive portfolio of quantitative solutions, consultative impact and a broad global reach,” said Roman Casciano, MSc, General Manager of Analytica Laser. “Our complementary approaches will allow us to integrate HEOR and real-world value assessments with pharmacometrics data – delivering safety, efficacy and effectiveness insights – and providing a unique market advantage for our customers.”\nBilly Amzal, PhD, X-Eng, MSc, MPA, Lead of Decision Analytics for Analytica Laser, added, “The combination of Analytica Laser and Certara brings about 250 modeling and analytical scientists together to address the challenges of drug development and market access. Additionally, there are natural synergies between the companies. For example, we can create a seamless transition from model development to model dissemination and communication with BaseCase TM , and provide regulatory advisory and communication support to health authorities and payors with Synchrogenix.”\nEarlier this year, Certara acquired BaseCase Management GmbH, a visualization technology and value communications company that facilitates the creation of visual value propositions to support a drug or device’s ROI and business case. BaseCase’s interactive platform enables pharmaceutical and medical technology companies to visualize both model results and real-world datasets for face-to-face discussions with payors and healthcare providers. The joining of Analytica Laser and BaseCase with Certara creates a unique end-to-end market offering, allowing the company to link analysis and advice on safety and efficacy with product effectiveness and patient outcomes, and communicate complex data effectively.\nMr. Casciano will lead Certara’s new Market Access, HEOR and Real-world Evidence Group in the capacity of Senior Vice President, reporting to Dr. Kerbusch. Dr. Amzal will also continue to serve in a senior management capacity as Senior Vice President, Decision and Real-world Data Analytics.\nAnalytica Laser Founder Lucien Abenhaim, MD, PhD, will join Certara as a scientific advisor. Dr. Abenhaim is a world-renowned pharmaco-epidemiologist and public health expert. He has served as the General Director of Health, Chief Medical Officer, and head of all health organizations for the French Ministry of Health, and as member of the Executive Council of the World Health Organization. He is also an Honorary Professor of Epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.\n“I could not be more pleased that Analytica Laser will be joining the Certara family, continuing serving patient health through the application of insightful science,” said Dr. Abenhaim. “I am amazed by the many synergies between the organizations and foresee a very bright future for the company, its staff and our clients.”\nFinancial details about the transaction were not disclosed.\nAbout Analytica Laser\nAnalytica Laser is a global leader in population health intelligence.
