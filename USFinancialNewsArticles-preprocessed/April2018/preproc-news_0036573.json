This figure, referred to as per pupil current spending (PPCS), varies dramatically by state . Some states spend over $20,000 per student while others spend less than $7,000.\nHere are the five states that spend the most per student:\n[Source: U.S. Census Bureau] New York topped the list, spending $59.21 billion on the state's 2,631,532 students in 2017. The empire state spends $21,206 per elementary and secondary school pupil.\nEven some smaller student populations fare well. The District of Columbia spends $19,396 on each of its 46,155 students.\nNew Jersey spends the fifth most â€” $18,235 per student. For states like New Jersey, spending may be paying off. In New Jersey, 45 percent of adults are college educated, and U.S. News & World Report ranks New Jersey's public education system as the second best in the country.\nLike this story?
