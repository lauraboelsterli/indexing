    "text": "WASHINGTON, April 19 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday that North and South American and European governments agreed to boost cooperation and share information to deny “corrupt” Venezuelan officials and support networks access to the international financial system.\n“Concrete actions are necessary to restrict the ability of corrupt Venezuelan officials and their support networks from abusing the international financial system,” Mnuchin said in a statement issued after the meeting on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings in Washington.\nThe meeting included representatives from Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, France, Germany, Guatemala, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Spain, Britain, and the United States, the Treasury said.
