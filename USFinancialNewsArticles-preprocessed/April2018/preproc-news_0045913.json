REUTERS/David Mercado \nAlong with Argentina and Chile, Bolivia is part of South America’s so-called “lithium triangle,” one of the largest global reservoirs of the key mineral for the production of car batteries. \n“The German company ACI Systems has been selected as the strategic partner,” Juan Carlos Montenegro, head of state-owned company Bolivian Lithium Deposits, or YLB by its Spanish initials, told Patria Nueva radio. \nHe said the joint venture deal will be inked as soon as possible so that operations can begin in about 18 months. \nBolivia has almost a quarter of the world’s lithium resources.
