How much you earn matters, too.\nTo identify the most affordable places across the U.S. , SmartAsset calculated the total cost for five expenses associated with owning a home, including mortgage payments and property taxes over five years, as a proportion of each area's median household income.\nIn terms of affordability, the South came out on top, claiming half of the top 10 spots.\nOf course, price shouldn't be the only factor considered if you're interested in buying a home. You should also consider how your lifestyle will be affected by your location . Ask yourself: How long are you planning to live here?
