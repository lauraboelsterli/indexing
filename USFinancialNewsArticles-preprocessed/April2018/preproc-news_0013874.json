Public schools cost $21,632 for out-of-state students, $9,528 for state residents.\n\"It's heart-stoppingly expensive and it causes so much fear for students and parents,\" Franek said.\nAmericans owe $1.3 trillion in student loans . According to Pew Research Center , the median amount of outstanding student debt for Bachelor's degree graduates is $25,000.\nFranek tells \"On The Money\" that despite tuition \"sticker shock\", \"there's solace to know there's money to be had out there. Certainly from the federal and state government, but also from the schools themselves, based on academics. How well you did in the classroom in high school. And how well you actually performed on the SAT and ACT.\"\nWhile trying to find the college with the best \"fit\" at the best price, do you have any negotiating power?\nFranek says \"yes\", but he cautioned how you should frame the conversations with college admissions officials.\n\"If you're comparing School A to School B\", and you tell one school how much financial assistance the other is offering, he says that's \"probably not the way to go about the process.\"\n\"But if you're a student saying, 'My first choice school is this, and I'm just not getting the dollars that are making that school affordable.' That's a much different conversation between a student, parent and that school. That, I think can be very effective.\"\nOther trends he sees is a tuition reset, when a college reduces the published tuition price. He cited Drew University in New Jersey as an example .\n\"Drew University took $10,000 off the sticker cost bringing it down to what is likely going to be more palatable for the average student and parent coming in.\"\nAnother trend that could reduce college costs, is \"hybrid education, and online education.\"\nBut while acknowledging these trends, he conceded, \"I still think we're going to see costs continue to ratchet up at the majority of schools.\"\nOn the Money airs on CNBC Saturday at 5:30 am ET, or check listings for air times in local markets.",
