Associates began moving in to the Innovation Center in late February, and a grand opening celebration is planned for summer 2018.\nThe 2018 Builder Brand Use Study, presented by Builder Magazine, was conducted online by The Farnsworth Group and included Hanley Wood subscribers classified as “Builders, Builders-Developers, or General Contractors.” The data was collected from 956 qualified responses.
