(NASDAQ:MANH) today reported GAAP diluted earnings per share for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 of $0.33 compared to $0.40 in Q1 2017 on license revenue of $7.6 million, cloud subscriptions revenue of $4.5 million and total revenue of $130.6 million.

Based on our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are maintaining our 2018 full-year guidance,” said Manhattan Associates president and CEO Eddie Capel. “Despite the global geopolitical and economic volatility, we continue to be very bullish on the market opportunity ahead and are investing significant capital into transformative industry leading innovation.

These reclassifications did not affect total revenue, operating income or net income. For further detail, please see note 7 in the supplemental financial information accompanying this press release.\n2018 GUIDANCE\nManhattan Associates reaffirms the following revenue, operating margin and diluted earnings per share guidance for the full year 2018:\nGuidance Range - 2018 Full Year ($'s in millions, except operating margin and EPS) $ Range % Growth Range Total revenue - current guidance $ 546 $ 558 -8 % -6 % Operating Margin: GAAP operating margin – current guidance 20.0 % 20.4 % -11.2 % -10.8 % Equity-based compensation, net of tax 4.0 % 3.9 % Adjusted Operating margin (1) - current guidance 24.0 % 24.3 % -10.5 % -10.2 % Diluted earnings per share (EPS): GAAP EPS - current guidance $ 1.23 $ 1.27 -27 % -24 % Equity-based compensation, net of tax 0.25 0.25 Adjusted EPS (1) - current guidance $ 1.48 $ 1.52 -21 % -19 % (1) Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS are non-GAAP measures which exclude the impact of equity-based compensation and acquisition-related costs, and the related income tax effects of these items. Manhattan Associates currently intends to publish, in each quarterly earnings release, certain expectations with respect to future financial performance. Those statements, including the guidance provided above, are forward looking. Actual results may differ materially. Those statements, including the guidance provided above, do not reflect the potential impact of mergers, acquisitions or other business combinations that may be completed after the date of the release.\nManhattan Associates will make its earnings release and published expectations available on its website ( www.manh.com ). Following publication of this earnings release, any expectations with respect to future financial performance contained in this release, including the guidance above, should be considered historical only, and Manhattan Associates disclaims any obligation to update them.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nThe Company’s conference call regarding its first quarter financial results will be held today, April 24, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. We invite investors to listen to a live webcast of the conference call through the investor relations section of Manhattan Associates' website at www.manh.com .

The phone replay will be available for two weeks after the call, and the internet webcast will be available until Manhattan Associates’ second quarter 2018 earnings release.\nGAAP VERSUS NON-GAAP PRESENTATION\nThe Company provides adjusted operating income, adjusted income tax provision, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted cost of services, and adjusted cost of cloud subscriptions, maintenance and services in this press release as additional information regarding the Company’s historical and projected operating results. These measures are not in accordance with – or alternatives to – GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share measures used by other companies. The Company believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures facilitates investors’ ability to understand and compare the Company’s results and guidance, because the measures provide supplemental information in evaluating the operating results of its business, as distinct from results that include items not indicative of ongoing operating results, and because the Company believes its peers typically publish similar non-GAAP measures. This release should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Form 8-K earnings release filing for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nNon-GAAP adjusted operating income, adjusted income tax provision, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude the impact of equity-based compensation, acquisition-related costs and the amortization of these costs, and a restructuring charge – all net of income tax effects, and the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Adjusted cost of services and adjusted cost of cloud subscriptions, maintenance and services exclude the impact of equity-based compensation. We include reconciliations of the Company’s GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP adjustments in the supplemental information attached to this release.\nABOUT MANHATTAN ASSOCIATES\nManhattan Associates is a technology leader in supply chain and omnichannel commerce.

Equity-based compensation is included in the following GAAP operating expense lines for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Cost of services $ 1,117 $ 1,141 Research and development 921 720 Sales and marketing 558 667 General and administrative 1,747 1,944 Total equity-based compensation $ 4,343 $ 4,472 (b) Adjustments represent the excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies of the stock awards vested during the period. Excess tax benefits (deficiencies) occur when the amount deductible for an award of equity instruments on our tax return is more (less) than the cumulative compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes. As discussed above, we excluded equity-based compensation from adjusted non-GAAP results to be consistent with other companies in the software industry and for the other reasons explained in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed the SEC. Therefore, we also excluded the related tax benefit (expense) generated upon their vesting.\n(c) Adjustments represent purchased intangibles amortization from a prior acquisition. We exclude that amortization from adjusted results to facilitate comparison with our peers, to facilitate comparison of the results of our core operations from period to period and for the other reasons explained in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC.\n(d) In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a provisional net one-time tax of $2.8 million due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) in December 2017. We calculated that amount based on a reasonable estimate of the income tax effects, primarily from a tax on accumulated foreign earnings and the remeasurement of deferred tax assets. We adjusted our provisional estimate by $0.3 million during the first quarter of 2018.\nMANHATTAN ASSOCIATES, INC.

(b) Cost of cloud subscriptions, maintenance and services consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related expenses of employees dedicated to cloud subscriptions; maintenance services; and professional and technical services as well as hosting fees. (c) Adjusted results exclude all equity-based compensation to facilitate comparison with our competitors and peers and for the other reasons explained in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on the date of this release. 8. We adopted the new revenue recognition standard, FASB ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, in the first quarter of 2018. The new standard provides accounting guidance for all revenue arising from contracts with customers and affects substantially all entities. We adopted the standard using the modified retrospective method with the cumulative effect of initially adopting the standard recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2018. We recorded historical hardware sales prior to the adoption of ASC 606 on a gross basis, as we were the principal in the transaction in accordance with ASC 605-45. Under the new standard, we are an agent in the transaction as we do not physically control the hardware we sell. Accordingly, we recognize our hardware revenue net of related cost, which reduces both hardware revenue and cost of sales as compared to our accounting prior to 2018. We recognize and present our hardware revenue net of related cost under the new standard prospectively. For comparison purposes only, had we implemented ASC 606 using the full retrospective method, we would have presented hardware revenue net of expense in our 2017 quarterly financial results below:\n2016 2017 2018 1st Qtr 2nd Qtr 3rd Qtr 4th Qtr Full Year 1st Qtr 2nd Qtr 3rd Qtr 4th Qtr Full Year 1st Qtr Presentation of Hardware Revenue - Pre ASC 606 adoption: Revenue Hardware Revenue $ 8,761 $ 9,554 $ 6,543 $ 9,070 $ 33,928 $ 7,559 $ 10,413 $ 13,540 $ 11,678 $ 43,190 $ 11,224 Cost of Revenue Cost of Hardware (5,629 ) (7,103 ) (4,626 ) (6,068 ) (23,426 ) (5,370 ) (7,766 ) (10,653 ) (8,416 ) (32,205 ) (7,833 ) Hardware Revenue, net $ 3,132 $ 2,451 $ 1,917 $ 3,002 $ 10,502 $ 2,189 $ 2,647 $ 2,887 $ 3,262 $ 10,985 $ 3,391 Proforma Presentation of Hardware Revenue - Post ASC 606 Using Full Retrospective Method: Hardware Revenue $ 3,132 $ 2,451 $ 1,917 $ 3,002 $ 10,502 $ 2,189 $ 2,647 $ 2,887 $ 3,262 $ 10,985 $ 3,391\nContact: Dennis Story Rick Fernandez Chief Financial Officer Senior Manager, Corporate Communications Manhattan Associates, Inc.
