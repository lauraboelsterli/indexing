    "text": "OTTAWA, April 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NAV CANADA today released its financial results for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018.\nThe Company’s fiscal year runs from September 1 to August 31. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company had negative free cash flow (1) of $95 million primarily due to the customer service charge refund, settlements to curtail severance benefits and increased capital spending ending the quarter with cash of $134 million. Financial performance as evidenced by its positive (2) rate stabilization account balance of $135 million which was in line with expected results including the customer service charge revisions implemented September 1, 2017 and reflected a planned reduction of $5 million from August 31, 2017.\nThe Company’s revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $305 million, compared to $296 million over the same period in fiscal 2017, mainly due to a 4.0% growth in air traffic volumes. The second quarter typically has the lowest air traffic volumes of the year due to seasonal nature of air traffic.\n“Even with the seasonal changes in air traffic volumes we saw growth in air traffic in the second quarter,” said Neil Wilson President & CEO. “We were also pleased to have our credit ratings reaffirmed recognizing our continued financial strength and the current strength of our rate stabilization account. This allowed us to complete a successful 30 year bond issue for $275 million at the end of March. We will use the proceeds from this issue to partially retire the general obligation notes which mature on April 19 th . ”\nOperating expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were $340 million as compared to $328 million over the same period in fiscal 2017, mainly due to higher compensation costs.\nNet other income and expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were a net expense of $30 million as compared to a net expense of $15 million over the same period in fiscal 2017, primarily due to fair value adjustments on our investment in Aireon in fiscal 2017.\nThe Company had a net loss (before net movement in regulatory deferral accounts including rate stabilization) of $46 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to a net loss of $52 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nThe Company is subject to legislation that regulates its approach to setting charges. The timing of the recognition of certain revenue and expenses recovered through charges is recorded through movements in regulatory deferral accounts. The net movement in regulatory deferral accounts for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was income of $1 million as compared to income of $18 million over the same period in fiscal 2017. This change in regulatory deferrals of $17 million as compared to the same period in fiscal 2017 is due to higher deferrals of favourable results through rate stabilization adjustments of $4 million and a $13 million net decrease in regulatory deferral adjustments to reflect certain transactions in the periods in which they will be considered for rate setting.\nThe Company’s Financial Statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 can be found at:\nFinancial Statements Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nAbout NAV CANADA\nNAV CANADA is a private, not-for-profit company, established in 1996, providing air traffic control, airport advisory services, weather briefings and aeronautical information services for more than 18 million square kilometres of Canadian domestic and international airspace.\nThe Company is internationally recognized for its safety record, and technology innovation. Air traffic management systems developed by NAV CANADA are used by air navigation service providers in countries worldwide.\nNAV CANADA is a partner of Aireon LLC, an international joint venture deploying a space based Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) system that will expand air traffic surveillance to all regions of the globe.\n(1) Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure used by the Company to enhance the overall understanding of its financial and operating performance. Non-GAAP financial measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. The Company defines free cash flow as cash generated from operations, less capital expenditures and investments in Aireon LLC and equity related investments. Management places importance on this indicator as it assists in measuring the impact of its investment program on the Company’s financial resources.\n(2) A positive balance in the rate stabilization account represents a regulatory credit balance on the Company’s statement of financial position, reflecting amounts returnable to customers through future customer service charges.\nFor further information, please contact:\nMichelle Bishop\nDirector, Government and Public Affairs\n(613) 563-7520\nRon Singer\nNational Manager, Media Relations\n(613) 563-7303\nMedia Information Line: 1-888-562-8226\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to important risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from the results indicated in these statements for a number of reasons. NAV CANADA disclaims any intention to update any forward-looking statements.\nSource: NAV Canada",
