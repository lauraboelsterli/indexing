    "text": "Strategic Positions Created to Support Corporate, International, and Public Sector Growth\nRESTON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Perfect Sense, Inc. , provider of digital content management solutions and services through its platform, Brightspot , today announced it has made three strategic leadership hires to support growth and expansion of its Corporate, International, and Public Sector verticals.\nMelchior Baltazar, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Public Sector and International Business\nBaltazar, who recently served as VP and General Manager for Xator Corporation, will be leading the Public Sector and International business sectors for Perfect Sense. Prior to his time at Xator, he was CEO and Chairman of the Board for SDL Government, Inc. His extensive hands-on leadership experience, technology expertise, business acumen and deep working knowledge of the government and international markets will lay the foundation for Perfect Sense’s expansion in these sectors. A former U.S. Navy SEAL, Staff Judge Advocate General (JAG), corporate attorney, and entrepreneur, Baltazar received his B.A., M.A. and J.D. from the University of Virginia.\nChad Mitchell, Vice President, Corporate Practice\nMitchell will be joining the Perfect Sense team to lead and expand its corporate business with Fortune 1,000 brands. He previously served as Senior Director of Digital Communications at Walmart, where he was integral in building Co.Lab, an internal digital newsroom founded on strategic brand storytelling. Mitchell’s work helped rebrand the company as a “good corporate citizen.” A graduate of the Pennsylvania State University and a native Virginian, Mitchell also created and launched Outside the Box, Walmart’s first branded podcast.\nEduardo Suñol, Vice President, Latin America\nSuñol will lead Perfect Sense’s expansion into Latin America, including business development and customer relationship management with media and brand enterprises looking to build digital newsrooms and increase publishing speeds. Previously, Suñol was Vice President of Digital News for NBC Universal’s Telemundo, where he worked for 8 years. Before that, he was with ABC World News where he produced segments for the newcast and was Executive Producer for the Weekend World News webcast. His new role will be based out of Miami.\n“Each one of these senior leaders is uniquely positioned to expand Brightspot’s market share as we seek to become a global player in the CMS space,” said David Gang, CEO at Perfect Sense. “The increasing demand and popularity for our Brightspot platform has afforded us the ability to engage with this caliber of talent to help drive our continued growth and expansion. The future is truly bright with them on board.”\nThe three leadership roles round out a series of strategic hires including CFO Kami Ragsdale in 2017 and CMO Jenifer Kern in January 2018. Earlier in 2017 the company announced a $22M investment from Carrick Capital Partners.\nAbout Perfect Sense\nFounded in 2008, Perfect Sense is a visionary technology company created to deliver enterprise web publishing solutions and digital consulting services in a more impactful way. Our mission is to empower the art of digital possibility through Brightspot , a content management (CMS) and distribution engine built for high-volume media, brand, and portfolio publishers.\nPerfect Sense serves many marquee brands including Walmart, Johnson & Johnson, Sotheby’s, Univision, U.S. News, Politico, and Scripps Networks Interactive.\nHeadquartered in Reston, VA, Perfect Sense maintains a strong focus on giving back to the community by supporting local and national organizations including Special Olympics, The First Tee, YMCA and Troops First Foundation.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180425005319/en/\nPerfect Sense, Inc.\nJenifer Kern\nChief Marketing Officer\njen@perfectsensedigital.com\nSource: Perfect Sense, Inc.",
