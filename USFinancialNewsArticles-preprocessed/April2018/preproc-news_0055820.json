    "text": "MUMBAI (Reuters) - Thirteen children in India were killed on Thursday when a train hit their school van at an unmanned crossing, the second major accident involving school children in a little over two weeks.\nPeople gather around a school bus after it collided with a train in Uttar Pradesh, India April 26, 2018, in this screen grab taken from video. ANI via REUTERS Police were investigating the cause of the accident in Uttar Pradesh state but authorities said the van driver was responsible for safety at the unmanned crossings.\n“Railways is not responsible in case of unmanned level crossings,” said Ashwani Lohani, chairman of the Indian Railway Board.\nYogi Adityanath, the state’s chief minister, told reporters at the site that the accident was possibly a result of negligence on the part of the van driver, who he said was wearing headphones at the time.\nEight children and the driver were injured and taken to hospital, police said. There were 22 children in the vehicle.\nPeople gather around a school bus after it collided with a train in Uttar Pradesh, India April 26, 2018, in this screen grab taken from video. ANI via REUTERS Railway Minister Piyush Goyal said an inquiry had been ordered and his ministry would pay 200,000 rupees ($3,000) to the families of those killed.\nLohani said that in the long-term, the solution was the replacement of all unmanned crossing in the huge railway network with bridges or tunnels for roads.\n“We are working on it, but it will take time,” he said.\nOn April 9, at least 24 children and three adults were killed when a school bus plunged off a mountain road in the northern state of Himachal Pradesh.\nReporting by Swati Bhat; Additonal reporting by Neha Dasgupta and Malini Menon; Editing by Michael Perry, Robert Birsel\n ",
