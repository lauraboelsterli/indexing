    "text": "Ronny Jackson will not return to his role as President Trump’s personal physician.\nTwo White House officials confirmed the decision to Politico on Sunday.\nJackson withdrew his nomination to head the Department of Veterans Affairs last week, following a series of allegations released by Sen. Jon Tester that accused the Navy rear admiral of overprescribing pills, drinking on the job, and creating a hostile work environment. Jackson has denied the allegations.\nWhile Jackson will return to the White House medical unit, Sean Conley, who had taken over Jackson’s responsibilities as Trump’s physician, will remain in that role.\nTrump has continued to defend Jackson, sharing a series of tweets over the weekend to that effect. The president noted that the Secret Service has not confirmed the charges against Jackson and called for Tester’s resignation.\nAllegations made by Senator Jon Tester against Admiral/Doctor Ron Jackson are proving false. The Secret Service is unable to confirm (in fact they deny) any of the phony Democrat charges which have absolutely devastated the wonderful Jackson family. Tester should resign. The…..\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 28, 2018\n….great people of Montana will not stand for this kind of slander when talking of a great human being. Admiral Jackson is the kind of man that those in Montana would most respect and admire, and now, for no reason whatsoever, his reputation has been shattered. Not fair, Tester!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 28, 2018\nAt a rally in Michigan on Saturday night, Trump continued the attack against Tester, suggesting that the Senator was “throwing out things that he’s heard.”\n“Well, I know things about Tester that I could say, too. And if I said them, he’d never be elected again,” Trump continued.\nTester is expected to face a tough re-election bid in November. Trump won his state of Montana handily in 2016.\nFor his part, the Senator acknowledged to MSNBC that not all of the allegations against Jackson had been verified. Nevertheless, he argued that they warranted investigation.",
