    "text": "Industry Veteran Further Augments World Class Executive Team\nWASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Harbour Energy, Ltd. (“Harbour’’) today announced that David D. Powell has joined the organization as Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Powell is a seasoned oil and gas executive with global operating experience, who has built and managed finance, IT, and supply chain organizations worldwide, led post-acquisition integration activities, and has expertise in both operational transformation as well as long-term business strategy. He will be based in Harbour Energy’s Houston offices, and will have a global span of responsibilities in his new role.\nLinda Z. Cook, the Chief Executive Officer of Harbour Energy, said, “Having closed our major transaction in the North Sea late last year followed by the recent announcement regarding progress with the potential acquisition of Santos Ltd, these are exciting times for Harbour Energy. Given David’s many years of experience as an international oil & gas CFO, he will undoubtedly contribute immensely to the continued execution of our strategy. We welcome him to the team.”\nDavid D. Powell said, “I look forward to working with Linda and the others in Harbour Energy and throughout EIG, and to playing a role in the continued development of this new, global independent oil & gas company.”\nMr. Powell’s previous roles include CFO for Cobalt International Energy and CFO of the petroleum unit of BHP Billiton. Prior to joining BHP, he spent over 28 years in various roles at Occidental Oil & Gas Corporation, based throughout the US, Qatar, Malaysia, Russia and Argentina. He graduated Summa Cum Laude from William Jewell College, completed an advanced management program at Harvard Business School, and has a Certified Public Accountant certificate.\nAbout Harbour Energy\nHarbour is a global oil & gas company founded by EIG Global Energy Partners (“EIG”).

EIG specializes in private investments in energy and energy-related infrastructure.
