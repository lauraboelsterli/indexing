    "text": "A shooting at YouTube’s headquarters in San Bruno, Calif. on Tuesday left four people wounded and a female suspect dead from what appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said.\nSan Bruno Police Chief Ed Barberini told reporters that four people are receiving medical treatment for gunshot-related injuries and that he does not believe that those injuries are life threatening. He did not provide any further details about the suspect.\nHe stressed that the officers are still conducting an “active investigation” and would reveal more details later. He disclosed no motive for the shooting, however the Daily Beast , citing a unnamed federal law enforcement source, reported that the suspect shot her boyfriend.\nAt 12:46 pm PST, Barberini said that San Bruno police officers “received numerous 911 calls” regarding gunshots at YouTube’s headquarters. Police officers arrived on the scene minutes later as YouTube employees fled the building.\nUpon entry, police found a wounded individual. Several minutes later, they located the likely suspect, who had what resembled a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Two more shooting victims were discovered several minutes later. The San Bruno Police Department said later in a press release that “a total of four people were transported to local hospitals, three of which had gunshot wounds.”\nThe wounded have been sent to San Francisco General Hospital, according to news reports. The hospital’s spokesperson Brent Andrew, told the Associated Press that it received three patients. “A 36-year-old man is in critical condition, a 32-year-old woman is in serious condition and a 27-year-old woman is in fair condition,” the news service reported.\nThe San Bruno Police Department had posted a tweet this afternoon at 1:01 pm PST warning residents to avoid the area around YouTube’s headquarters.\nPolice activity at 901 Cherry Ave, please stay out of the area. pic.twitter.com/H6iAj0g7ra\n— San Bruno Police (@SanBrunoPolice) April 3, 2018\nPolice then confirmed that they were “responding to an active shooter.”\nWe are responding to an active shooter. Please stay away from Cherry Ave & Bay Hill Drive.\n— San Bruno Police (@SanBrunoPolice) April 3, 2018\nSeveral YouTube employees tweeted about the incident as it happened.\nActive shooter at YouTube HQ. Heard shots and saw people running while at my desk. Now barricaded inside a room with coworkers.\n— Vadim Lavrusik (@Lavrusik) April 3, 2018\nI looked down and saw blood drips on the floor and stairs. Peaked around for threats and then we headed downstairs and out the front.\n— Todd Sherman (@tdd) April 3, 2018\nWe are seeing @YouTube employees being brought out with hands up! pic.twitter.com/ZlSMY9FIVm\n— Erin (@erinjeanc) April 3, 2018\nGoogle said on Twitter:\nRe: YouTube situation, we are coordinating with authorities and will provide official information here from Google and YouTube as it becomes available.\n— Google Communications (@Google_Comms) April 3, 2018\nMultiple law enforcement agencies responded to the shooting including neighboring police. The San Francisco ATF division said on Twitter also said that it was responding.\nThe ATF San Francisco Field Division is responding to a reported shooting at YouTube headquarters in San Bruno, Calif. pic.twitter.com/l7XabZ5FpI\n— ATF HQ (@ATFHQ) April 3, 2018\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai told employees in a public note that “the situation is contained.”\n“It’s with great sadness that I tell you–based on the latest information–four people were injured in this horrific act of violence,” Pichai said. “We’re doing everything we can to support them and their families at this time.”\nHere is the note that @sundarpichai just sent to Googlers worldwide. pic.twitter.com/bdC6KeTl9c\n— Google Communications (@Google_Comms) April 3, 2018\nThere are no words to describe the tragedy that occurred today. @SusanWojcicki & I are focused on supporting our employees & the @YouTube community through this difficult time together. Thank you to the police & first responders for their efforts, and to all for msgs of support.\n— Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) April 3, 2018\nThe City Manager for San Bruno said in a statement that “several SWAT teams are conducting a room by room search of the entire building,” and that the “initial investigation will continue at least through the evening.”\n“Mayor Rico E. Medina and the entire City of San Bruno organization extend their support to YouTube in this difficult time and best wishes for recovery from this horrible trauma,” the City Manager said.",
