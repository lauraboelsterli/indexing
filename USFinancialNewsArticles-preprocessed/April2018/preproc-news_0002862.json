India middle-order batsman Ajinkya Rahane will captain the side. \nKlaasen, 26, has played four one-day and three Twenty20 Internationals for South Africa, all against the visiting Indian side last month. \nWarner, who quit as Sunrisers Hyderabad captain following the scandal in South Africa, has been replaced by England opener Alex Hales in the IPL side.
