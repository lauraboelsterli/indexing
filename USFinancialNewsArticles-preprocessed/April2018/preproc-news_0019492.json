We look at some notable clashes between the sides. Soccer Football - Premier League - Stoke City vs West Ham United - bet365 Stadium, Stoke-On-Trent, Britain - December 16, 2017 West Ham United's Marko Arnautovic celebrates scoring their second goal Action Images via Reuters/Lee Smith \nStoke City 3 West Ham United 2 (League Cup, Jan. 1972) \nStoke City won 3-2 in the pouring rain at Old Trafford in the final act of a marathon seven-hour League Cup semi-final that was eventually settled at the fourth time of asking. \nStoke had lost the first leg 1-2 before prevailing 1-0 after extra time in the second to force a replay that ended goalless after extra time at Hillsborough. The second replay was played 49 days after the two sides first met. \nEngland’s World Cup winning captain Bobby Moore, temporarily filling in as goalkeeper for the injured Bobby Ferguson, saved Mike Bernard’s penalty before it was tucked in by the Stoke midfielder on the rebound. \nBilly Bonds scored with a deflection before Trevor Brooking volleyed home to put West Ham 2-1 ahead. However, Peter Dobing swept in George Eastham’s pass to restore parity. \nStoke’s Terry Conroy stepped up to score four minutes after the break to secure a memorable victory. Stoke went on to beat Chelsea 2-1 in the final. \nStoke City 2 West Ham United 2 (Premier League, Nov. 2014) \nWinger Stewart Downing scored a goal and provided an assist for another as West Ham clawed back a two-goal deficit to secure a thrilling away draw. \nMidfielder Victor Moses put the hosts ahead on 33 minutes, turning in a loose ball from close range before striker Mame Biram Diouf headed in the second after the break. \nWest Ham pulled one back through forward Enner Valencia, who nodded in Downing’s teasing ball from the right. Downing smashed the ball in with his right foot in the 73rd minute to deny Stoke a win on manager Mark Hughes’ 51st birthday. \nStoke ended the season in ninth while West Ham were 12th. \nStoke City 2 West Ham United 1 (FA Cup, March 2011) \nStoke reached the FA Cup semi-finals for the first time in 39 years as defender Danny Higginbotham’s free kick sealed a 2-1 victory in a controversial sixth-round encounter. \nDefender Robert Huth gave Stoke the lead after 12 minutes, heading in midfielder Rory Delap’s long throw. \nWest Ham’s Frederic Piquionne equalised on 30 minutes leaving Stoke furious with referee Mike Jones who missed an apparent handball by the French forward before he chipped goalkeeper Thomas Sorensen. \nJones then angered West Ham’s players by awarding Stoke a disputed penalty which midfielder Matthew Etherington missed. However, Stoke were not to be denied as Higginbotham drilled in the winner after the hour mark. \nStoke went on to reach the final where they were beaten 1-0 by Manchester City. \nWest Ham United 3 Stoke City 1 (League Cup, Oct. 2010) \nExtra-time goals from defender Manuel da Costa and striker Victor Obinna helped West Ham beat Stoke 3-1 at Upton Park and book their place in the fifth round of the English League Cup. \nStriker Kenwyne Jones headed in winger Jermaine Pennant’s corner in the sixth minute to give Stoke the lead. Midfielder Scott Parker equalised in the 84th with a powerful header from winger Pablo Barrera’s cross. \nDa Costa swept the ball home from close range in the 96th minute after a fine run from midfielder Mark Noble before Obinna eased the home side’s nerves with a neat strike on 118 minutes. \nWest Ham beat Manchester United 4-0 in the next round before losing to eventual champions Birmingham City over two legs of the semi-final. \nStoke City 0 West Ham United 3 (Premier League, Dec. 2017) \nWest Ham moved clear of the Premier League relegation zone after winning 3-0 at struggling Stoke City with forward Marko Arnautovic scoring against his former club. \nDavid Moyes’ side took the lead through midfielder Mark Noble’s penalty in the 19th minute and Arnautovic, who joined the London club in the close season, added a second in the 76th minute having twice gone close. \nStriker Diafra Sakho added a third following a fine pass by midfielder Manuel Lanzini to add gloss to the scoreline. \nThe win was West Ham’s first at Stoke since March 2013.
