The logo of Air France-KLM is seen during the company's 2014 First-Half results presentation in Paris July 25, 2014. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier \nAir France KLM shares were down 1.4 percent in early trading, among the worst performers on Paris' SBF-120 index .SBF120 . \nAir France predicted that 25 percent of its flights would be canceled on Monday, the 10th day of a strike by staff.
