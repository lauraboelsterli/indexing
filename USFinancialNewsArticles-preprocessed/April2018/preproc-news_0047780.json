    "text": "Revenues of $984.7 million Driven by Robust 8.8% Organic Growth Reported Earnings from Continuing Operations of $0.92 per Share\nSCOTTSDALE, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Carlisle Companies Incorporated (NYSE:CSL) reported record revenues of $984.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, a 27.2% increase from $774.0 million for the first quarter of 2017. Organic revenues grew 8.8%, acquired revenues contributed a total of 15.5% in the quarter, foreign exchange had a positive impact of 1.5%, and adoption of the new FASB revenue recognition standard had a positive impact of 1.4%.\nDiluted EPS from continuing operations improved primarily due to higher sales volume of +$0.11, savings from the Carlisle Operating System (COS) of +$0.12, and a lower effective tax rate due to U.S. tax reform of +$0.10. Partially offsetting this performance was raw material and freight cost inflation of -$0.15 primarily at Carlisle Construction Materials (CCM) and higher interest expense of -$0.08.\nThree Months Ended March 31, (in millions, except per share amounts) 2018 2017 Revenues $ 984.7 $ 774.0 Operating income $ 94.7 $ 89.5 Income from continuing operations, net of tax $ 57.9 $ 57.9 Diluted EPS from continuing operations $ 0.92 $ 0.88 Items affecting comparability (1) $ 0.05 $ 0.08 (1)\nSee schedule of Items Affecting Comparability in the financial exhibits All financial and percentage comparisons in the Company's first quarter of 2018 reporting are made to the same quarter of the previous year, unless otherwise stated.\nComment\nD. Christian “Chris” Koch, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, \"We are pleased with Carlisle's solid first quarter results in light of the challenging raw material environment. Carlisle experienced strong organic growth resulting in record first quarter revenues. Our Operating Income performance was driven by savings from the restructuring and facility rationalization actions taken across our business in 2017, and continued operational improvements and cost savings from the Carlisle Operating System. This performance was offset by rising freight and raw material costs at CCM.\nFor the past year, Carlisle has expended significant effort and capital to integrate our acquisitions, optimize our global footprint, and drive efficiencies in our businesses. In the first quarter, we saw significant positive signs that those investments are paying off: Accella remains on track for stated synergies, Carlisle Fluid Technologies (CFT) is seeing the benefits of plant closures, Carlisle Interconnect Technologies (CIT) continues to see strong SatCom and Aerospace revenue and income growth, and Carlisle Brake & Friction (CBF) is showing improved leverage as we emerge from the downturn in their end markets. Additionally, and equally important, we experienced slight but meaningful positive price realization in our CCM core markets.\nAfter closing out our 100th anniversary in 2017, the first quarter saw us launch Vision 2025, the cornerstone of our next one hundred years. In Vision 2025, we seek to drive above-market organic growth, build scale in our core businesses by pursuing synergistic acquisitions, further leverage our COS culture to drive efficiencies through all business processes, continue to return cash to shareholders, and invest in attracting, developing, and retaining exceptional talent in order to achieve $8 billion of revenue, 20% operating income, and 15% ROIC. In the first quarter of 2018, we took the first steps in achieving this vision by: delivering organic growth of 8.8%, paying $23.1 million in dividends, repurchasing approximately $129 million of Carlisle shares, increasing R&D spend by 16%, and optimizing our portfolio by completing the divestiture of Carlisle FoodService Products for $750 million. As 2018 continues, we are well-positioned to take advantage of strong global markets and improving fundamentals in our businesses.\"\nCarlisle Construction Materials (CCM) achieved record first quarter revenues despite harsh winter conditions in much of the United States. Accella's revenue performance met our expectations and integration activities are on track. CCM's year-over-year operating income decline was due to approximately $11 million of increased raw material and freight costs, in line with our stated expectations for the quarter.\n(in millions) Three Months Ended March 31, Acquisition\nEffect\nPrice /\nVolume\nEffect\nExchange\nRate Effect\n2018 2017 Change $ Change % Revenues $ 598.6 $ 446.1 $ 152.5 34.2% 26.9% 6.3% 1.0% Operating income $ 75.8 $ 80.7 $ (4.9) (6.1)% Operating margin percentage 12.7 % 18.1 % Items affecting comparability $ (1.8 ) $ 0.6 We now expect CCM revenues to grow in the low twenty percent range in 2018, including contributions from acquisitions, with organic revenue growth in the mid-single digits.\nCarlisle Interconnect Technologies (CIT) revenues in the first quarter of 2018 demonstrated solid recovery from 2017 challenges, driven largely by the SatCom and Aerospace markets, and an increase of $11 million due to Carlisle's adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. The SatCom ramp continues on track, delivering revenues of approximately $20 million in the quarter. Operating income improved year-over-year driven by higher volumes, COS initiatives, and lower restructuring spend.\n(in millions) Three Months Ended March 31, Acquisition\nEffect\nPrice /\nVolume\nEffect\nExchange\nRate Effect\n2018 2017 Change $ Change % Revenues $ 224.3 $ 194.2 $ 30.1 15.5% —% 15.3% 0.2% Operating income $ 27.2 $ 21.5 $ 5.7 26.5% Operating margin percentage 12.1 % 11.1 % Items affecting comparability $ 2.6 $ 4.3 We now expect CIT revenues to exceed ten percent growth in 2018.\nCarlisle Fluid Technologies (CFT) revenues in the first quarter of 2018, excluding FX, were flat. Strong growth in Transportation and General Industrial markets was offset by the decision to exit low margin revenue related to our factory consolidations. Solid operating income improvement was achieved by price realization and savings from COS.\n(in millions) Three Months Ended March 31, Acquisition\nEffect\nPrice /\nVolume\nEffect\nExchange\nRate Effect\n2018 2017 Change $ Change % Revenues $ 63.5 $ 60.5 $ 3.0 5.0% —% (0.1)% 5.1% Operating income $ 5.7 $ 4.9 $ 0.8 16.3% Operating margin percentage 9.0 % 8.1 % Items affecting comparability $ 0.5 $ 0.5 We continue to expect CFT revenues to grow mid-single digits in 2018.\nCarlisle Brake & Friction (CBF) achieved strong organic revenue growth in the first quarter of 2018, the fifth consecutive quarter of sequential growth, reflecting a continued recovery in off-highway vehicle markets, especially key end markets of Construction, Agriculture, and Mining. CBF delivered strong operating income growth, driven largely by volume, partially offset by costs associated with an ongoing facility rationalization.\n(in millions) Three Months Ended March 31, Acquisition\nEffect\nPrice /\nVolume\nEffect\nExchange\nRate Effect\n2018 2017 Change $ Change % Revenues $ 98.3 $ 73.2 $ 25.1 34.3% —% 28.5% 5.8% Operating income $ 4.5 $ 1.2 $ 3.3 275.0% Operating margin percentage 4.6 % 1.6 % Items affecting comparability $ 2.0 $ 0.3 We now expect CBF revenues to grow in the mid-teens in 2018.\nKoch concluded by stating, “We are excited to enter our second century of operations with a clear road map for sustained success, Vision 2025. Our experienced and talented teams in place across our portfolio of businesses embody the drive, energy, and enthusiasm required to deliver this plan's expected outcomes for our shareholders. Carlisle's performance in the first quarter of 2018 demonstrates that Vision 2025 is well underway.\nFor 2018, we now expect total company revenue growth including acquisitions to be in the mid-to-high teens. We continue to expect corporate expense of approximately $70 million, a full year tax rate in the 25-27% range, and net interest expense to be in the $60 to 70 million range. In addition, we expect our share repurchase program to exceed $250 million in 2018. We remain well-positioned with our liquidity and strong balance sheet to continue to pursue growth opportunities both organically and through acquisitions, while returning value to shareholders.”\nCash Flow\nCash flow provided from operations of $33.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was $1.3 million higher than cash provided of $31.9 million for the prior year period.\nFree cash flow (defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, and comprised of continuing and discontinued operations) was $(9.3) million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, a decrease of $10.8 million versus the prior year. The decrease in free cash flow was due to higher capital expenditures versus the prior year in support of organic sales growth. For the full year, excluding the effect of the sale of FoodService Products, we expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 100%.\nAs of March 31, 2018, we had $979.1 million cash on hand and $1.0 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility.\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe Company will discuss the first quarter of 2018 results on a conference call at 5:00 p.m. ET today.
