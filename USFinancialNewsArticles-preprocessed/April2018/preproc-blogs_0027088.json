Photo: Agence France-Presse/Getty Images \nEvery week, CIO Journal offers a glimpse into the mind of the CEO, whose view of technology is shaped by stories in management journals, general interest magazines and, of course, in-flight publications. \nNew disruptions. In predicting technology’s impact on jobs in the decades to come, Barclays plc looks backwards. “As new technologies make existing ones obsolete, they typically drive new job creation in related sectors,” they write in a new report. Take the modern automobile. It killed the horse-and-buggy industry, but new businesses—and new jobs—arose to meet new consumer demands. Few make bridle reins. Those scented trees sold for car interiors? Today they are part of a half a billion dollar industry in the U.S. For the short term, it is the smaller, incremental advances, what Barclays calls “soft automation,” that deserve attention. History shows that the first few decades of disruption often bring depressed wages, as “most path-breaking technologies end up automating specific tasks within a job, not the job itself.” This “soft automation” hit the textile industry in 19th century England and now it is hitting the taxi and truck industries in the form of cruise control, rear-view cameras and mobile GPS\nVirtual reality’s first heyday was in the steampunk era. Technology enabled museum-goers in Victorian-era England to experience Michelangelo’s David, while the statue itself sat 1,000 miles away in Florence, and walk around–even touch– Mayan hieroglyphs, even as those carvings lay somewhere in Guatemala’s steamy jungles. Starting in the late 1860s, cultural London was a hub for what the Economist’s Tom Standage calls the “Victorian equivalent of virtual reality” — and what everyone else calls making plaster copies of famous sculptures. Mr. Standage finds similarities. Like today’s virtual reality, plaster-casting was on-trend until suddenly it wasn’t. The reproductions also offered people a simulacrum of the real thing. Today, as pollution disfigures original artifacts, scientists are tapping their inner steampunk, applying 21st century digital 3d-scanning technology to 19th century Victorian casts so artifacts “can now be scrutinized online and in modern-day virtual reality.”\nBeyond control? In the end, members of Congress, blackbelts all in the artful dodge, may have found themselves stumped by the torrent of bromides. “It’s not enough to connect people,” Facebook Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg this week in opening statements on Capitol Hill. “We have to make sure those connections are positive.” The FT’s John Gapper writes that Facebook is too large to do more than hope for spreading positive vibes. The company can plug away, but “other things cannot be fixed because they are beyond Mr Zuckerberg’s control, lost in myriad encounters among Facebook’s 2bn users. The technical term is emergence, the powerful and unpredictable outcome of millions of users interacting freely with others.”\nShare this: AUTOMATION FACEBOOK VIRTUAL REALITY Previous Human + Machine: The Impact of AI on Business Transformation",
