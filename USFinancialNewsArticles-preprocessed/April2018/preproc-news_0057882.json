The chart below depicts the net revenue on a consolidating basis for the three months ended March 31.\nThree Months Ended March 31 Revenue 2018 2017 Domestic $ 32,633 $ 27,419 Mueller BV $ 13,608 $ 10,253 Eliminations $ (163 ) $ (61 ) Net Revenue $ 46,078 $ 37,611 The chart below depicts the net revenue on a consolidating basis for the twelve months ended March 31.\nTwelve Months Ended March 31 Revenue 2018 2017 Domestic $ 125,521 $ 111,591 Mueller BV $ 51,516 $ 53,786 Eliminations $ (613 ) $ (906 ) Net Revenue $ 176,424 $ 164,471 The chart below depicts the net income on a consolidating basis for the three months ended March 31.\nThree Months Ended March 31 Net Income 2018 2017 Domestic $ 854 $ 528 Mueller BV $ (497 ) $ (727 ) Eliminations $ 25 $ 56 Net Income $ 382 $ (143 ) The chart below depicts the net income on a consolidating basis for the twelve months ended March 31.\nTwelve Months Ended March 31 Net Income 2018 2017 Domestic $ 184 $ (4,076 ) Mueller BV $ (2,121 ) $ 598 Eliminations $ 136 $ 143 Net Income $ (1,801 ) $ (3,335 ) B. Revenue for the 1 st quarter of $46.1 million was up $8.5 million (22.5%) over the 1 st quarter of 2017. Revenue for the trailing 12 months of $176.4 million was up $12.0 million (7.3%) over the 12 months ending March 31, 2017. Our pharmaceutical group led the way with a quarter over quarter increase of $6.6 million as the large pharmaceutical order that was being worked on for most of 2017 began to ship.\nNet income for the 1 st quarter was $0.4 million compared to a slight loss for the first quarter of 2017. The first quarter 2018 results were dampened by an increase in the LIFO reserve of $0.6 million before tax.\nNet loss for the trailing twelve months was $1.8 million. These results were impacted by a pretax increase in the LIFO reserve of $1.3 million; one-time tax expense from the new tax legislation of $4.2 million; and approximately $2.0 million in non-reoccurring costs related to the consolidation in The Netherlands.\nThe net loss of $3.3 million for the twelve months ending March 31, 2017 was affected by a pretax impact of $0.5 increase in LIFO reserve and the $6.7 million in settlement charges from the lump sum pension payments.\nC. Backlog remained nearly unchanged for the quarter and is a robust $94.0 million at March 31st. Domestic backlog has decreased by $3.1 million for the quarter to end at $67.1 million. Backlog in The Netherlands continued to grow and was up $3.6 million to $28.5 million.\nD. Tax expense of approximately $4.2 million was recognized in December due to new United States federal tax legislation under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) enacted in December 2017. This includes a $0.9 million transition tax expense estimate and $3.3 million tax expense due to the revaluation of the deferred tax asset due to a decrease in the tax rate. In certain cases, the Company has recorded for 2017 a reasonable estimate of the effects of the TCJA, and accordingly such amounts are provisional. Final adjustments, if necessary, will be determined in 2018 and recorded as a measurement period adjustment through 2018 tax expense.\nE. Production started in the new facility in Groenlo as scheduled on April 9 th . Total debt on the new building is $25.9 million as of March 31 st .\nF. The pre-tax results for the three months ended March 31, 2018, were unfavorably affected by a $559,000 increase in the LIFO reserve. The pre-tax results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, were unfavorably affected by a $1,256,000 increase in the LIFO reserve. The pre-tax results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, were unfavorably affected by a $500,000 increase in the LIFO reserve.\nG. The Company completed the lump sum pension payments to participants who elected to take the settlement. These payments, paid from the assets of the plans, were available for participants who were no longer employed by the company as of May 6, 2016, but who had not yet begun receiving their benefit. The eligible participants represented about a quarter of the obligations of the plans and just over 50% of those eligible elected the settlement. The payments, totaling $13.8 million to 218 participants, were made on or about September 26, 2016. The results for twelve months ended December 31, 2016 contained a negative noncash effect on the pre-tax earnings of the Company of $6.7 million ($4.2 million net of tax).\nH. The consolidated financials are affected by the euro to dollar exchange rate when consolidating Mueller B.V., the Dutch subsidiary. The month-end euro to dollar exchange rate was 1.07 for March, 2017; 1.20 for December, 2017 and 1.23 for March, 2018, respectively.\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements that provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions.
