On the interest rate front, the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate rose 33 basis points, while shorter maturity Treasury rates and swap rates generally increased between 40 and 50 basis points. Consistent with the increase in volatility and wider credit spreads, spreads on Agency mortgage-backed securities (\"Agency MBS\") relative to benchmarks widened close to 10 basis points and were the primary driver of AGNC's book value decline during the first quarter,\" commented Gary Kain, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer. \"Fortunately, AGNC was very well positioned for the interest rate move as a direct result of the actions we took in the fourth quarter of last year to limit our duration gap. Our historically high hedge ratio minimized the impact of the movement in interest rates on our economic return and will continue to limit our exposure to further rate increases.\n\"While wider Agency MBS spreads were a significant contributor to the decline in our net book value in the first quarter, they also serve to improve the go-forward return profile of our new Agency MBS investment opportunities. As such, we continue to believe that Agency MBS provide the most attractive risk-adjusted returns for levered investors, especially when favorable funding trends are considered. By contrast, valuations of credit-sensitive mortgage investments returned to their recent highs in April, in turn reducing expected levered returns to levels that, in general, we do not find attractive.\"\n\"Late in the first quarter, the favorable funding dynamics for Agency MBS that we have discussed for several quarters improved meaningfully, augmenting our absolute return potential from Agency MBS,\" added Peter Federico, the Company's President and Chief Operating Officer. \"Specifically, the spread between Agency MBS repo funding and corresponding LIBOR rates widened significantly during the quarter, particularly in March. This favorable spread differential will increasingly manifest itself as our pay fixed-receive floating rate swaps reset, reducing the cost of these hedges and providing a tailwind to our cost of funds and, in turn, our net spread income. Finally, our currently high hedge ratio, limited duration gap and modest leverage provide several levers to enhance returns as market conditions evolve.\"\nTANGIBLE NET BOOK VALUE PER COMMON SHARE\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company's tangible net book value per common share was $18.63 per share, compared to $19.69 per share as of December 31, 2017. The decline of $(1.06) per common share, or -5.4%, was primarily due to wider mortgage spreads and, to a lesser extent, higher long-term rates during the first quarter. The Company's tangible net book value per common share excludes $550 million, or $1.41 per common share, of goodwill and other intangible assets as of March 31, 2018.\nINVESTMENT PORTFOLIO\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company's investment portfolio totaled $69.3 billion, comprised of:\n$68.4 billion of Agency MBS and TBA securities, including: $67.3 billion of fixed-rate securities, comprised of: $44.2 billion 30-year fixed-rate securities, $9.7 billion 30-year TBA securities, $8.8 billion 15-year securities, $3.9 billion 15-year TBA securities, and $0.7 billion 20-year fixed-rate securities; $0.8 billion of collateralized mortgage obligations (\"CMOs\"); and $0.3 billion of adjustable-rate securities; $0.9 billion of CRT and non-Agency securities; and $42 million of investments in REIT equity securities consisting of shares of MTGE Investment Corp. common stock.\nAs of March 31, 2018, inclusive of TBA securities, 30-year and 15-year Agency MBS fixed rate securities represented 78% and 18% of the Company's investment portfolio, respectively, largely unchanged from 77% and 19%, respectively, as of December 31, 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company's fixed-rate Agency MBS, inclusive of TBA securities, had a weighted average coupon of 3.57%, compared to 3.55% as of December 31, 2017, comprised of the following weighted average coupons:\n3.66% for 30-year fixed-rate securities; 3.20% for 15-year fixed rate securities; and 3.52% for 20-year fixed-rate securities.\nThe Company accounts for TBA securities (or \"dollar roll funded assets\") as derivative instruments and recognizes dollar roll income in other gain (loss), net on the Company's financial statements. As of March 31, 2018, the Company's net TBA position had a total fair value of $13.6 billion and a GAAP net carrying value of $82 million reported in derivative assets/(liabilities) on the Company's balance sheet, compared to a total fair value of $15.7 billion and a GAAP net carrying value of $3 million as of December 31, 2017.\nCONSTANT PREPAYMENT RATES\nThe Company's investment portfolio had a weighted average CPR of 8.6% for the first quarter, compared to 10.1% for the prior quarter. The weighted average projected CPR for the remaining life of the Company's Agency securities held as of March 31, 2018 was 7.6%, compared to 8.4% as of December 31, 2017.\nThe weighted average cost basis of the Company's investment portfolio was 104.7% of par value as of March 31, 2018. Net premium amortization cost on the Company's investment portfolio for the first quarter was $(69) million, or $(0.18) per common share, which includes a \"catch-up\" premium amortization benefit of $21 million, or $0.05 per common share, due to changes in the Company's projected CPR estimates for securities acquired prior to the first quarter. This compares to net premium amortization cost for the prior quarter of $(96) million, or $(0.25) per common share, including \"catch-up\" premium amortization cost of $(3) million, or $(0.01) per common share.\nASSET YIELDS, COST OF FUNDS AND NET INTEREST RATE SPREAD\nThe Company's average asset yield on its investment portfolio, excluding the net TBA position, was 3.05% for the first quarter, compared to 2.84% for the prior quarter. Excluding \"catch-up\" premium amortization, the Company's average asset yield was 2.90% for the first quarter, compared to 2.86% for the prior quarter. The Company's average asset yield including TBA securities and excluding \"catch-up\" premium amortization for the first quarter was 2.94%, an increase from 2.88% for the prior quarter.\nFor the first quarter, the weighted average interest rate on the Company's Agency repurchase agreements was 1.69%, compared to 1.43% for the prior quarter. The Company's average implied TBA funding cost was 1.49% for the first quarter, compared to 1.23% for the prior quarter. Inclusive of interest rate swap costs, the Company's combined average cost of funds for the first quarter was 1.68%, an increase from 1.52% for the prior quarter.\nThe Company's annualized net interest margin, including TBA securities and interest rate swap costs, was 1.38% for the first quarter, compared to 1.35% for the prior quarter. Excluding \"catch-up\" premium amortization, the Company's combined annualized net interest margin for the first quarter was 1.26%, compared to 1.36% for the prior quarter.\nNET SPREAD AND DOLLAR ROLL INCOME\nThe Company recognized $0.65 per common share of net spread and dollar roll income (a non-GAAP financial measure) for the first quarter, compared to $0.62 for the prior quarter. Excluding \"catch-up\" premium amortization, the Company's net spread and dollar roll income was $0.60 per common share for the first quarter, a decrease from $0.63 per common share for the prior quarter. A reconciliation of the Company's net interest income to net spread and dollar roll income and additional information regarding the Company's use of non-GAAP measures are included later in this release.\nLEVERAGE\nAs of March 31, 2018, $49.0 billion of Agency repo, $13.5 billion of TBA dollar roll positions (at cost) and $0.3 billion of other debt were used to fund the Company's investment portfolio. Inclusive of its net TBA position and net payable/(receivable) for unsettled securities, the Company's tangible net book value \"at risk\" leverage ratio was 8.2x as of March 31, 2018, compared to 8.1x as of December 31, 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company's Agency repurchase agreements had a weighted average interest rate of 1.82%, an increase from 1.57% as of December 31, 2017, and a weighted average remaining days to maturity of 109 days, compared to 116 days as of December 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2018, $18.8 billion, or 38%, of the Company's Agency repurchase agreements were funded through the Company's captive broker-dealer subsidiary, Bethesda Securities, LLC, compared to $16.6 billion, or 33%, as of December 31, 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company's Agency repurchase agreements had remaining maturities of:\n$37.8 billion of three months or less; $3.4 billion from three to six months; $4.2 billion from six to twelve months; and $3.6 billion from one to three years.\nHEDGING ACTIVITIES\nAs of March 31, 2018, 103% of the Company's outstanding balance of Agency repurchase agreements, other debt and net TBA position was hedged with interest rate swaps, swaptions and U.S. Treasury positions, compared to 97% as of December 31, 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company's interest rate swap position totaled $45.3 billion in notional amount, compared to $43.7 billion as of December 31, 2017.

During Q1 2018, the Company adopted new accounting guidance on revenue recognition, which resulted in reclassification of expense reimbursements from MTGE Investment Corp. from an operating expense offset to management fee income. Net income was not impacted. Prior periods have been revised accordingly, as applicable. Table includes non-GAAP financial measures and/or amounts derived from non-GAAP measures. Refer to \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\" for additional discussion of non-GAAP financial measures. Amount reported in gain (loss) on derivatives instruments and other securities, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Dollar roll income represents the price differential, or \"price drop,\" between the TBA price for current month settlement versus the TBA price for forward month settlement. Amount is net of TBAs used for hedging purposes. Amount excludes TBA mark-to-market adjustments. The implied funding cost of TBA dollar roll transactions is determined using the \"price drop\" (Note 5) and market based assumptions regarding the \"cheapest-to-deliver\" collateral that can be delivered to satisfy the TBA contract, such as the anticipated collateral's weighted average coupon, weighted average maturity and projected 1-month CPR. The average implied funding cost for all TBA transactions is weighted based on the Company's daily average TBA balance outstanding for the period. The average implied asset yield for TBA dollar roll transactions is extrapolated by adding the average TBA implied funding cost (Note 6) to the net dollar roll yield. The net dollar roll yield is calculated by dividing dollar roll income (Note 5) by the average TBA cost basis outstanding for the period. Amount calculated on a weighted average basis based on average balances outstanding during the period and their respective asset yield/funding cost. Represents periodic interest costs/income on the Company's interest rate swap portfolio. Amount excludes interest rate swap termination fees and mark-to-market adjustments. Interest rate swap cost of funds represents interest rate swap periodic costs measured as a percent of total mortgage funding (Agency repurchase agreements, other debt and TBA securities). \"Catch-up\" premium amortization cost/benefit is reported in interest income on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations Investment securities include Agency MBS, CRT and non-Agency securities. Amounts exclude TBA securities. Average repurchase agreements and other debt includes Agency repo and debt of consolidated VIE's. Amount excludes U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements. Average stockholders' equity calculated as the average month-ended stockholders' equity during the quarter. Average tangible net book value \"at risk\" leverage during the period was calculated by dividing the sum of the daily weighted average Agency repurchase agreements, other debt and net TBA position (at cost) outstanding for the period by the sum of average stockholders' equity adjusted to exclude investments in REIT equity securities and goodwill and other intangible assets. Leverage excludes U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements. Tangible net book value \"at risk\" leverage as of period end was calculated by dividing the sum of the amount outstanding under Agency repurchase agreements, other debt, net TBA position (at cost) and net receivable / payable for unsettled investment securities outstanding by the sum of total stockholders' equity adjusted to exclude investments in REIT equity securities and goodwill and other intangible assets at period end. Leverage excludes U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements. Includes forward starting swaps not yet in effect as of reported period-end. Economic return (loss) on tangible common equity represents the sum of the change in tangible net book value per common share and dividends declared on common stock during the period over the beginning tangible net book value per common share.\nSTOCKHOLDER CALL\nAGNC invites stockholders, prospective stockholders and analysts to attend the AGNC stockholder call on April 26, 2018 at 8:30 am ET.

For further information, please refer to www.AGNC.com .\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis press release contains Forward-looking statements are based on estimates, projections, beliefs and assumptions of management of the Company at the time of such statements and are not guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties in predicting future results and conditions. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in these due to a variety of important factors, including, without limitation, changes in interest rates, changes in the yield curve, changes in prepayment rates, the availability and terms of financing, changes in the market value of the Company's assets, general economic conditions, market conditions, conditions in the market for Agency securities, and legislative and regulatory changes that could adversely affect the business of the Company. Certain factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the , are included in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities (\"SEC\"). Copies are available on the SEC's website, www.sec.gov . The Company disclaims any obligation to update or revise any based on the occurrence of future events, the receipt or new information, or otherwise.\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nIn addition to the results presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company's results of operations discussed in this release include certain non-GAAP financial information, including \"net spread and dollar roll income,\" \"net spread and dollar roll income, excluding 'catch-up' premium amortization,\" \"economic interest income\" and \"economic interest expense\" (both components of \"net spread and dollar roll income\"), \"estimated taxable income\" and the related per common share measures and certain financial metrics derived from such non-GAAP information, such as \"cost of funds\" and \"net interest margin.\"\n\"Net spread and dollar roll income\" is measured as (i) net interest income (GAAP measure) adjusted to include TBA dollar roll income, interest rate swap periodic costs and dividend income from REIT equity securities (referred to as \"adjusted net interest and dollar roll income\"), plus (ii) management fee income (GAAP measure) and less (iii) total operating expense (GAAP measure). \"Net spread and dollar roll income, excluding 'catch-up' premium amortization,\" further excludes retrospective \"catch-up\" adjustments to premium amortization cost or benefit due to changes in projected CPR estimates. Related amounts available to common stockholders exclude non-recurring issuance costs of redeemed preferred stock.\nBy providing users of the Company's financial information with such measures in addition to the related GAAP measures, the Company believes users will have greater transparency into the information used by the Company's management in its financial and operational decision-making. The Company also believes that it is important for users of its financial information to consider information related to the Company's current financial performance without the effects of certain transactions that are not necessarily indicative of its current investment portfolio performance and operations.\nSpecifically, in the case of \"adjusted net interest and dollar roll income,\" the Company believes the inclusion of TBA dollar roll income is meaningful as TBAs, which are accounted for under GAAP as derivative instruments with gains and losses recognized in other gain (loss) in the Company's statement of operations, are economically equivalent to holding and financing generic Agency MBS using short-term repurchase agreements. Similarly, the Company believes that the inclusion of periodic interest rate swap settlements in such measure, which are recognized under GAAP in other gain (loss), is meaningful as interest rate swaps are the primary instrument the Company uses to economically hedge against fluctuations in the Company's borrowing costs and inclusion of periodic interest rate swap settlement costs is more indicative of the Company's total cost of funds than interest expense alone. In the case of \"net spread and dollar roll income, excluding 'catch-up' premium amortization,\" the Company believes the exclusion of \"catch-up\" adjustments to premium amortization cost or benefit is meaningful as it excludes the cumulative effect from prior reporting periods due to current changes in future prepayment expectations and, therefore, exclusion of such cost or benefit is more indicative of the current earnings potential of the Company's investment portfolio. The Company also believes the exclusion of issuance costs of redeemed preferred stock reported as a reduction to net income available to common stockholders under GAAP is meaningful as they represent non-recurring costs associated capital transactions and are not representative of ongoing costs. In the case of estimated taxable income, the Company believes it is meaningful information as it is directly related to the amount of dividends the Company is required to distribute in order to maintain its REIT qualification status.\nHowever, because such measures are incomplete measures of the Company's financial performance and involve differences from results computed in accordance with GAAP, they should be considered as supplementary to, and not as a substitute for, results computed in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of such non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies. Furthermore, estimated taxable income can include certain information that is subject to potential adjustments up to the time of filing the Company's income tax returns, which occurs after the end of its fiscal year.\nA reconciliation of GAAP net interest income to non-GAAP \"net spread and dollar roll income, excluding 'catch-up' premium amortization\" and a reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP \"estimated taxable income\" is included in this release.\nCONTACT:\nInvestors - (301) 968-9300\nMedia - (301) 968-9303\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/agnc-investment-corp-announces-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-300636596.html\nSOURCE AGNC Investment Corp.",
