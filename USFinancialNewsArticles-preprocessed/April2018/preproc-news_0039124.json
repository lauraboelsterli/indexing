    "text": "8 COMMENTS At first blush “I Feel Pretty” has a promising premise. A sad duckling who’s far from ugly, only pleasantly plump and plagued by self-doubt, suddenly believes herself to be drop-dead gorgeous, and her delusion releases her joyous, lovable self. At second blush, after I saw the film, it’s a botched premise. At third blush, after I thought about what I’d seen, the premise never had a chance of working out well in the hands of filmmakers whose take on their subject is sitcom-deep.\nMore Film Reviews\n‘Godard Mon Amour’ The duckling, Renee Bennett, is played by Amy Schumer, who knows how to sell a comic notion and commits to selling this one, come what may. Renee, whose only wish is to be beautiful, works for a global cosmetics company modeled on Revlon or L’Oréal, but she does so from the company’s online office, a squalid warren in a Chinatown basement. (Her sole co-worker, a guy, is a dim bulb, and a slob.) This establishes two things—the heroine’s obsession with physical appearance, and the movie’s devotion to selling plot points, however absurd they may be.\nAnd however arbitrary. Renee’s imagined transformation follows an evening at home, when, watching TV, she happens on a pivotal scene of “Big”—the one in which the disconsolate kid tells a carnival machine fatefully, “I wish I were big.” This is a praiseworthy example of truth in borrowing—if the “Big” people could transform a character just like that, the filmmakers seem to be saying, so can we. But it’s also a reminder to be careful what you wish for; some instant transformations have wondrous consequences, while some don’t. This one really doesn’t, notwithstanding Ms. Schumer’s gallant efforts, and despite our wishing the movie well for its message that beauty comes from within.\nRenee’s initial doubts about herself—doubts that verge on self-loathing—are an extension of what Ms. Schumer’s character felt in her previous, partly autobiographical and more successful feature, “Trainwreck.” As for the specifics of how Renee’s transformation takes place, they’re too silly to relate. The question is what happens next, and next, and next.\nAmy Schumer Photo: STXfilms After the kid in “Big” wakes up the next morning and is big enough to be played by Tom Hanks, our delight extends beyond the physical change to the sweetly naïve 13-year-old point of view that the ostensibly mature hero brings to the adult world around him. When Renee transmogrifies the day after she sees the scene from “Big,” it’s all in her head, since the co-writers and co-directors, Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein, have decided against the strategy of fantasy sequences, à la Danny Kaye’s Walter in “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty” or The Dude’s bowling-themed musical sequence in “The Big Lebowski.” Renee’s body remains as agreeably zaftig as it was, so the rest of the movie depends on her behavior, which is comically delusional if you buy it, and scarily demented if you don’t.\nAll the beautiful people in her company buy it, or at least go along with it, even when Renee, believing she’s a supermodel, talks febrile nonsense that no one questions. (The staff includes such real-life super, or superish, models as Naomi Campbell, Lauren Hutton and Emily Ratajkowski, whose character dutifully confesses her own insecurities.) Unshakably confident in her new state of grace, Renee rises quickly, if unaccountably, through the ranks, then achieves a position of eminence in the eyes of the company’s CEO, Avery LeClair, who’s played by Michelle Williams with a wan presence and squeaky, unfunny voice.\nAvery values Renee for the smart and sensible things she says about how the company should pitch its new lower-priced line of cosmetics to real women. (That’s an echo of Tom Hanks’s Josh giving toy company executives good advice on how to sell toys.) Still, there’s no accounting for the way Renee enchants the men she meets, although Ms. Schumer is very funny doing bumps, grinds and twists in a bikini dancing contest at a downtown club. In the eyes of the man who takes her there, a good though somewhat nebbishy soul named Ethan ( Rory Scovel ), she is perfect: “You’re so yourself,” he tells her ardently. According to Grant LeClair, Avery’s hunky brother, she is dazzling, though we don’t see it.\nAmy Schumer and Rory Scovel Photo: STXfilms Most of the compliments Renee receives are unearned, because much of the time she comes off like a runaway narcissist, the kind of woman any sensible man would flee in a New York second. The writers haven’t given her the nuance needed to differentiate confident from crazy, and the directors, who are two and the same, haven’t given the production as a whole consistent verve; the pace drags when it isn’t frenetic. Renee eventually reverts to her original self, as in “Big” (or in “Charly,” for that matter), though duly cured of her paralyzing insecurity, and she gets to deliver an earnest exhortation about the need for girls, as well as women, to believe in themselves. But it’s hard to believe in “I Feel Pretty,” a put-up job about a self-enchanted Cinderella.",
