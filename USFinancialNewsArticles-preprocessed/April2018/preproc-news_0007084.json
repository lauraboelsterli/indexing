The Pareteum multi-year Software-as-a-Service agreements include service establishment and implementation fees, guaranteed minimum monthly recurring fees, as well as contractually scheduled subscribers, in some cases including subscriber usage, during the term of the agreement, and, their resulting monthly recurring revenue. There can be no assurances that we reach the total revenue backlog. The revenue backlog assumes timing of revenue recognition that may vary from actual results.\nPareteum Investor Relations Contacts:\nTed O'Donnell\nChief Financial Officer\n(212) 984-1096\nInvestorRelations@pareteum.com\nHayden IR\n(917) 658-7878\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pareteum-announces-customer-go-live-deployments-in-europe-south-america-north-america-and-asia-pacific-300624857.html\nSOURCE Pareteum Corporation",
