    "text": "TORONTO and SPOKANE, Wash., April 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hydro One Limited (“Hydro One”) (TSX:H) and Avista Corporation (“Avista”) (NYSE:AVA) announced today that the 30-day waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, for the merger of the two companies expired on Thursday, April 5, 2018 at 11:59 p.m.\nThis expiration of the waiting period means that the parties have received antitrust clearance for their proposed merger and satisfies one of the closing conditions of the transaction.\nApplications for regulatory approval of the transaction are still pending with utility commissions in Washington, Idaho, Oregon, Montana and Alaska. An all-party, all-issues settlement agreement was filed with the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission on March 27, 2018. An all-party, all-issues settlement agreement was filed with the Regulatory Commission of Alaska on April 3, 2018.\nApproval must be obtained from the Federal Communications Commission. Also required is clearance by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, as well as the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.\nThe transaction received approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on January 16, 2018 and from Avista shareholders on November 21, 2017. Hydro One and Avista continue to anticipate closing the transaction in the second half of 2018.\nFor further information:\nHydro One\nMedia:\nJay Armitage\nDirector, Corporate Communications\nmedia.relations@hydroone.com , 416-345-6868\nInvestors:\nOmar Javed\nVice President, Investor Relations\ninvestor.relations@hydroone.com , 416-345-5943\nAvista\nMedia:\nCasey Fielder, Communications Manager\ncasey.fielder@avistacorp.com , 509-495-4916\nInvestors:\nLauren Pendergraft, Investor Relations Manager\nlauren.pendergraft@avistacorp.com , 509-495-2998\nAbout Hydro One Limited\nWe are Ontario's largest electricity transmission and distribution provider with more than 1.3 million valued customers, over C$25 billion in assets and 2017 annual revenues of nearly C$6 billion.
