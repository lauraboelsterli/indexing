Philadelphia had won four in a row and 11 of 13.\nAvila had only four hits in his first 34 at-bats, entering the game with a .114 batting average, but he figured in the first three Arizona rallies in a game that was played in a steady rain that began in the fifth inning.\nAfter Altherr’s double and Maikel Franco’s sacrifice fly gave the Phillies a 3-2 lead in the third inning off Arizona starter Robbie Ray, Avila singled around walks to Nick Ahmed and Dyson to open the fifth before David Peralta doubled in two runs off Phillies starter Vince Velasquez (1-3) to make it 4-3.\nAvila singled in a run in the fifth inning for a 5-3 lead.\nHernandez’s RBI single in the sixth inning cut the Phillies’ deficit to 5-4 before Arizona scored three in the eighth. Paul Goldschmidt singled, stole second and took third on a throwing error before A.J. Pollock singled him home. Pollock stole second before Descalso hit his third homer of the season.\nPollock and Peralta had two hits apiece. Fernando Salas (2-1) pitched one inning for the win.\nRay gave up five hits and three runs in 4 2/3 innings, striking out 11 and walking three. Ray has 145 strikeouts in 102 1/3 innings in his past 18 road starts, an average of 12.8 strikeouts per nine innings.\nVelasquez gave up four hits and four runs in 4 2/3 innings, ending a streak of three straight quality starts. He struck out six and walked two.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
