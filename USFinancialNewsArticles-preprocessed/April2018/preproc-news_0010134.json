    "text": "UNITED NATIONS, April 9 (Reuters) - Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said on Monday that the Moscow has warned the United States of “grave repercussions” if it carries out an attack against Syrian government forces over reports of a deadly chemical weapons attack.\n“There was no chemical weapons attack,” Nebenzia told the U.N. Security Council. “Through the relevant channels we already conveyed to the U.S. that armed force under mendacious pretext against Syria – where, at the request of the legitimate government of a country, Russian troops have been deployed - could lead to grave repercussions.”\nHe also said that investigators with the global chemical weapons watchdog should fly to Syria as early as Tuesday to look into accusations about the attack, offering them protection from Syrian authorities and Russian troops.
