Quoting an unnamed source, it said the Guards had confiscated a computer, CDs and notebooks from Edalat when he was arrested.\nA CHRI statement said Edalat’s family posted bail for him on April 21 but the Revolutionary Court in Tehran did not release him, citing problems with documentation.\nCHRI did not specify what charges may have been brought against Edalat. The Iranian judiciary could not be reached for comment.
