    "text": "First Quarter 2018 Overview\nRevenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $43.1 million, a 4% increase compared to $41.6 million for the first quarter of 2017. GAAP net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $4.8 million compared to net income of $1.1 million for the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $(1.2) million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $(1.0) million for the first quarter of 2017. Net cash provided by operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $10.7 million compared to $8.4 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nEffective January 1, 2018, eHealth adopted Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606), using the full retrospective method. Prior period information presented has been adjusted to reflect the adoption of this new revenue recognition standard.\nMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- eHealth, Inc. (NASDAQ: EHTH), a leading private online health insurance exchange, announced today its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nScott Flanders, chief executive officer of eHealth stated, “We had a great start to the year at eHealth with double-digit enrollment growth and 21% revenue growth in the Medicare segment. This growth generated significant Medicare segment profit as we meaningfully reduced variable marketing costs per approved member compared to a year ago and continued to improve customer conversion rates throughout the quarter. We expanded and strengthened our approach to the Medicare Supplement market with the acquisition of GoMedigap whose early performance and integration are on target. Our small group business also performed well with the number of approved members increasing by more than 50% year-over-year. Only the individual and family plan business remained challenged for us, although we expect that recent changes in leadership and our go to market approach will allow us to gain better traction in the Individual market later in the year. The company is singularly focused on executing against the growth targets we established on our year-end earnings call, and I view our first quarter performance as a strong start toward achieving those objectives.”\nGAAP — First Quarter of 2018 Results\nRevenue — Revenue for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $43.1 million, a 4% increase compared to $41.6 million for the first quarter of 2017.

These expectations are forward-looking statements, and eHealth assumes no obligation to update these statements. Actual results may be materially different and are affected by the risk factors and uncertainties identified in this release and in eHealth’s annual and quarterly filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nDave Francis, chief financial and operating officer of eHealth said, “Our operational outlook for the year remains unchanged and we are reaffirming the revenue, GAAP net income, adjusted EBITDA, and segment revenue and profitability guidance for the full year 2018 that we initially provided on our fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. At the same time, our reporting of tax obligations as a result of adopting ASC 606 for GAAP purposes changed recently. While this change does not affect our cash tax expectations for this year, the accounting for our tax obligations has been adjusted, with the net effect being that we expect to report an effective full tax rate of approximately 27.5% for 2018 as opposed to tax expense of minimum cash taxes. As a result, we are adjusting our financial guidance as it relates to non-GAAP net income.”\neHealth is revising its non-GAAP net income guidance for the full year ending December 31, 2018 as follows:\nNon-GAAP net income per diluted share is expected to be in the range of $0.69 to $0.95 per share. This compares to our prior expectations of $0.92 to $1.18 per share.\neHealth is reaffirming its remaining guidance for the full year ending December 31, 2018 as follows:\nTotal revenue is expected to be in the range of $217.5 million to $227.5 million. Revenue from the Medicare segment is expected to be in the range of $178.5 million to $183.5 million. Revenue from the Individual, Family and Small Business segment is expected to be in the range of $39.0 million to $44.0 million. GAAP net income is expected to be in the range of $1.6 million to $6.6 million. Adjusted EBITDA (a) is expected to be in the range of $21.9 million to $26.9 million. Medicare segment profit (b) for the year ending December 31, 2018 is expected to be in the range of $45.5 million to $49.5 million. Individual, Family and Small Business segment profit (b) for the year ending December 31, 2018 is expected to be in the range of $6.0 million to $7.0 million. Corporate (c) shared service expenses, excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization expense, is expected to be approximately $29.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA per diluted share (e) is expected to be in the range of $1.13 to $1.39 per share.\n(a) Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expense, restructuring charges, acquisition costs, amortization of intangible assets, other income (expense) and provision for income taxes to GAAP net income.\n(b) Segment profit is calculated as revenue for the applicable segment less Marketing and Advertising, Customer Care and Enrollment, Technology and Content and General and Administrative operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expense and amortization of intangible assets, that are directly attributable to the applicable segment and other indirect Marketing and Advertising, Customer Care and Enrollment and Technology and Content operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expense and amortization of intangible assets, allocated to the applicable segment based on usage.\n(c) Corporate consists of other indirect General and Administrative operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization expense, which are managed in a corporate shared services environment and, since they are not the responsibility of segment operating management, are not allocated to the reportable segments.\n(d) Non-GAAP net income per diluted share is calculated by adding stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, acquisition costs, intangible asset amortization expense and the income tax effect of these adjustments to GAAP net income.\n(e) Adjusted EBITDA per diluted share is calculated by adding stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expense, restructuring charges, acquisition costs, amortization of intangible assets, other income (expense) and provision for income taxes to GAAP net income per share.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nA Webcast and conference call will be held today, Thursday, April 26, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern / 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time.

To supplement eHealth’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, eHealth presents investors with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP operating income (loss); non-GAAP operating margins; adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA); non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDA per share.\nNon-GAAP operating income (loss) consists of GAAP operating income (loss) excluding the following items: the effects of expensing stock-based compensation related to stock options and restricted stock units, acquisition costs, restructuring charges, and amortization of intangible assets. Non-GAAP operating margins are calculated by dividing non-GAAP operating income (loss) by GAAP total revenue. Non-GAAP net income (loss) consists of GAAP net income (loss) excluding the following items: the effects of expensing stock-based compensation related to stock options and restricted stock units, acquisition costs, restructuring charges, amortization of intangible assets, and the income tax impact of excluded items. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expense, acquisition costs, restructuring charges, amortization of intangible assets, other income (expense) and provision (benefit) for income taxes to GAAP net income (loss).\neHealth believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provide important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to eHealth’s financial condition and results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with eHealth’s past financial reports. Management also believes that the items described above provides an additional measure of eHealth’s operating results and facilitates comparisons of eHealth’s core operating performance against prior periods and business model objectives. This information is provided to investors in order to facilitate additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate eHealth’s ongoing operations. eHealth believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in their assessment of eHealth’s operating performance.\nNon-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margins, Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDA per share are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, and should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the revenue and costs associated with the operations of eHealth’s business and do not reflect income tax as determined in accordance with GAAP. As a result, you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of eHealth’s results as reported under GAAP. eHealth expects to continue to incur the stock-based compensation costs and purchased intangible asset amortization costs described above, and exclusion of these costs, and their related income tax benefits, from non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual or infrequent. eHealth compensates for these limitations by prominently disclosing GAAP operating income (loss), GAAP operating margins, GAAP net income (loss) and GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share and providing investors with reconciliations from eHealth’s GAAP operating results to the non-GAAP financial measures for the relevant periods.\nThe accompanying tables provide more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to the non-GAAP financial measures described above and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.\nEHEALTH, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In thousands, unaudited)\nDecember 31,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2018\nAssets Current assets: Cash and

evaluate our business performance and manage our operations as two distinct reporting segments:\nMedicare and Individual, Family and Small Business.\n(1) The Medicare segment consists primarily of amounts earned from our sale of Medicare-related health insurance plans, including Medicare Advantage, Medicare Supplement and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, and to a lesser extent, ancillary products sold to our Medicare-eligible customers, including but not limited to, dental, vision, life, short term disability and long term disability insurance, our advertising program that allows Medicare-related carriers to purchase advertising on a separate website developed, hosted and maintained by us and our delivery and sale to third parties of Medicare-related health insurance leads generated by our ecommerce platforms and our marketing activities. (2) The Individual, Family and Small Business segment consists primarily of amounts earned from our sale of individual and family and small business health insurance plans and ancillary products sold to our non-Medicare-eligible customers, including but not limited to, dental, vision, life, short term disability and long term disability insurance.

To the extent we determine we have received substantially all of the commission payments related to a given month during the period being estimated, we will take the number of members for whom we have received or applied a commission payment during the month of estimation. Estimated number of members active on Medicare-related health insurance as of the date indicated based on the number of members for whom we have received or applied a commission payment during the month of estimation. (2) To estimate the number of members on Individual and Family health insurance plans, we take the sum of (i) the number of IFP members for whom we have received or applied a commission payment for a month that is up to six months prior to the date of estimation after reducing that number using historical experience for assumed member cancellations over the period being estimated; and (ii) the number of approved members over that period (after reducing that number by the percentage of members who do not accept their approved policy from the same month of the previous year for estimated member cancellations through the date of the estimate). To the extent we determine we have received substantially all of the commission payments related to a given month during the period being estimated, we will take the number of members for whom we have received or applied a commission payment during the month of estimation. For IFP health insurance plans, a member who purchases and is active on multiple standalone insurance plans will be counted as a member more than once. For example, a member who is active on both an individual and family health insurance plan and a standalone dental plan will be counted as two continuing members.\nEHEALTH, INC.\nSUMMARY OF SELECTED METRICS\nESTIMATED MEMBERSHIP (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\n(3) For ancillary health insurance plans (such as short-term, dental and vision insurance), we take the sum of (i) the number of members for whom we have received or applied a commission payment for a month that is up to three months prior to the date of estimation (after reducing that number using historical experience for assumed member cancellations over the period being estimated); and (ii) the number of approved members over that period (after reducing that number using historical experience for an assumed number of members who do not accept their approved policy from the same month of the previous year and for estimated member cancellations through the date of the estimate). To the extent we determine we have received substantially all of the commission payments related to a given month during the period being estimated, we will take the number of members for whom we have received or applied a commission payment during the month of estimation. The one to three-month period varies by insurance product and is largely dependent upon the timeliness of commission payment and related reporting from the related carriers. (4) For small business health insurance plans, we estimate the number of members using the number of initial members at the time the group is approved, and we update this number for changes in membership if such changes are reported to us by the group or carrier in the period it is reported. However, groups generally notify the carrier directly of policy cancellations and increases or decreases in group size without informing us. Health insurance carriers often do not communicate policy cancellation information or group size changes to us. We often are made aware of policy cancellations and group size changes at the time of annual renewal and update our membership statistics accordingly in the period they are reported. Health insurance carrier’s bill and collect insurance premiums paid by our members. The carriers do not report to us the number of members that we have as of a given date. The majority of our members who terminate their policies do so by discontinuing their premium payments to the carrier and do not inform us of the cancellation. Also, some of our members pay their premiums less frequently than monthly. Given the number of months required to observe non-payment of commissions in order to confirm cancellations, we estimate the number of members who are active on insurance policies as of a specified date.\nAfter we have estimated membership for a period, we may receive information from health insurance carriers that would have impacted the estimate if we had received the information prior to the date of estimation. We may receive commission payments or other information that indicates that a member who was not included in our estimates for a prior period was in fact an active member at that time, or that a member who was included in our estimates was in fact not an active member of ours. For instance, we reconcile information carriers provide to us and may determine that we were not historically paid commissions owed to us, which would cause us to have underestimated membership. Conversely, carriers may require us to return commission payments paid in a prior period due to policy cancellations for members we previously estimated as being active. We do not update our estimated membership numbers reported in previous periods. Instead, we reflect updated information regarding our historical membership in the membership estimate for the current period. As a result of the delay in our receipt of information from insurance carriers, actual trends in our membership are most discernible over periods longer than from one quarter to the next. As a result of the delay we experience in receiving information about our membership, it is difficult for us to determine with any certainty the impact of current conditions on our membership retention. Health care reform and its impacts as well as other factors could cause the assumptions and estimates that we make in connection with estimating our membership to be inaccurate, which would cause our membership estimates to be inaccurate.\nEHEALTH, INC.\nSUMMARY OF SELECTED METRICS\nCONSTRAINED LIFETIME VALUE OF\nCOMMISSIONS PER APPROVED MEMBER\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2017 2018 Percentage\nChange\nMedicare Medicare Advantage (1) $ 892 $ 880 (1)% Medicare Supplement (1) $ 932 $ 1,029 10 %\nMedicare Part D (1) $ 268 $ 270 1 %\nIndividual and Family Non-Qualified Health Plans (1) $ 139 $ 140 1 %\nQualified Health Plans (1) $ 134 $ 134 — %\nAncillaries Short-term (1) $ 87 $ 60 (31)% Dental (1) $ 71 $ 74 4 %\nVision (1) $ 53 $ 51 (4)% Small Business (2) $ 168 $ 178 6 %\nConstrained Lifetime Value of Commissions Per Approved Member\n(1) Constrained lifetime value (“LTV”) of commissions per approved member represents commissions estimated to be collected over the estimated life of an approved member’s policy after applying constraints in accordance with our revenue recognition policy.
