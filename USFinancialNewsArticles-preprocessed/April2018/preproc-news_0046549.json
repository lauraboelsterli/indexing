TCF Financial Corporation (\"TCF\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: TCF) today reported net income of $73.8 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $46.3 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $101.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Diluted earnings per common share was 39 cents for the first quarter of 2018 (inclusive of a one-time reduction in net income available to common stockholders of 2 cents per common share related to the redemption of the 6.45% Series B non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock in the first quarter of 2018), compared with 25 cents for the first quarter of 2017 and 57 cents for the fourth quarter of 2017 (inclusive of a 29 cents per common share impact from the estimated net tax benefit related to tax reform, goodwill and other intangible assets impairment, severance, other asset impairments, lease termination write-offs associated with the discontinuation of auto finance loan originations and additional TCF Foundation contribution, one-time team member bonuses, planned closure of five branches and inventory finance program extension).\n“We delivered a strong start to our year in the first quarter with a continued focus on our four strategic pillars, which drove profitable growth and improved financial performance,” said Craig R. Dahl, chairman and chief executive officer. “We are seeing the continued benefits of an asset sensitive balance sheet as our earning asset yields expanded in the quarter, especially in our variable- and adjustable-rate portfolios. Our efficiency ratio improved on a year-over-year basis and we project further improvement throughout 2018. In addition, the run-off of our auto finance portfolio progressed as expected in the first full quarter following our discontinuation of originations, while our overall credit quality remained strong. Finally, we successfully executed various capital initiatives including the redemption of our Series B preferred stock and additional share repurchases.\n“As we look to build on our first quarter momentum for the balance of the year, we are focused on driving shareholder value through strong execution of our strategy. We are taking steps to reduce the risk profile of our balance sheet to further lower our credit, operational and liquidity risks. We also maintain a positive outlook for our diversified lending businesses, including consumer real estate, commercial, leasing and equipment finance and inventory finance businesses from a growth, profitability and credit quality perspective. As a result, I believe we are well-positioned to improve our return on average tangible common equity in 2018 while utilizing capital more efficiently and reducing our overall risk profile.”\nRevenue\nTotal Revenue Table 2 Change 1Q 4Q 1Q 1Q18 vs 1Q18 vs (Dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 2017 4Q17 1Q17 Total interest income $ 275,262 $ 270,628 $ 242,307 1.7 % 13.6 % Total interest expense 32,063 28,768 20,193 11.5 58.8 Net interest income 243,199 241,860 222,114 0.6 9.5 Non-interest income: Fees and service charges 30,751 33,267 31,282 (7.6 ) (1.7 ) Card revenue 13,759 14,251 13,150 (3.5 ) 4.6 ATM revenue 4,650 4,654 4,675 (0.1 ) (0.5 ) Subtotal 49,160 52,172 49,107 (5.8 ) 0.1 Gains on sales of auto loans, net — 2,216\n2,864 (100.0 ) (100.0 ) Gains on sales of consumer real estate loans, net 9,123 11,407 8,891 (20.0 ) 2.6 Servicing fee income 8,295 9,000 11,651 (7.8 ) (28.8 ) Subtotal 17,418 22,623 23,406 (23.0 ) (25.6 ) Leasing and equipment finance 41,847 42,831 28,298 (2.3 ) 47.9 Other 3,716 3,218 2,703 15.5 37.5 Fees and other revenue 112,141 120,844 103,514 (7.2 ) 8.3 Gains (losses) on securities, net 63 48 — 31.3 N.M.

Net Interest Income\nNet interest income for the first quarter of 2018 increased $21.1 million, or 9.5 percent, from the first quarter of 2017 and $1.3 million, or 0.6 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase from the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to increased interest income on loans and leases held for investment, partially offset by an increase in total interest expense and a decrease in interest income on loans held for sale. Total interest income increased $33.0 million, or 13.6 percent, from the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to higher average balances and increased average yields on inventory finance loans and leasing and equipment finance loans and leases, as well as increased average yields and higher average balances of commercial loans. Total interest expense increased $11.9 million, or 58.8 percent, from the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to increased average rates and higher average balances of certificates of deposit and increased average rates on long-term borrowings and savings accounts, partially offset by lower average balances of money market accounts. The increase in net interest income from the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to increased interest income on loans and leases held for investment, partially offset by an increase in total interest expense. Total interest income increased $4.6 million, or 1.7 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to higher average balances and increased average yields on inventory finance loans, partially offset by lower average balances of auto finance and consumer real estate loans. Total interest expense increased $3.3 million, or 11.5 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to increased average rates and higher average balances of long-term borrowings and increased average rates on certificates of deposit and savings accounts. Net interest margin was 4.59 percent for the first quarter of 2018, up 13 basis points from the first quarter of 2017 and up 2 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase from the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to increased average yields on the variable- and adjustable-rate loan portfolios as a result of interest rate increases, partially offset by increased average rates and higher average balances of certificates of deposit and increased average rates on long-term borrowings and savings accounts. The increase from the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to increased average yields on seasonally higher average balances of inventory finance loans, partially offset by lower average balances of auto finance loans, increased average rates on higher average balances of long-term borrowings and increased average rates on certificates of deposit and savings accounts.\nNon-interest Income\nTCF sold $266.3 million, $379.4 million and $359.7 million of consumer real estate loans during the first quarter of 2018 and 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively, resulting in net gains in each respective period. Servicing fee income was $8.3 million on $4.5 billion of average loans and leases serviced for others for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $11.7 million on $5.6 billion for the first quarter of 2017 and $9.0 million on $4.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017. The decreases from both periods were primarily due to run-off in the auto finance serviced for others portfolio. Servicing fee income on auto finance loans serviced for others comprised $6.4 million of total servicing fee income for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $9.8 million and $7.1 million for the first quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively. Servicing fee income on consumer real estate loans serviced for others comprised $1.5 million of total servicing fee income for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2017. Leasing and equipment finance non-interest income for the first quarter of 2018 increased $13.5 million, or 47.9 percent, from the first quarter of 2017 and was consistent with the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase from the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to an increase in operating lease revenue, mainly driven by the acquisition of a leasing company in the second quarter of 2017 and an increase in sales-type lease revenue.\nLoans and Leases\nPeriod-End and Average Loans and Leases Table 3 Percent Change 1Q 4Q 1Q 1Q18 vs 1Q18 vs (Dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 2017 4Q17 1Q17 Period-End: Consumer real estate: First mortgage lien $ 1,878,441 $ 1,959,387 $ 2,166,691 (4.1 )% (13.3 )% Junior lien 2,843,221 2,860,309 2,494,696 (0.6 ) 14.0 Total consumer real estate 4,721,662 4,819,696 4,661,387 (2.0 ) 1.3 Commercial 3,678,181 3,561,193 3,376,050 3.3 8.9 Leasing and equipment finance 4,666,239 4,761,661 4,276,008 (2.0 ) 9.1 Inventory finance 3,457,855 2,739,754 2,864,248 26.2 20.7 Auto finance 2,839,363 3,199,639 2,780,416 (11.3 ) 2.1 Other 19,854 22,517 16,785 (11.8 ) 18.3 Total $ 19,383,154 $ 19,104,460 $ 17,974,894 1.5 7.8 Average: Consumer real estate: First mortgage lien $ 1,918,677 $ 1,959,067 $ 2,237,801 (2.1 )% (14.3 )% Junior lien 2,879,995 3,013,356 2,791,200 (4.4 ) 3.2 Total consumer real estate 4,798,672 4,972,423 5,029,001 (3.5 ) (4.6 ) Commercial 3,601,020 3,536,725 3,302,891 1.8 9.0 Leasing and equipment finance 4,690,868 4,713,015 4,285,944 (0.5 ) 9.4 Inventory finance 3,128,290 2,688,387 2,696,787 16.4 16.0 Auto finance 3,020,187 3,267,855 2,714,862 (7.6 ) 11.2 Other 14,446 13,007 9,740 11.1 48.3 Total $ 19,253,483 $ 19,191,412 $ 18,039,225 0.3 6.7 Period-end loans and leases were $19.4 billion at March 31, 2018, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 7.8 percent, from March 31, 2017 and $278.7 million, or 1.5 percent, from December 31, 2017. Average loans and leases were $19.3 billion for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 6.7 percent, from the first quarter of 2017 and consistent with the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe increase from March 31, 2017 for period-end loans and leases was primarily due to increases in the inventory finance, leasing and equipment finance and commercial portfolios. The increase from the first quarter of 2017 for average loans and leases was primarily due to increases in the inventory finance, leasing and equipment finance, auto finance and commercial portfolios, partially offset by a decrease in the consumer real estate portfolio. The increases in the inventory finance portfolio were primarily due to strong originations and expansion of the number of active dealers. The increases in the leasing and equipment finance portfolio were primarily due to a loan and lease portfolio purchase of $445.5 million on September 29, 2017. The increase in the average auto finance portfolio was primarily attributable to the reclassification of loans from held for sale to held for investment during the second quarter of 2017, partially offset by the discontinuation of auto finance loan originations effective December 1, 2017. The increases in the commercial portfolio were primarily due to strong originations. The decrease in the average consumer real estate portfolio was primarily due to a decrease in the first mortgage lien portfolio due to run-off and lower originations.\nThe increase from December 31, 2017 for period-end loans and leases was primarily due to increases in the inventory finance and commercial portfolios, partially offset by decreases in the auto finance, consumer real estate and leasing and equipment finance portfolios. The increase in the inventory finance portfolio was primarily due to a seasonally higher balance in the lawn and garden marketing segment and strong originations. The increase in the commercial portfolio was primarily due to lower pay-offs. The decrease in the auto finance portfolio was primarily attributable to the discontinuation of auto finance loan originations and run-off in the portfolio. The decrease in the consumer real estate portfolio was primarily due to a decrease in the first mortgage lien portfolio due to run-off and lower originations. The decrease in the leasing and equipment finance portfolio was primarily due to lower originations. Loan and lease originations were $3.8 billion for the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of $196.6 million, or 4.9 percent, from the first quarter of 2017 and $116.8 million, or 3.0 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease from the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to discontinuing auto finance originations and decreased consumer real estate originations, partially offset by higher inventory finance and commercial originations. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to discontinuing auto finance originations and decreased leasing and equipment finance, commercial and consumer real estate originations, partially offset by higher inventory finance originations.\nCredit Quality\nCredit Trends Table 4 Change 1Q 4Q 3Q 2Q 1Q 1Q18 vs 1Q18 vs (Dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 2017 2017 2017 4Q17 1Q17 Over 60-day delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loans and leases (1) 0.10 % 0.12 % 0.13 % 0.11 % 0.09 % (2) bps 1 bps Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases (2), (3), (4) 0.29 0.38 0.18 0.28 0.11 (9 ) 18 Non-accrual loans and leases and other real estate owned $ 143,607 $ 136,807 $ 146,024 $ 158,000 $ 170,940 5.0 % (16.0 ) % Provision for credit losses 11,368 22,259 14,545 19,446 12,193 (48.9 ) (6.8 ) (1) Excludes non-accrual loans and leases.

The over 60-day delinquency rate, excluding non-accrual loans and leases, was 0.10 percent at March 31, 2018, up 1 basis point from the March 31, 2017 rate and down 2 basis points from the December 31, 2017 rate. The increase from March 31, 2017 was primarily due to higher delinquencies in the auto finance portfolio, partially offset by improved delinquencies in the first mortgage lien consumer real estate portfolio. The decrease from December 31, 2017 was primarily due to improved delinquencies in the auto finance and leasing and equipment finance portfolios. The net charge-off rate was 0.29 percent for the first quarter of 2018, up 18 basis points from the first quarter of 2017 and down 9 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase from the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to the recovery of $8.7 million in the first quarter of 2017 on previous charge-offs related to the consumer real estate non-accrual loans that were sold and increased net charge-offs in the auto finance portfolio, partially offset by decreased net charge-offs in the commercial portfolio. Excluding the $8.7 million recovery from the consumer real estate non-accrual loan sale, the net charge-off rate was 0.31 percent for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to decreased net charge-offs in the leasing and equipment finance portfolio. Non-accrual loans and leases and other real estate owned were $143.6 million at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $27.3 million, or 16.0 percent, from March 31, 2017 and an increase of $6.8 million, or 5.0 percent, from December 31, 2017. Non-accrual loans and leases were $126.4 million at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $12.6 million, or 9.0 percent, from March 31, 2017 and an increase of $7.8 million, or 6.6 percent, from December 31, 2017. The decrease from March 31, 2017 was primarily due to the $21.8 million consumer real estate non-accrual loan sale in the third quarter of 2017, partially offset by an increase in non-accrual loans and leases in the leasing and equipment finance portfolio. The increase from December 31, 2017 was primarily due to increases in non-accrual loans and leases in the commercial and leasing and equipment finance portfolios. Other real estate owned was $17.2 million at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $14.8 million, or 46.2 percent, from March 31, 2017 and $1.0 million, or 5.7 percent, from December 31, 2017. The decreases from both periods were primarily due to sales of consumer real estate properties outpacing additions. The decrease from March 31, 2017 was also due to sales of commercial real estate properties. Provision for credit losses was $11.4 million for the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of $0.8 million, or 6.8 percent, from the first quarter of 2017 and $10.9 million, or 48.9 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease from the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to run-off in the auto finance portfolio and decreased net charge-offs in the commercial portfolio, partially offset by increased net charge-offs in the consumer real estate portfolio mainly driven by the recovery of $8.7 million in the first quarter of 2017 on previous charge-offs related to the consumer real estate non-accrual loans that were sold. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to run-off in the auto finance portfolio, decreased net charge-offs in the leasing and equipment finance portfolio and a decreased reserve rate for the inventory finance portfolio, partially offset by seasonal growth in the inventory finance portfolio.\nDeposits\nAverage Deposits Table 5\nChange 1Q 4Q 1Q 1Q18 vs 1Q18 vs (Dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 2017 4Q17 1Q17 Checking $ 6,192,310 $ 6,098,522 $ 5,914,203 1.5 % 4.7 % Savings 5,410,652 5,154,216 4,773,788 5.0 13.3 Money market 1,698,064 1,854,442 2,385,353 (8.4 ) (28.8 ) Certificates of deposit 4,998,133 5,032,085 4,033,143 (0.7 ) 23.9 Total average deposits $ 18,299,159 $ 18,139,265 $ 17,106,487 0.9 7.0 Average interest rate on deposits (1) 0.50 % 0.46 % 0.33 % 4 bps 17 bps (1) Annualized.

The increase from the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to an increase in operating lease depreciation, partially offset by a decrease in other non-interest expense. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to decreases in other non-interest expense and compensation and employee benefits expense. Compensation and employee benefits expense for the first quarter of 2018 was consistent with the first quarter of 2017 and decreased $3.8 million, or 3.0 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to one-time team member bonuses recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 and lower headcount in the auto finance business. Other non-interest expense decreased $5.4 million, or 8.4 percent, from the first quarter of 2017 and $100.2 million, or 63.0 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease from the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to decreases in severance expense, loan and lease processing expense and professional fees, partially offset by increases in advertising and marketing expense and outside processing expense. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to fourth quarter 2017 charges related to the discontinuation of auto finance loan originations, including goodwill and other intangible assets impairment charges of $73.4 million and severance, asset impairment and lease termination write-offs of $14.8 million, as well as the donation to TCF Foundation of $5.0 million. Operating lease depreciation increased $6.0 million, or 53.7 percent, from the first quarter of 2017 and was consistent with the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase from the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to an increase in leasing and equipment finance operating lease revenue related to the acquisition of a leasing company in the second quarter of 2017.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Company's effective income tax rate was 22.1% for the first quarter of 2018, compared with 30.0% for the first quarter of 2017. The effective tax rates for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017 were impacted by $1.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively, of tax benefits related to stock compensation.\nCapital\nCapital Information Table 7 At Mar. 31, At Dec. 31, (Dollars in thousands, except per-share data) 2018 2017 Total equity $ 2,550,950 $ 2,680,584 Book value per common share 13.89 13.96 Tangible book value per common share (1) 12.84 12.92 Common equity to assets 10.06 % 10.42 % Tangible common equity to tangible assets (1) 9.37 9.72 At Mar. 31, At Dec. 31, Regulatory Capital: 2018 (2) 2017 Common equity Tier 1 capital $ 2,222,390 $ 2,242,410 Tier 1 capital 2,414,838 2,522,178 Total capital 2,786,637 2,889,323 Regulatory Capital Ratios: Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio 10.57 % 10.79 % Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio 11.49 12.14 Total risk-based capital ratio 13.26 13.90 Tier 1 leverage ratio 10.52 11.12 (1) See \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" table.

Since it is not possible to foresee all such factors, these factors should not be considered as complete or exhaustive.\nAdverse Economic or Business Conditions; Competitive Conditions; Credit and Other Risks. Deterioration in general economic and banking industry conditions, including those arising from government shutdowns, defaults, anticipated defaults or rating agency downgrades of sovereign debt (including debt of the U.S.), or increases in unemployment; adverse economic, business and competitive developments such as shrinking interest margins, reduced demand for financial services and loan and lease products, deposit outflows, increased deposit costs due to competition for deposit growth and evolving payment system developments, deposit account attrition or an inability to increase the number of deposit accounts; customers completing financial transactions without using a bank; adverse changes in credit quality and other risks posed by TCF's loan, lease, investment, debt securities held to maturity and debt securities available for sale portfolios, including declines in commercial or residential real estate values, changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses dictated by new market conditions or regulatory requirements, or the inability of home equity line borrowers to make increased payments caused by increased interest rates or amortization of principal; deviations from estimates of prepayment rates and fluctuations in interest rates that result in decreases in the value of assets such as interest-only strips that arise in connection with TCF's loan sales activity; interest rate risks resulting from fluctuations in prevailing interest rates or other factors that result in a mismatch between yields earned on TCF's interest-earning assets and the rates paid on its deposits and borrowings; foreign currency exchange risks; counterparty risk, including the risk of defaults by our counterparties or diminished availability of counterparties who satisfy our credit quality requirements; decreases in demand for the types of equipment that TCF leases or finances; the effect of any negative publicity; the effects of man-made and natural disasters, including fires, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, acts of terrorism, civil disturbances and environmental damage, which may negatively affect our operations and/or our customers.\nLegislative and Regulatory Requirements.
