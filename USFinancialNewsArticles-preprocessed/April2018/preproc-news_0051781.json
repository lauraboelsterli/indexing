    "text": "0 COMMENTS Advertising spending cutbacks by packaged-goods brands appear to be slowing, according to Interpublic Group of Cos. Chief Executive Michael Roth, a strong signal that a trend plaguing ad agencies’ earnings may finally be easing.\nSome of the world’s biggest consumer-goods companies have been ratcheting down spending over the past year, as they struggle to compete in an increasingly competitive e-commerce marketplace. That “bleeding” now seems to be slowing down and “in some cases it’s stopped,” Mr. Roth said during the company’s first-quarter earnings call on Friday.\nNow, the CEOs of consumer-packaged-goods (CPG) companies are acknowledging that they need to invest in marketing if they want to continue to grow, said Mr. Roth.\nCPG clients continue to face pressure on margins and are seeking greater efficiencies in how they work with agencies. But, “clients are realizing that you can’t continue not to spend marketing dollars and drive revenue,” he said. “It’s hard to cut just expenses without revenue to increase margin.”\n“That’s an opportunity for us,” he said. As long as the macro environment continues to be positive, he said, “clients will feel more comfortable spending.”\nCPG was among IPG’s top client sectors in the first quarter, along with with financial services, health care, and auto and transportation.\nIPG’s total revenue increased 5.1% to $2.17 billion during the quarter.\nOrganic net revenue, which strips out currency fluctuations and acquisitions, increased 3.6% in the quarter. U.S. organic net revenue growth was 4.3%.\nMr. Roth said that the company is on track to meet its goal of 2% to 3% organic revenue growth for the year.\nIPG is working with clients to prepare for General Data Protection Regulation -- a new set of privacy regulations known as GDPR set to go into effect in Europe in May that will change how consumer data can be collected and used.\n“When the time comes at the end of May we’ll be ready for it,” he said.“The ethics of our data and relationships with our clients, our consumers and third parties is a top priority for us,” he said. “We’re working very closely with our third-party providers, where a lot of these issues come into play. Clients [are] working with us to make sure they’re compliant as well.”\nMeanwhile, in the U.S., he said clients are not pulling back from Facebook following revelations that Cambridge Analytica, a data firm with ties to President Donald Trump, improperly accessed data on Facebook users. Among changes enacted in the wake of the controversy, Facebook said it would remove third-party data vendors from its platform, making it more difficult for brands to target specific audiences.\n“We’re working with Facebook to make sure third-party data has the appropriate permissions that are necessary,” said Mr. Roth. “As long as clients are using their own data on Facebook, that seems to be OK. There are ways to deal with this, and Facebook every day is coming out with new solutions. I think that ultimately we will all get this right.”\nIPG reported a net loss of $14.1 million, or 4 cents a share, compared with net income of $24.7 million, or 6 cents a share, a year earlier.\nExcluding losses related to the sale of certain non-strategic businesses during the quarter, IPG said it posted adjusted earnings of 3 cents a share. Analysts had expected adjusted earnings of 5 cents a share, according to FactSet.\nWrite to Alexandra Bruell at alexandra.bruell@wsj.com",
