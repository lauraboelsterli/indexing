    "text": "JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African miner Exxaro Resources ( EXXJ.J ) said on Wednesday it plans to dispose of its remaining stake in U.S. titanium products company Tronox ( TROX.N ) to fund capital commitments, repay debt and to distribute capital to shareholders.\nExxaro, which previously disposed of a stake worth $474 million, said in a statement it plans to further disinvest from its remaining 24 percent stake “in a thoughtful, efficient and staged process over time.”\nThe miner, which holds 28.7 million shares in Tronox, said its remaining stake is valued at around $476 million assuming a share price of $16.57 per share.\nExxaro, which mainly produces coal, completed its sale of 22.4 million shares in Tronox in October last year and paid a special dividend of 4.5 billion rand ($377 million) from its income reserves after selling the stake.\nReporting by Tanisha Heiberg; Editing by Alexander Smith\n ",
