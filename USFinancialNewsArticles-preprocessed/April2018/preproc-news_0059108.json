    "text": "Q1 Net Income Increased 8.7% Over Same Period Last Year\nTotal Net Loans Up 10.1% from Prior Year\nDIXON, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- First Northern Community Bancorp (the “Company”, OTCQB: FNRN), holding company for First Northern Bank (“First Northern” or the “Bank”), today reported net income of $2.7 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to net income of $2.5 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nTotal assets at March 31, 2018 were $1.2 billion, an increase of $37.6 million, or 3.2%, compared to March 31, 2017. Total deposits at March 31, 2018 were $1.1 billion, an increase of $32.1 million, or 3.0%, compared to March 31, 2017. During the same period, total net loans (including loans held-for-sale) increased $66.3 million, or 10.1%, to $721.0 million. The Company continued to be “well capitalized” under regulatory definitions, exceeding the 10% total risk-based capital ratio threshold at March 31, 2018.\nCommenting on the Company’s financial results, President & Chief Executive Officer Louise Walker stated, “We are very pleased with our strong core operating results posted for the first three months of 2018, which ended with net income at $2.7 million, an 8.7% increase over the first quarter of 2017. By growing the balance sheet and increasing the size of our quality loan portfolio, we have been able to report consistent gains in our net interest income. Net interest income was $10.5 million at March 31, 2018, a 12.9% increase over the same period last year. Non-interest income declined $1.0 million, or 36.6%, when compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the $1.2 million gain on the sale-leaseback of our Auburn Branch recognized in the first quarter of 2017 which was not repeated in 2018. Investment and brokerage income generated from our Wealth Management Division was a bright spot within non-interest income, posting a 12.6% increase over first quarter of 2017. Lastly, our effective tax rate declined from 38.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 to 28.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; this led to a decrease in our provision for income taxes of $0.5 million, or 31.0%, when compared to the same period last year.”\nFirst Northern Bank is an independent community bank that specializes in relationship banking.
