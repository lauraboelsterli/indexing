    "text": "FRANKFURT, April 4 (Reuters) - German sportscar maker Porsche has bought a minority stake in Tel Aviv-based start-up Anagog Ltd to expand its expertise in digital technology.\n“We are keen to work with new companies to continue developing new digital offerings and launch these solutions in the market quickly so that customers can start benefiting from them,” Thilo Koslowski, Managing Director of Porsche Digital GmbH, a unit of Volkswagen’s Porsche business, said in a statement on Wednesday.\nPorsche did not say how large the stake was that it bought, nor did it disclose financial details.\nAnagog has developed software that analyses user behaviour directly in the mobile phone, using sensors, and then predicts future scenarios on the basis of artificial intelligence.\nIn February, German carmaker Daimler and U.S. venture capital firm MizMaa Ventures took part in a round of financing for up Anagog.\nReporting by Maria Sheahan, editing by Louise Heavens\n ",
