    "text": "Gold prices fell on Tuesday as U.S. stock markets stabilised, easing fears of a deeper sell-off, and the dollar strengthened, making bullion more expensive for users of other currencies.\nGold had surged on Monday as falling U.S. share prices and fears of a global trade war pushed investors towards safer assets. But while European stock markets continued to fall, led by technology shares, Wall Street rose.\nSpot gold was down 0.5 percent at $1,334.59 an ounce after rising 1.3 percent on Monday. U.S. gold futures were 0.6 percent lower at $1,338.60 an ounce.\n\"It's a correction after yesterday's strong move,\" said Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch. \"There's a lack of conviction that prices will rise much further or can sustain levels of $1,350. Profit taking started here so we are back below $1,340.\"\nshow chapters Gold sees third positive quarter 21 Hours Ago | 00:43 Gold has struggled to break from a trading range of $1,310- $1,360 since the start of the year.\n\"It's going to take a significant trigger to push it beyond this range,\" said Danske Bank analyst Jens Pedersen.\nOne potential trigger is a trade dispute between the world's two largest economies, with the Trump administration expected this week to unveil a list of advanced technology Chinese imports targeted for U.S. tariffs after Beijing on Monday raised tariffs on 128 U.S. products.\nGold is often used as a safe place to park assets during times of financial or political uncertainty.\nFunds have raised their bets on higher prices, with the net long position on the Comex exchange rebounding from a three-month low. Speculative investors have room to expand their long positions further, which would help drive prices higher, analysts at Citi said in a note.\nHigher market volatility and rising tension between Washington and Beijing will likely hold gold above $1,300 throughout 2018, they said.\n\"We assign a 30 percent probability that gold prices can scale $1,400 an ounce this year.\" Momentum indicators suggested gold prices would rise, with technical Fibonacci support at $1,317.25 and resistance at $1,361.80, analysts at ScotiaMocatta said in a note.\nIn other precious metals, spot silver was down 1.2 percent at $16.41 an ounce after rising 1.8 percent in the previous session.\nPlatinum was 0.24 percent lower at $927.30 an ounce. Palladium was down 0.6 percent at $929.10 after touching $927.75, its lowest since Oct. 10.",
