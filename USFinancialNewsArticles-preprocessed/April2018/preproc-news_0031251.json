    "text": "April 17, 2018 / 10:43 AM / Updated 10 hours ago Britain to review its climate targets - government minister Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain will review its climate targets to see whether they need to be strengthened to fit with the aims of an international climate accord, Britain’s energy minister said on Tuesday. \n“We will be seeking the advice of the UK’s independent advisors, the Committee on Climate Change, on the implications of the Paris Agreement for the UK’s long-term emissions reduction targets,” Claire Perry said \nPerry is Britain’s minister for energy and clean growth and made the comments during a speech as part of this week’s Commonwealth heads of government meeting in London \nBritain has a legally binding target to cut emissions by 80 percent on 1990 levels by 2050 \nExperts have warned this will not be enough to put the country on a path to help limit a rise in global temperatures to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times, as agreed by more than 190 nations in Paris in 2015. \nBritain’s review of its targets will take place after the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issues a report later this year on the potential impact of global warming above 1.5 degrees, Perry said.
