    "text": "April 27, 2018 / 5:56 AM / Updated 14 minutes ago Daimler sees currency effects tempering Mercedes revenue growth Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ) said currency headwinds will dampen revenue growth at its Mercedes-Benz luxury vehicles division this year, after foreign exchange effects and the absence of one-off gains pushed the group’s first-quarter operating profit 12 percent lower. The Daimler logo is seen before the Daimler annual shareholder meeting in Berlin, Germany, April 5, 2018. REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke\nDaimler’s Chief Financial Officer Bodo Uebber said the company now expected a burden on earnings this year in excess of 1 billion euros tied to currency effects and the strong euro.\nGroup earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) dropped to 3.34 billion euros (2.90 billion pounds) in the three months through March, below analyst expectations.\nResults in the year-earlier quarter were boosted by the reversal of an impairment of Daimler’s equity investment in BAIC Motor Corp ( 1958.HK ) and the valuation of a stake in map maker HERE.\nThe return on sales at its Mercedes-Benz Cars division inched up to 9 percent in the first quarter, from 8.9 percent a year earlier, thanks to a 5 percent rise in car sales to 594,299 vehicles, the company’s best ever quarter for luxury sales.\nThe profitability of its luxury cars division was dented by higher expenses for revaluing the leasing portfolio in Germany, Daimler said.\nAlthough Mercedes-Benz expects to continue posting new sales records, revenue growth will be impacted going forward, the Stuttgart-based carmaker said.\n“At Mercedes-Benz Cars, the expected exchange rate developments and lifecycle effects will dampen the development of revenue, so the division is expected to post full-year revenue at the high level of 2017,” Daimler said.
