The build would include the liquefaction plant, export terminal and a 670 kilometer (416 mile) natural gas pipeline.\nIt is considered essential for Canadian gas producers, who have access to some of the richest gas fields in the world in Northern Alberta and British Columbia, but face depressed prices due to a glut of gas in North America.\n($1 = 1.2868 Canadian dollars)",
