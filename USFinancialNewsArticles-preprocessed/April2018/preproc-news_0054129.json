    "text": "MUNCIE, Ind., April 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- MutualFirst Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ: MFSF), the holding company of MutualBank (the \"Bank\"), announced today adjusted net income available to common shareholders, excluding $605,000 of one-time merger related expenses, for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $4.5 million, or $0.57 diluted earnings per common share. This compares to net income available to common shareholders for the same period in 2017 of $3.2 million, or $0.43 diluted earnings per common share. The adjusted net income for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 represents an annualized return on average assets of 1.05% and return on average tangible common equity of 11.90% compared to 0.82% and 9.23%, respectively, for the same period of last year.\nIncluding the one-time merger related expenses, net income available to common shareholders for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $4.0 million, or $0.50 diluted earnings per common share. Annualized return on average assets was 0.93% and return on average tangible common equity was 10.53% for the first quarter of 2018.\nOn February 28, 2018, MutualFirst Financial, Inc. closed its acquisition of Universal Bancorp and merged Universal's wholly owned subsidiary, BloomBank, into MutualFirst Financial's wholly owned subsidiary, MutualBank. At closing, this acquisition increased total assets by approximately $398 million, total investments by $88 million, total loans by $253 million and total deposits by $315 million. The initial goodwill generated by the acquisition was $22 million and a core deposit intangible of $4.5 million.\n\"We believe our expansion into central and southern Indiana, through this acquisition, allows us to continue the momentum we have created over the last several years,\" said David W. Heeter, President and CEO.\nBalance Sheet\nAssets increased $407 million as of March 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 primarily due to the acquisition of Universal. The gross loan portfolio increased by $269 million primarily due to acquiring a $253 million net loan portfolio in the first quarter of 2018. Organic loan growth of $16 million was primarily in commercial loans in the first quarter of 2018. The mix of loans in our portfolio as of March 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 shifted toward our desired strategic objective through the acquisition. Commercial loans increased to 45.2% compared to 40.3%, residential loans decreased to 40.7% compared to 43.3% and non-residential consumer loans decreased to 14.1% compared to 16.4%.\nDeposits increased by $338 million as of March 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase of $315 million in the acquisition. As of March 31, 2018, core deposits totaled $1.1 billion, or 70.4% of total deposits and certificates of deposit totaled $458 million, or 29.6% of total deposits. This is compared to a mix of core deposits of 69.1% and certificates of deposit of 30.9 % as of December 31, 2017.\nMr. Heeter commented, \"The acquisition of Universal met our strategic objectives by providing us an increase in commercial lending, a strong core deposit base and attractive new markets with growth potential.\"\nAllowance for loan losses increased to $12.5 million as of March 31, 2018 compared to $12.4 million as of December 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans as of March 31, 2018 was 211% compared to 236% as of December 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses to total loans as of March 31, 2018 was 0.86% compared to 1.05% as of December 31, 2017. Non-performing loans to total loans at March 31, 2018 were 0.41% compared to 0.44% at December 31, 2017. Non-performing assets to total assets were 0.39% at March 31, 2018 compared to 0.38% at December 31, 2017. Loans acquired from Universal in the first quarter of 2018 had an initial credit mark of $4.0 million.\nStockholders' equity was $191.1 million at March 31, 2018, an increase of $40.8 million from December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to $42.3 million of capital issued as part of the acquisition of Universal. Other increases included net income available to common shareholders of $4.0 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income of $4.0 million, due market value changes in the investment portfolio, and common stock cash dividends paid of $1.5 million during the first quarter of 2018. The Company's tangible book value per common share as of March 31, 2018 decreased to $18.92 compared to $20.08 as of December 31, 2017 and the tangible common equity ratio decreased to 8.25% as of March 31, 2018 compared to 9.35% as of December 31, 2017. These declines are primarily a result of the acquisition in the first quarter of 2018. MFSF's and the Bank's risk-based capital ratios remained in excess of \"well-capitalized\" levels as defined by all regulatory standards as of March 31, 2018.\nIncome Statement\nNet interest income before the provision for loan losses increased $1.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. The increase in net interest income was a result of an increase of $162.9 million in average interest earning assets, due to the acquisition in the first quarter 2018 and organic loan growth, and an increase of fourteen basis points in net interest margin to 3.35%.\nProvision for loan losses in the first quarter of 2018 was $450,000, a $250,000 increase from last year's comparable period. Provision for loan losses was calculated based on management's ongoing evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, which is partially attributable to an increasing loan portfolio and net charge offs of $300,000, or 0.09% of total average loans on an annualized basis, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to net charge offs of $200,000, or 0.07% of total average loans on an annualized basis, in the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-interest income for the first quarter of 2018 was $4.4 million, an increase of $311,000 compared to the first quarter of 2017. Increases in non-interest income included an increase of $164,000 in service fee income on deposit accounts aided by increases in interchange fee income along with increases due to the acquisition. An increase in other income was a result of $325,000 of death benefits received on bank-owned life insurance policies. This increase was partially offset by a $135,000 decrease in net gain on loan sales due to slower mortgage loan production and a $122,000 increase in losses on sale of repossessed assets, due to losses on one former commercial relationship.\nNon-interest expense increased $1.6 million when comparing the first quarter of 2018 with the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition in the first quarter of 2018. One-time merger related expenses, primarily in professional fees and other expenses, were $605,000 in the first quarter of 2018 with no similar activity in the same period of 2017.\nThe effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 12.7% compared to 24.2% in the same quarter of 2017. The reason for the decline was the reduction of the corporate tax rate to 21% and an increase in tax free income partially due to an increase in holdings of tax free municipal securities.\n\"We are off to a good start in 2018 and we believe that the enhancements in the first quarter will help continue the momentum that we have seen over the last several years. We believe our larger market presence, along with a strong Indiana economy, will provide us more opportunities as we continue to focus on increasing shareholder value,\" Mr. Heeter concluded.\nMutualFirst Financial, Inc. is the parent company of MutualBank, an Indiana-based financial institution since 1889.
