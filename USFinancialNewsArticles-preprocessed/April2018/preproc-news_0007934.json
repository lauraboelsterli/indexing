    "text": "EditorsNote: Adds Sixers playoff seeding, restores dropped word in ninth paragraph\nJJ Redick had 25 points and six assists and the Philadelphia 76ers stretched their winning streak to 12 games Wednesday night by topping the Detroit Pistons 115-108.\nPhiladelphia has its longest winning streak since 1990. It had a 12-game streak that year from Jan. 13 to Feb. 5.\nThe Sixers with four games to go are now tied with the Cleveland Cavaliers for the third seed in the Eastern Conference. Philadelphia hosts Cleveland on Friday night.\nThe Pistons saw their five-game winning streak snapped and were officially eliminated from playoff contention. They have qualified for the playoffs just once in the last nine seasons.\nRedick hit 10 of 13 from the field and 5 of 7 3-point attempts.\nMarco Belinelli contributed 19 points, four rebounds, two assists and three steals off the bench. Ben Simmons had 16 points, six rebounds and seven assists.\nErsan Ilyasova posted 13 points and 11 rebounds, and Robert Covington tossed in 12 points along with three steals and two blocks.\nPhiladelphia recorded 32 assists on 44 baskets. The Sixers have dished out 20 or more assists in 30 consecutive games, the third time in franchise history they’ve accomplished that feat. It’s also their 25th game this season with at least 30 assists. The Golden State Warriors are the only team with more such games (39) this season.\nBoth teams were missing key performers. Sixers center Joel Embiid remained sidelined by a concussion and orbital fracture, while power forward Dario Saric is recovering from an elbow infection. Pistons power forward Blake Griffin sat out for the third straight game with a bone bruise in his right ankle.\nAnthony Tolliver led Detroit with 25 points and Stanley Johnson had 19. Reggie Bullock added 15 points, Ish Smith had 14 and 12 assists, and Andre Drummond had 13 points and 15 rebounds.\nThe Sixers led by as many as 19 points en route to a 65-49 halftime advantage. Their starting backcourt of Simmons and Redick combined for 27 points and seven assists. Redick’s 13 first-quarter points tied his season high for any quarter.\nPhiladelphia’s lead remained in double digits until the final minute of the second half.\nJohnson scored 13 third-quarter points, but Detroit couldn’t make up any ground. The Sixers were up 88-71 heading into the fourth.\nPhiladelphia swept the four-game season series from the Pistons for the first time since 2000-01.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
