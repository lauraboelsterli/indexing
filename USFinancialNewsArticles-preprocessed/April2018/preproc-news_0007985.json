Swimming - Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games - Men's 400m Freestyle Final - Optus Aquatic Centre - Gold Coast, Australia - April 5, 2018. Mack Horton of Australia celebrates after winning a gold medal. REUTERS/David Gray \nThe 21-year-old had to chase down James Guy and Jack McLoughlin to win the title, pulling ahead in the final 100 meters to edge out compatriot McLoughlin and the Englishman to touch in three minutes, 43.76. \nHorton was the first Australian champion in the race, seen as one of the premier titles on the program, since retired swimming great Ian Thorpe at Manchester in 2002. \nAustralia had held a virtual mortgage on the Commonwealth title from 1970 until 2002, winning eight of the nine golds before Scotland’s David Carry (2006) and Canada’s Ryan Cochrane (2010, 2014) broke their stranglehold.
