    "text": "DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas (Bank) today reported net income of $41.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. In comparison, for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, the Bank reported net income of $31.4 million and $35.1 million, respectively.\nThe $10.3 million increase in net income from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018 was attributable to increases in the Bank's net interest income ($7.4 million) and non-interest income ($1.7 million) and a decrease in its non-interest expenses ($2.4 million), offset by an increase in its AHP assessment ($1.2 million).\nThe $6.6 million increase in net income for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to the first quarter of 2017, was attributable to an increase in the Bank's net interest income ($15.3 million), offset by a decrease in its non-interest income ($6.3 million) and increases in its non-interest expenses ($1.7 million) and its AHP assessment ($0.7 million).\nTotal assets at March 31, 2018 were $65.1 billion, compared with $68.5 billion at December 31, 2017. The $3.4 billion decrease in total assets for the first quarter was attributable primarily to a $2.9 billion decrease in the Bank's short-term liquidity portfolio and a $1.2 billion decrease in the Bank's advances, partially offset by a $0.6 billion increase in the Bank's long-term investments.\nAdvances totaled $35.3 billion at March 31, 2018, compared with $36.5 billion at December 31, 2017. The Bank's mortgage loans held for portfolio totaled $1.0 billion at March 31, 2018, as compared to $0.9 billion at December 31, 2017.\nThe Bank's long-term held-to-maturity securities portfolio, which is comprised substantially of U.S. agency residential mortgage-backed securities (MBS), totaled approximately $1.9 billion at both March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The Bank's long-term available-for-sale securities portfolio, which is comprised substantially of U.S. agency debentures and U.S. agency commercial MBS, totaled $15.0 billion at March 31, 2018 as compared to $14.4 billion at December 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Bank also held a $0.1 billion long-term U.S. Treasury Note classified as trading.\nThe Bank's short-term liquidity portfolio, which is comprised substantially of overnight federal funds sold and overnight reverse repurchase agreements, totaled $11.6 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $14.5 billion at December 31, 2017.\nThe Bank's retained earnings increased to $972 million at March 31, 2018 from $942 million at December 31, 2017. On March 28, 2018, a dividend of $11.1 million was paid to the Bank's shareholders.\nAdditional selected financial data as of and for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 (and, for comparative purposes, as of December 31, 2017 and for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017) is set forth below. Further discussion and analysis regarding the Bank's first quarter results will be included in its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAbout the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas\nThe Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas is one of 11 district banks in the FHLBank System, which was created by Congress in 1932.
