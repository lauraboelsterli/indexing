( BSGM ) a medical device company developing a proprietary biomedical signal processing platform designed to address an unmet technology need for the $4.6 billion electrophysiology (EP) marketplace, today announced that the Company has officially issued their 2018 letter to its shareholders providing them with updates on commercialization efforts, strategic relationships and enhancements to capital structure.\nRecent Company Highlights\nAnnounced the submission of its 510(k) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clearance of the company's PURE EP™ technology Management filed Form 4 documents announcing their insider stock purchases Raised nearly $9 million in equity for the company Reiterated goal to uplist to Nasdaq Stock Exchange\n“I believe that with all of the recent developments we have made and commercialization efforts now underway, now is the ideal time to provide an in-depth update to the investment community,” stated Mr. Kenneth Londoner, Founder, Chairman and CEO of BioSig Technologies. “In addition to formally submitting our 510(k) application with the FDA and making strategic hires to our commercialization team, we have strengthened both our balance sheet and industry relationships. Proof of managements’ optimism in the company can be seen from our numerous Form 4 filings, announcing significant insider stock purchases from our team. I am confident that the strides we have made over the last several months will allow us to uplist to a more senior exchange in the near future, as we remain focused on our principal objective, increasing shareholder value.”\nTo view BioSig Technologies’ Shareholder Letter please visit: Link to Letter\nAbout BioSig Technologies\nBioSig Technologies is a medical device company developing a proprietary biomedical signal processing technology designed to improve the $4.6 billion electrophysiology (EP) marketplace ( www.biosigtech.com ).
