    "text": "LOS ANGELES, April 04, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE -- Global Payout Inc. (OTCPink:GOHE) (\"Global\") is pleased to announce that executives Stephen Russell (CEO) and Bill Rochfort (President) of its newly formed supply chain finance subsidiary, SecurCapital Corp , have joined the Advisory Board of BrickEX, serving as advisors to the ICO founding team.\nBrickEX is an open, decentralized, real estate crypto exchange that will target the $217 trillion global real estate market where only 1% of assets are currently traded. BrickEX aggregates real estate on-line by giving access to 3rd party real estate owners so that every owner can list and exchange their real estate asset. Using blockchain, BrickEX tokens, and smart contracts, the platform provides a market among providers and investors (institutional and crowdsourcing) for access to liquidity.\n\"The BrickEX leadership team has already demonstrated blockchain and crypto success in the fine arts market,\" said CEO, Steve Russell. \"No doubt, BrickEX will be the largest real estate ICO in a growing industry.\" Added President, Bill Rochfort, \"SecurCapital will benefit with all the tangible operating similarities between the global real estate industry and global logistics market. In fact, logistics is one of the largest industries for real estate holdings.\" SecurCapital provides its commercial, government contractors and logistics clients multiple suites of financial services including securitized factoring, FX, international payments and M&A services.\nThe SecurCloud Platform (\"SCP\"), which the Company has developed through the technology available in its Consolidated Payment Gateway (\"CPG\"), is a fully configurable, \"banking-in-a-box\" cloud-based platform. The overall design is a \"closed proprietary ecosystem\" (e.g.., intranet) so that each client has maximum control and security over any internal employees, partners, vendors, and contractors for bilateral payments and improved security.\nAbout Global Payout, Inc. (OTC Pink:GOHE)\nSince the Company's inception in 2009, Global Payout, Inc. has been a leading provider of comprehensive and customized prepaid payment solutions for domestic and international organizations distributing money worldwide. In 2014, Global introduced its first online payment platform called the Consolidated Payment Gateway (CPG), which allowed its enterprise clients to transfer money to international bank accounts, mobile accounts, and prepaid card accounts. The development of the CPG became the foundation for the introduction of its new, state of the art FINTECH payment system in 2017, for both online and mobile applications to allow account holders to maximize an expanded suite of financial services and minimize operational costs. Global will continue to offer their FINTECH payment system to many vertical markets for support of foreign currency exchange and digital currency, including ongoing support of the banking industry and international governments.\nAbout SecurCapital Corporation\nSecurCapital is a Fintech supply chain finance company offering premier payment and working capital solutions for the logistics industry. The SecurCloud Platform ('SCP') provides an integrated system for global payments, foreign exchange, and accounts receivable financing services through a proprietary ecosystem controlled by the client. The dashboard user environment allows the client to optimize cash flow management through document delivery of invoices, proof of delivery, and payment transactions to global vendors.\nForward-Looking Statements Disclaimer:\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
