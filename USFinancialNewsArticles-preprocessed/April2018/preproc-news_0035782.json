    "text": "April 18, 2018 / 12:41 AM / Updated an hour ago Global stocks near four-week highs, supported by corporate earnings Saqib Iqbal Ahmed 4 Min Read \nNEW YORK (Reuters) - World equity markets climbed to approach a four-week high on Wednesday, as investors’ appetite for the riskier asset was boosted by upbeat earnings from companies in Europe and the United States. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in the borough of New York City, New York, U.S., April 17, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid \nThe U.S. dollar clung to gains amid fading concerns over a global trade war, while a reported decline in U.S. crude inventories and the possibility of supply disruptions pushed oil prices higher. \nMSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe was up 0.56 percent, the highest since March 21, and on track for a third straight session of gains. \nThe index was supported by a higher open on Wall Street on Wednesday, following the latest batch of earnings. Morgan Stanley shares rose 3 percent after the bank reported a 40 percent jump in quarterly profit, driven by its trading business. \n“Earnings continue to progress on the positive side and commodities are also on the rise, that should give the markets another boost,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. \nInvestors appeared to be focusing on fundamentals after weeks dominated by geopolitical tensions. \n“The safety trade that we have experienced seems to have ended,” said Cardillo. \nShares of International Business Machines Corp tumbled 7.3 percent after its profit margins fell short of Wall Street expectations. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 12.93 points, or 0.05 percent, to 24,799.56, the S&P 500 gained 9.17 points, or 0.34 percent, to 2,715.56 and the Nasdaq Composite added 25.05 points, or 0.34 percent, to 7,306.15. \nEuropean shares firmed amid strong company results, including those from French food group Danone, private healthcare provider Mediclinic and Dutch oil and chemical storage company Vopak. The German share price index, DAX board, is seen at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, March 21, 2018. REUTERS/Tilman Blasshofer \nEurope’s broad FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 0.32 percent at 1,496.62. \nThe U.S. dollar held steady versus a basket of major currencies as solid company results and fading concerns about a trade war helped keep a lid on safe-haven demand for the greenback. \nThe dollar found support from relatively stronger economic data than those seen in Europe and other developed markets. \nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was 0.07 percent higher at 89.58. \nTrading across U.S. government bond maturities was range-bound on Wednesday, with yields little changed in spite of gains in the equity market. \n“The reaction in the bond market seems to be a lot more muted relative to the big moves we’ve seen in the equities rally in the past few sessions. Generally, the bond market seems to be under-reacting to both the sell-off and the rally,” said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale in New York. \nThe U.S. 10-year note was down 9/32 in price to yield 2.8469 percent, up from a yield of 2.814 percent on Tuesday. \nOil extended gains, rising more than $1 on a reported decline in U.S. crude inventories and after sources signaled top exporter Saudi Arabia wants to see the crude price closer to $100 a barrel. \nBrent crude oil futures were 1.9 percent higher at $72.95 a barrel, while U.S. WTI crude futures were up 2.2 percent at $68.06. \nGold prices rose to a one-week high on technical trading and as the dollar held steady. Spot gold was up 0.3 percent at $1,351.01 an ounce. Additional reporting by Kate Duguid in NEW YORK, Sruthi Shankar in BENGALURU; Editing by Bernadette Baum",
