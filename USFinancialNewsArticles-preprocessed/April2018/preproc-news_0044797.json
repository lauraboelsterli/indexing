    "text": "April 22, 2018 / 3:41 AM / Updated 8 hours ago Soccer: Barcelona thrash Sevilla to win King's Cup again Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \nMADRID (Reuters) - Unstoppable duo Andres Iniesta and Lionel Messi helped Barcelona thrash Sevilla 5-0 to win the King’s Cup final for the fourth consecutive season on Saturday as they close in on a likely domestic double. \nLuis Suarez struck twice in the first half for the Catalans as they won the competition for a record 30th time. However, it was Iniesta and Messi who pulled all the strings as the La Liga leaders blew away Vincenzo Montella’s stunned side. \nPhilippe Coutinho set up Suarez for the opening goal in the 14th minute and Barcelona dominated the rest of the game. The result goes some way to make up for their humiliating Champions League quarter-final elimination by AS Roma earlier in April. \nMessi slammed home the second after good work from Jordi Alba with Suarez adding another, before Iniesta netted from a tight angle. Coutinho added a fifth from the penalty spot to complete the rout. \n“This doesn’t cover up what happened in Rome but it’s an important title,” said Suarez. \n“At the start of the season we would have taken this, there’s huge merit to it. \n“It’s strange to be knocked out of the Champions League, we gave the impression that we could go far in it.” \nBoth Barcelona and Sevilla fans sang Iniesta’s name when he was substituted in the final stages, with the chants echoing around the Wanda Metropolitano stadium until after the final whistle.

We are not in our best form, we have to react.” \nWith Iniesta leading the way, Barca came flying out of the blocks and moved ahead after a long ball from goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen found Coutinho deep in opposition territory and he set up Suarez. \nSevilla rallied but after a couple of half-chances Barcelona doubled their lead when Iniesta sent Alba flying down the left. The Spaniard backheeled the ball into Messi’s path and the Argentine fired in.
