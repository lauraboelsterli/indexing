    "text": "April 20, 2018 / 4:28 AM / Updated an hour ago Japan insurer Aioi Nissay eyes alternative assets, foreign equities Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nTOKYO, April 20 (Reuters) - Japan’s Aioi Nissay Dowa Insurance is considering investing in alternative assets and foreign stocks for the fiscal year through March 2019 as it looks to diversify its portfolio, a senior official said on Friday. \nFaced with low domestic yields, which have been driven down by the central bank’s extensive monetary easing, Japanese institutional investors have increasingly sought better returns abroad and away from assets such as government bonds. \nThe insurer has assets of around 3.5 trillion yen ($32.5 billion).
