    "text": "PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh today announced unaudited financial results for the first quarter of 2018. The Bank recorded net income of $78.9 million, and the Board of Directors declared dividends of 6.75 percent annualized on activity stock and 3.50 percent annualized on membership stock. Dividends are payable to the Bank’s stockholders on April 27, 2018.\n“First quarter results show another strong quarter for our cooperative,” said Winthrop Watson, president and chief executive officer. “Our continuing strength reflects the Bank’s relevance to our membership.”\nHighlights for first quarter of 2018 include:\nNet income of $78.9 million Net interest income of $109.6 million Advances at $70.3 billion Letters of credit at $18.8 billion Retained earnings at $1.2 billion\nOperating Results\nThe Bank’s net income totaled $78.9 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $86.8 million for the first quarter of 2017. This $7.9 million decrease was driven by lower total noninterest income, partially offset by lower total other expense. Net interest income was relatively flat in the comparison.\nNet interest income was $109.6 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $108.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. Interest income included higher interest income on advances, Federal funds sold, investment securities and mortgage loans held for portfolio. The offsetting interest expense was primarily related to consolidated obligations. Noninterest income in the first quarter of 2018 was $1.7 million, down $11.0 million compared to $12.7 million in the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to net losses on trading securities of $8.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $2.3 million in net gains in the same period in 2017. Total other expense decreased $3.3 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to lower compensation and benefits expenses.\nFirst quarter 2018 performance allowed the Bank to set aside $8.8 million for affordable housing programs.\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nAt March 31, 2018, total assets were $93.4 billion, compared with $99.7 billion at December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in advances, which totaled $70.3 billion at March 31, 2018 compared to $74.3 billion at year-end 2017.\nTotal capital at March 31, 2018, was $4.8 billion, compared to $4.9 billion at December 31, 2017. Total retained earnings at March 31, 2018, were $1.2 billion, relatively unchanged from year-end 2017. Total retained earnings at March 31, 2018 included $298.2 million of restricted retained earnings compared with $282.5 million of restricted retained earnings at December 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, FHLBank Pittsburgh had total regulatory capital of $4.7 billion and remained in compliance with all regulatory capital requirements.\nThe Board of Directors declared a dividend on subclass B2 (activity) stock equal to an annual yield of 6.75 percent and a dividend on subclass B1 (membership) stock equal to an annual yield of 3.50 percent. These dividends will be calculated on stockholders’ average balances during the period January 1, 2018, to March 31, 2018, and credited to stockholders’ accounts on Friday, April 27, 2018.\nDetailed financial information regarding first quarter 2018 results will be available in FHLBank Pittsburgh’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which the Bank anticipates filing on May 8, 2018.\nAbout FHLBank Pittsburgh\nAs an intermediary between global capital markets and local lenders, FHLBank Pittsburgh provides readily available liquidity, as well as affordable housing and community development opportunities, to member financial institutions of all sizes in Delaware, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
