    "text": "April 25, 2018 / 2:11 PM / in 4 minutes U.S. sanctions encourage McDonald's to cook up Russian fries Maria Kiselyova 3 Min Read\nLIPETSK, Russia (Reuters) - French fries at McDonald’s restaurants from Moscow to Murmansk will be Russian from now on, as U.S. sanctions have spurred on a shift by the American fast-food chain to use local potatoes. People enter a McDonald's restaurant in Moscow, Russia April 24, 2018. Picture taken April 24, 2018. REUTERS/Tatyana Makeyeva\nMcDonald’s Corp ( MCD.N ), which opened in Russia in 1990 as the Soviet Union collapsed, has turned to Russian ingredients for everything from Big Macs to chicken burgers.\nBut till now it relied on frozen French fries from the Netherlands and Poland as Russian spuds weren’t quite right.\n“There was no potato which would suit us in terms of quality - color, taste, size – these are all the details that are important for us,” Khamzat Khasbulatov, chairman of McDonald’s Russia, told Reuters.\nBut swings in the oil price and sanctions by the United States and other Western nations - imposed over Moscow’s annexation of Crimea and other rows - have hit the rouble and led to trade restrictions, causing a headache for any business in Russia that imports or exports goods.

But Western trade restrictions remain in place.\nRussia’s response to punitive measures has included a 2014 ban on a range of Western food imports.\n“Sanctions as well as counter sanctions not only affect our company but the whole industry and the economy,” said Khasbulatov, whose firm has 50,000 Russian employees and more than 160 domestic suppliers.\n“But in any case we continue our development, continue to build new restaurants and modernize existing ones,” he said, adding that firm opened 41 restaurants in Russia in 2017.
