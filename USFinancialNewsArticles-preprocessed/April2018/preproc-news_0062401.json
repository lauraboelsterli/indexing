    "text": "KABUL (Reuters) - A journalist who worked for a local Afghan language service of the BBC and also contributed to Reuters was shot dead while driving home in the eastern city of Khost on Monday, officials said.\nAhmad Shah, who worked for the BBC’s Pashto language service as well as for Reuters, was killed in the Gulzar area on the outskirts of Khost, according to Talib Mangal, spokesman for Khost’s provincial governor.\nThe BBC confirmed the death in a statement on Twitter.\nThe attack came on the same day that nine journalists were killed in a suicide attack in Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital, and a week after unknown gunmen killed an Afghan journalist in the southern city of Kandahar.\nThere was no indication of any direct link between the attacks.\nReporting by Rupam Jain; Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ",
