    "text": "SAN DIEGO, April 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- PriceSmart, Inc. (NASDAQ: PSMT) today announced its results of operations for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 which ended on February 28, 2018.\nFor the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, net warehouse club sales increased 5.7% to $816.6 million from $772.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. Total revenues for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 were $839.6 million compared to $793.3 million in the comparable period of the prior year. The Company had 40 warehouse clubs in operation as of February 2018 and 39 clubs in operation as of February 2017.\nThe Company recorded operating income during the quarter of $37.3 million, as compared to $39.4 million in the prior year. Operating income in the current period included the impact of a $2.6 million charge associated with the Company ending its internal on-line platform development as a result of the acquisition of Aeropost, Inc., and $525,000 in deal costs associated with the acquisition.\nNet income was $14.1 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 as compared to $27.2 million, or $0.90 per diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. The Company's results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 reflect the effect of U.S. Tax Reform. We have made a provisional estimate of the one-time transitional repatriation tax on unremitted foreign earnings (\"Transition Tax\") of approximately $13.4 million that was recorded as an income tax expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, and a non-cash income tax charge of approximately $822,000 related to the re-measurement of certain U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the reduction in U.S. corporate income tax rates from 35% to 21%. The resulting net impact to earnings in the quarter related to U.S. Tax Reform, including the new beneficial 21% tax rate on current earnings, was approximately $0.42 per share.\nFor the first six months of fiscal year 2018, net warehouse club sales increased 4.9% to $1,562.0 million from $1,488.4 million in the first six months of fiscal year 2017. Total revenues for the first half of fiscal year 2018 increased 4.8% to $1,606.6 million from $1,532.9 million in the same period of the prior year. For the first six months of fiscal year 2018, the Company recorded operating income of $70.4 million and net income of $36.6 million, or $1.21 per diluted share. During the same six month period in fiscal year 2017, the Company recorded operating income of $77.8 million and net income of $52.1 million, or $1.72 per diluted share.\nPriceSmart management plans to host a conference call at 12:00 p.m. Eastern time (9:00 a.m. Pacific time) on Friday, April 6, 2018, to discuss the financial results. Individuals interested in participating in the conference call may do so by dialing (855) 209-8211 for domestic callers or (412) 317-5214 for international callers, and asking to join the PriceSmart, Inc. call.
