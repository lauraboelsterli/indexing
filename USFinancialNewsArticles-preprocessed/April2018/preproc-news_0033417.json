    "text": "ANKARA (Reuters) - Expected changes to the Turkish constitution will be fully implemented with the presidential elections scheduled for November 2019, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday, in an apparent response to a suggestion for early polls.\nErdoganâ€™s comments came after the head of the nationalist MHP party suggested holding presidential elections in August this year.\nTurks narrowly backed a constitutional change last year to change the constitution and grant Erdogan sweeping powers. The changes are due to become effective in the next elections.\nReporting by Ercan Gurses; Writing by Ezgi Erkoyun; Editing by David Dolan\n ",
