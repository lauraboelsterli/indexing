Workers watch as an excavator clears the debris at the site after a four-story hotel collapsed in a crowded part of the central Indian city of Indore late on Saturday, in this still image taken from video released on April 1, 2018. ANI/via REUTERS TV \nRescue operations were complete and no other casualties were likely, assistant sub-inspector Ramesh Kirade told Reuters by telephone. \nWhile the building was old, the reason for its collapse was not immediately known, Kirade said. Slideshow (2 Images) \nAccording to local news reports, the building collapsed after a heavy vehicle rammed into it. \nBuilding collapses are common in India, where unscrupulous builders and officials often dodge regulations or overlook the need to renovate old structures. \nIn August, a 117-year-old building collapsed in the financial hub of Mumbai killing at least 22 people.
