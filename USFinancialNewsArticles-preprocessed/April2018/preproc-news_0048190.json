    "text": "FAIRFAX, Va., April 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- MainStreet Bancshares, Inc. (OTCQX: MNSB), the holding company for MainStreet Bank, reports net income of $1.69 million for the first quarter of 2018, which is 64% higher than first quarter 2017 net income of $1.03 million. Earnings per share for the first quarter 2017 were $0.30 versus $0.24 for first quarter 2017.\nNet interest income of $6.78 million for the first quarter of 2018 exceeds the first quarter of 2017 by $2.05 million. The first quarter 2018 net interest margin fell four basis points to 3.57% against the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-interest income excluding securities gains is down 21% for first quarter 2018 versus 2017 for two key reasons: 1) a decline in mortgage originations for the first quarter of 2018, and 2) a sizeable loan prepayment penalty earned in the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-interest expense for the first quarter of 2018 is $4.6 million compared to $3.7 million for the first quarter of 2017. This is primarily due to an increase in employees and salaries in support of balance sheet growth. The efficiency ratio improved to 62.9% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 69.4% for first quarter 2017.\nMainStreet Bancshares's balance sheet grew 48% to $844 million for first quarter 2018 versus first quarter 2017. Net loans at March 31, 2018 total $703 million against net loans outstanding at March 31, 2018 of $462 million, an increase of 52%. Asset quality remains very strong with nonperforming loans at 0.27% of total gross loans on March 31, 2018.\nNon-interest-bearing deposits increased to $165 million as of March 31, 2018, a 45% increase from March 31, 2017. Non-interest-bearing deposits represent 24% of total deposits at March 31, 2018. Total deposits as of March 31, 2018 were $691 million an increase of $227 million from March 31, 2017.\nThe book value per common share is $12.75 as of March 31, 2018. According to OTC Markets, the share price closed the quarter at $20.95 per common share, or 164% of book value. During the first quarter there were 362 trades for a total volume of 228,161 common shares totaling $4.3 million.\nQuote: S: \"2018 is off to a good start,\" says Jeff W.
