Scholar Rock is creating a pipeline of novel product candidates with the potential to transform the lives of patients suffering from a wide range of serious diseases, including neuromuscular disorders, cancer, fibrosis and anemia. Scholar Rock’s newly elucidated understanding of the molecular mechanisms of growth factor activation enabled it to develop a proprietary platform for the discovery and development of monoclonal antibodies that locally and selectively target these signaling proteins at the cellular level. By developing product candidates that act in the disease microenvironment, the company intends to avoid the historical challenges associated with safely and effectively inhibiting growth factors for therapeutic effect. Scholar Rock is focused on biologically validated growth factors to aim for a more efficient development path.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nVarious statements in this release concerning Scholar Rock’s future expectations, plans and prospects, including without limitation, its expectations regarding the contributions of any member of its management team, including such member’s ability to affect Scholar Rock’s development or growth plans, constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
