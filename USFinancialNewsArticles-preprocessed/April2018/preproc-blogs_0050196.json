For years, Alphabet Inc.’s YouTube has bragged to marketers that its laissez-faire attitude toward video creators was a feature, not a bug. Over the past year, the platform has made the most sweeping changes since its early days, removing videos it deemed inappropriate and stripping away the advertising from others. But to date, both YouTube and its parent company have struggled to articulate how their plan will make things better, Bloomberg Businessweek reports.\nNBC bet $69 million on Megyn Kelly, then viewers vanished. Megyn Kelly was supposed to bring star power to NBC News and a bigger, broader audience of morning viewers to its “Today” show franchise. Instead, the three-year, $69 million bet to woo Ms. Kelly from her conservative prime-time perch at Fox News is backfiring.\nViolent rivals rush into FARC void in Colombia. Despite government efforts to bring order to Colombia, police and military forces are now struggling against various armed groups vying for land and illegal activities once controlled by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, Reuters reports.\nShare this: the weekend reader Previous CFO Moves: Papa John's, The New York Times ",
