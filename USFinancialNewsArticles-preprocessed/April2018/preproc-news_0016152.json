    "text": "Aaron Gordon poured in 20 points and six Orlando players scored in double figures as the Magic led throughout during a 105-100 win over the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday at the Amway Center in Orlando in a game between NBA also-rans.\nBoth the Mavericks (24-55) and the Magic (24-54) have been eliminated from playoff consideration.\nThe Mavericks trailed for all but the first three minutes of the game but fought back to within 97-96 on an Aaron Harrison 3-pointer with 2:58 to play. Mario Hezonja immediately answered with a jumper and Khem Birch followed with another bucket to increase the Magic’s advantage to 101-96 with 1:09 left.\nKyle Collinsworth’s jumper cut the lead to 101-98 before Birch hit two more free throws with 22.9 seconds remaining to give the Magic a five-point cushion. Hezonja and Shelvin Mack added free throws in the final 13.9 seconds to cement the win.\nJamel Artis added 18 points for Orlando, which has won two straight. Mack scored 13 points, Hezonja and Bismack Biyombo hit for 12 points each, and Birch tallied 10 for the Magic. Biyombo led all players with 12 rebounds.\nJalen Jones led Dallas with 15 points, and Doran Finney-Smith, Johnathan Motley and Collinsworth each scored 14 points for the Mavericks. Aaron Harrison added 13 points and Maxi Kleber hit for 12 for Dallas.\nDallas played without usual starting forwards Dirk Nowitzki, Harrison Barnes, and Wesley Matthews, and point guard Dennis Smith Jr. while Orlando starting forward Evan Fournier and guard Jonathan Simmons were inactive.\nThe Magic led by as many as 14 points in the first half before settling for a 56-51 advantage at intermission. Gordon paced all scorers in the first two quarters with 18 points; Biyombo added 12 points (on 4 of 4 shooting from the floor) and 10 rebounds, and Atris hit for 10 points off the bench in the first half for Orlando.\nDallas was led by reserve Jalen Jones’ 11 points and Kleber’s 9 points.\nThe Magic were up by eight points twice in the third quarter only to see Dallas pull to within 77-74 at the end of the period.\nThe Magic remain at home for a game Friday against Charlotte; Dallas heads to Detroit to play the Pistons, also on Friday.\n— Field Level Media\n ",
