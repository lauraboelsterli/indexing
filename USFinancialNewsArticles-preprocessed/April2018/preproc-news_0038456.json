It’s going to be a day where the market is going to attempt to move a bit higher.”\nHealthcare stocks rose 0.76 percent on the S&P 500, driven by Merck’s 3.2 percent rise following positive data on its immunotherapy, Keytruda.\nShares of Bank of America edged lower despite the lender reporting a better-than-expected increase in quarterly profit.\nAnalysts are expecting the S&P 500 companies to record an 18.6 percent rise in profit, their strongest earnings growth in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nHowever, many traders say that reactions to results could be muted as market participants have already priced in gains from corporate tax cuts, reflected in the stock market’s strong rally in 2017 and early 2018.\nAt 9:53 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.59 percent at 24,502.89. The S&P 500 gained 0.41 percent to 2,667.22 and the Nasdaq Composite 0.19 percent higher at 7,120.19.\nWaning fears of a broader conflict in Syria pushed short-dated U.S. Treasury yields to their highest level in almost a decade, while crude oil prices eased due to a rise in U.S. drilling activity.\n“We’re seeing a little bit of an uptick in yields and pullback in oil, and those are likely to constrain any strong reaction to earnings and macro news,” said Cardillo.\nData on Monday showed U.S. retail sales increased more than expected in March, rising after three straight monthly declines, as households boosted purchases of motor vehicles and other big-ticket items.\nShares of optical component makers Acacia Communications , Oclaro, Lumentum Holdings Inc and Finisar Corp were down between 4.2 percent and 33 percent.\nReuters reported that the U.S. Department of Commerce was banning American companies from selling components to Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp for seven years for violating the terms of a sanctions violation case.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE for a 2.22-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, a 1.35-to-1 ratio favored advancers. (Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D’Silva)\n ",
