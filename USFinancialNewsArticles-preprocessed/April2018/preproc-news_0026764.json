FILE PHOTO: American Express logo and trading symbol are displayed on a screen at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, NY, U.S., December 6, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo \nShares of New York-based AmEx rose 3 percent in after-market trading on Wednesday. \nAmEx said card member spending rose 3 percent in the United States and 7 percent worldwide in the first three months of 2018. \nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose in January and February. \nAmEx said net income attributable to common shareholders rose to $1.63 billion or $1.86 per share in the first quarter ended March 31, from $1.25 billion or $1.35 per share a year earlier. \nAnalysts on average had expected earnings of $1.71 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nTotal revenue, net of interest expense, climbed 12 percent to $9.72 billion, topping analysts’ expectations of $9.46 billion.
