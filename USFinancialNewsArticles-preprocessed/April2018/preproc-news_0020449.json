    "text": "THE WOODLANDS, Texas, April 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Layne Christensen Company (NASDAQ: LAYN) (\"Layne\" or the \"Company\") today announced financial and operating results for the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter (Q4 FY 2018) ended January 31, 2018 and the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 (FY 2018).\nQ4 FY 2018 Financial Highlights\nReported net income from continuing operations for Q4 FY 2018 was $2.7 million, or $0.14 per share, compared to net loss of ($29.2) million, or ($1.47) per share, for the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter (Q4 FY 2017) ended January 31, 2017. Net income was improved during the quarter by $10.4 million in tax benefits primarily related to reversal of accrued foreign taxes recorded in prior years. Total Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure as defined below) increased to $5.5 million in Q4 FY 2018 compared to ($4.2) million in Q4 FY 2017. Unallocated corporate expenses reflected in Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $5.2 million in Q4 FY 2018 compared to $5.6 million in Q4 FY 2017. The decrease primarily reflects reductions in legal, professional and consulting fees. As of January 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents were $32.0 million, and total debt was $166.1 million. Total liquidity, which includes availability under Layne's credit facility and total cash and cash equivalents, was $107.5 million at January 31, 2018, compared to $101.6 million at October 31, 2017. Total backlog was $178.6 million at January 31, 2018 compared to $172.1 million at October 31, 2017 and $166.6 million at January 31, 2017. On February 13, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement whereby Granite Construction Incorporated will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Layne with each Layne stockholder receiving 0.27 shares of Granite stock for each share of Layne stock. The transaction, which is expected to close in the second calendar quarter of 2018, is subject to the approval of Layne's stockholders and other customary closing conditions.\nFY 2018 Financial Highlights\nReported net loss from continuing operations for FY 2018 was ($4.9) million, or ($0.24) per share, compared to ($47.0) million, or ($2.38) per share for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2017 (FY 2017). Total Adjusted EBITDA increased to $35.0 million in FY 2018 compared to $14.4 million in FY 2017. Unallocated corporate expenses reflected in Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $20.3 million in FY 2018 compared to $23.8 million in FY 2017. The improvement was primarily due to reductions in legal, professional and consulting fees, partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation expense due to our improved performance.\nCEO Commentary\nMichael J. Caliel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Layne, commented, \"The fourth quarter was a busy and productive time for Layne. In the coming quarter, we will continue to execute on our business plan and take definitive steps towards a timely closing of the Granite merger transaction. By merging with Granite, Layne's stockholders will meaningfully share in the upside opportunities of a combined company with substantially greater financial resources to invest in growth initiatives and a more diversified, expanded national platform of businesses that is expected to be positioned as a leader across both the transportation and water infrastructure markets.\"\nLAYNE CHRISTENSEN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA\nThree Months\nFiscal Year\nEnded January 31,\nEnded January 31,\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nRevenues\n$\n110,427\n$\n99,928\n$\n475,517\n$\n464,783\nCost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below)\n(89,469)\n(87,441)\n(374,761)\n(382,101)\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below)\n(18,445)\n(19,348)\n(74,428)\n(76,586)\nDepreciation and amortization\n(7,023)\n(6,300)\n(26,701)\n(25,302)\nGains on sale of fixed assets\n1,828\n1,058\n3,741\n3,886\nEquity in earnings of affiliates\n338\n739\n3,431\n2,655\nRestructuring costs\n(2,695)\n(14,148)\n(4,903)\n(16,924)\nInterest expense\n(4,375)\n(4,222)\n(17,120)\n(16,883)\nOther (expense) income, net\n(11)\n178\n(15)\n843\nLoss from continuing operations before income taxes\n(9,425)\n(29,556)\n(15,239)\n(45,629)\nIncome tax benefit (expense)\n12,118\n404\n10,375\n(1,420)\nNet income (loss) from continuing operations\n2,693\n(29,152)\n(4,864)\n(47,049)\nLoss from discontinued operations\n(118)\n(3,928)\n(22,447)\n(5,187)\nNet income (loss)\n$\n2,575\n$\n(33,080)\n$\n(27,311)\n$\n(52,236)\nEarnings (loss) per share information:\nBasic earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations\n$\n0.14\n$\n(1.47)\n$\n(0.24)\n$\n(2.38)\nBasic loss per share from discontinued operations\n(0.01)\n(0.20)\n(1.13)\n(0.26)\nBasic earnings (loss) per share\n$\n0.13\n$\n(1.67)\n$\n(1.37)\n$\n(2.64)\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations\n$\n0.13\n$\n(1.47)\n$\n(0.24)\n$\n(2.38)\nDiluted loss per share from discontinued operations\n(0.01)\n(0.20)\n(1.13)\n(0.26)\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share\n$\n0.12\n$\n(1.67)\n$\n(1.37)\n$\n(2.64)\nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic\n19,894\n19,791\n19,858\n19,786\nWeighted average shares outstanding - dilutive\n21,494\n19,791\n19,858\n19,786\nAs of\nJanuary 31,\nJanuary 31,\n(in thousands)\n2018\n2017\nBalance Sheet Data\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n32,041\n$\n69,000\nWorking capital (1)\n(4,709)\n105,545\nAdjusted Working Capital (excluding cash and cash equivalents)\n(36,750)\n36,545\nTotal assets\n370,189\n436,151\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt (1)\n67,293\n9\nTotal debt\n166,062\n162,355\nTotal Layne Christensen Company equity\n57,505\n82,220\nCommon shares issued and outstanding\n19,917\n19,805\n(1) As of January 31, 2018, amounts include Layne's 4.25% Convertible Notes with a maturity date of November 15, 2018.\nSummary of Operating Segment Data\nThe following are revenues and Adjusted EBITDA for Layne's operating segments.

The increase in revenues was partially offset by decreased revenues in agricultural drilling projects in the western and mid-western U.S. stemming from increased precipitation in the region. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 FY 2018 improved with reduced job losses from injection well and other drilling projects.\nFor FY 2018, revenues decreased 15.7% primarily due to a decrease in agricultural drilling projects related to increased precipitation in the western and mid-western U.S. over the past two years. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA during FY 2018 primarily reflects better performance on projects and fewer project execution issues.\nBacklog was $47.9 million at January 31, 2018 compared to $63.4 million at October 31, 2017 and $49.2 million at January 31, 2017.\nInliner\nRevenues for Inliner increased 8.9% during Q4 FY 2018 compared to the prior year period due to increased business, utilizing more subcontracted work and an increase in large diameter pipe jobs. The Q4 FY 2018 increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the revenue increase, partially offset by margin pressure from certain jobs while the prior year period included favorable margins on a number of jobs.\nRevenues for Inliner increased by 4.6% during FY 2018 due to an increase in business primarily in the Midwest and an increase in large diameter pipe jobs. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA during FY 2018 was driven primarily by the revenue increase compared to the prior year.\nBacklog was $130.7 million at January 31, 2018 compared to $108.7 million at October 31, 2017 and $117.4 million at January 31, 2017.\nMineral Services\nRevenues for Mineral Services increased by 16.7% for Q4 FY 2018 compared to the prior year period due to increased drilling activity related to the minerals market recovery, primarily in the western U.S. and Mexico. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 FY 2018 was essentially flat with the prior year period.\nRevenues for Mineral Services increased by 52.5% during FY 2018 due to increased market activity, primarily in the western U.S. and Mexico. Adjusted EBITDA more than doubled during FY 2018 primarily due to increased activity and profitability in the western U.S. and Mexico compared to the prior year.\nUnallocated Corporate Expenses\nUnallocated corporate expenses reflected in Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 6.5% for Q4 FY 2018 compared to the prior year period primarily due to reductions in legal, professional and consulting fees.\nUnallocated corporate expenses for FY 2018 decreased by 14.7% primarily due to reductions in legal, professional and consulting fees, partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation expense due to our improved performance.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nLayne's measure of Total Adjusted EBITDA, which may not be comparable to other companies' measure of Total Adjusted EBITDA, represents net income (loss) excluding discontinued operations, taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization, gain or loss on sale of fixed assets, non-cash equity-based compensation, equity in earnings or losses from affiliates, certain non-recurring items such as restructuring costs, and certain other gains or losses, plus dividends received from affiliates. Total Adjusted EBITDA is included as a complement to results provided in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) because management believes this non-GAAP financial measure helps in understanding and evaluating Layne's operating performance and trends and may be useful to investors. Layne management evaluates segment performance based on the segment's revenues and Adjusted EBITDA, among other factors. In addition, we use Total Adjusted EBITDA as a factor in incentive compensation decisions and our credit facility agreement uses measures similar to Total Adjusted EBITDA to measure compliance with certain covenants.\nThe following table reconciles net income (loss) to Total Adjusted EBITDA -\nThree Months\nFiscal Year\nEnded January 31,\nEnded January 31,\n(in thousands)\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nNet income (loss)\n$\n2,575\n$\n(33,080)\n$\n(27,311)\n$\n(52,236)\nItems not included in Total Adjusted EBITDA\nNet loss from discontinued operations\n118\n3,928\n22,447\n5,187\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\n(12,118)\n(404)\n(10,375)\n1,420\nInterest expense\n4,375\n4,222\n17,120\n16,883\nDepreciation and amortization\n7,023\n6,300\n26,701\n25,302\nGain on sale of fixed assets\n(1,828)\n(1,058)\n(3,741)\n(3,886)\nNon-cash equity-based compensation\n836\n757\n3,379\n3,394\nEquity in earnings of affiliates\n(338)\n(739)\n(3,431)\n(2,655)\nRestructuring costs\n2,695\n14,148\n4,903\n16,924\nOther expense (income), net\n11\n(178)\n15\n(843)\nDividends received from affiliates\n2,102\n1,927\n5,304\n4,941\nTotal Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n5,451\n$\n(4,177)\n$\n35,011\n$\n14,431\nConference Call\nLayne Christensen will conduct a conference call at 9:00 AM ET / 8:00 AM CT on Wednesday, April 11, 2018, to discuss these results and related matters.
