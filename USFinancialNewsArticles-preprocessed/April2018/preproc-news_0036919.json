(TSX:ORV) (the \"Company\" or \"Orvana\") is pleased to report production results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 (\"Q2 2018\"), featuring a 7% increase in consolidated gold production compared to the previous quarter, to an aggregate of 24,788 ounces and an increase in gold equivalent production of 4% to an aggregate of 31,905 gold equivalent ounces.\nQ2 2018 Highlights\nEl Valle Mine (Spain): Gold output increased by 40% compared to Q1 2018 and returned to production level achieved in Q4 2017; Gold grade increased by 25% from previous quarter, to 3.36 g/t. Don Mario Mine (Bolivia): Planned transition of mining activities to open-pit, Cerro Felix deposit substantially completed; Gold recovery of 91.3% continued to exceed target of 85%.\nProduction Summary\nQ2 2018\nQ1 2018\nYear-to-date\nFY 2018\nEl Valle\nDon Mario\nTotal\nEl Valle\nDon Mario\nTotal\nTotal\nOperating Performance\nOre milled (tonnes) (dmt)\n150,966\n178,698\n329,664\n131,286\n181,090\n312,376\n642,040\nGold Equivalent\nProduction (oz)\n19,022\n12,883\n31,905\n13,434\n17,223\n30,657\n62,562\nGold\nGrade (g/t)\n3.36\n1.84\n2.54\n2.69\n2.48\n2.57\n2.55\nRecovery (%)\n92.9\n91.3\n92.2\n95.0\n85.8\n89.8\n91.1\nProduction (oz)\n15,139\n9,649\n24,788\n10,784\n12,388\n23,172\n47,960\nCopper\nGrade (%)\n0.51\n0.62\n0.57\n0.38\n0.82\n0.64\n0.60\nRecovery (%)\n80.4\n50.3\n63.0\n81.2\n57.0\n63.1\n63.1\nProduction ('000 lbs)\n1,372\n1,237\n2,609\n886\n1,873\n2,759\n5,368\nJuan Gavidia, Interim CEO stated, \"We are pleased with the operational recovery at El Valle this quarter after the challenges we faced at the beginning of the fiscal year. El Valle continues to ramp up its oxides mining and processing activities as it moves towards our stated objective of attaining an oxides processing mix target of 50% and overall higher gold grade. At Don Mario, mining activities are currently transitioning, as planned, from the depleted Lower Mineralized Zone extension to the Cerro Felix satellite deposit. We expect that the gold grade will recover during the third quarter in accordance with our mining plan. We are currently completing our planned mid-year review of the operational outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2018 which will be reported with the release of our second quarter financial results.\"\nProduction – El Valle Mine\nGold output of 15,139 ounces of gold in Q2 2018, an increase of 40% compared to 10,784 ounces of gold produced in Q1 2018; Copper output in Q2 2018 was 1.4 million pounds, compared to 0.9 million pounds in Q1 2018, an increase of 56%; Ore throughput was 150,966 dmt in Q2 2018 comprising 34% oxides ore, compared to 131,286 dmt in Q1 2018, an increase of 15%; as a consequence, the gold grade at El Valle increased by 25% in Q2 2018. Mechanical advance rates in the oxides mining zones increased by 12% compared to Q1 2018, yielding 1,594 meters of development in Q2 2018. The increased rates are expected to position the mine to deliver the requisite oxide ore tonnage for the mill.\nProduction – Don Mario Mine\nGold output was 9,649 ounces in Q2 2018, a decrease of 22% compared to 12,388 ounces in Q1 2018. Ore production was impacted by the planned transition of mining activities from the depleted Lower Mineralized Zone extension (\"LMZ\") to the Cerro Felix satellite deposit. Gold grade of 1.84 g/t in Q2 2018 versus 2.48 g/t in Q1 2018 due to ore dilution caused by stripping activities at Cerro Felix during mine ramp up; Copper production in Q2 2018 was 1.2 million pounds, compared to 1.9 million pounds in Q1 2018 due to the depletion of LMZ and transition to Cerro Felix gold deposit. This was the final quarter of planned copper concentrate production at Don Mario in FY 2018.\nAbout Orvana\nOrvana is a multi-mine gold and copper producer. Orvana's operating assets consist of the producing El Valle and Carlés gold-copper-silver mines in northern Spain and the producing Don Mario gold mine in Bolivia.
