Cannabis Science announces that a court date has been set for April 20th, 2018 (4/20), for the Company’s lawsuit against San Joaquin County.

The plaintiffs’ lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California.\n2. Cannabis Science’s Economic Development Initiative Update – Cannabis Science’s Economic Development Initiative is well underway, and the Company previously announced its first major project with Free Spirit Organics Native American Corporation (FSO NAC), HRM Farms, and the Company’s University partners for a comprehensive educational, economic, and property development program. With the Universities at the helm, FSO NAC, HRM Farms, Cannabis Science, and its University partners are poised to become among the country's leading educational cannabinoid producers for specific demographic legal, medical & specific trade education creating a vibrant economic growth program for any City, Country or State. The flagship educational partner, Raymond C. Dabney University (RCDU) leads a consortium of Universities, including American States University (ASU); these and other University partners and associates will provide educational packages for each community in Agriculture, Law, Business, Healthcare, and 37 other trade industries, as well as entrepreneurial job creation programs.\nThe main function of the University Partnerships is the responsibility and complete oversight of the Company’s Economic Development Initiative. A primary goal of RCDU is to provide financially challenged communities an affordable opportunity to acquire a quality education beginning with a structured and regulated program in a number of diverse industries while placing an immediate focus on job creation for a very large number of industries. As an intricate part of each FSO NAC land package deal, the implementing partners expect to provide full scholarships and additionally-subsidized education packages to members of the Native American community and any other challenged individuals with the desire to grow with the initiative. The Cannabis Science Economic Development Plan, in cooperation with FSO NAC, includes a number of the following customized for each community:\na. Academic and vocational training covering each applied industry;\nb. Development of healthcare infrastructure, including hospitals and health centers;\nc. Pharmaceutical development;\nd. Creation of a sustainable, food security system that is based on sound agricultural practices that produce sufficient food for consumption and that are designed to reduce poverty and allow for real farm-to-table programs;\ne. Development of water management systems;\nf. Development of waste management systems that reduce the prevalence of critical risk factors for infectious diseases;\ng. Investment in communications infrastructure, to include satellite, Internet, mechanical device development, and cellphone infrastructure;\nh. Support for policy, regulatory, and jurisdictional environments, as they pertain to public healthcare, agriculture, education; and\ni.

Preparation of Cannabis Science Pharmacies for Grand Opening – Cannabis Science is finalizing the buildout and upgrades to the first two CBIS Pharmacies in California, and the first Pharmacy is scheduled to open on April 20th. Throughout the buildout process, the team has successfully responded to a number of changes to city codes and licensing regulations. “We are excited to open these innovative and beautiful new Pharmacies in California,” stated Dr. Allen Herman, Cannabis Science’s Chief Medical Officer (CMO). “This has been a major undertaking with the renovations of our two initial California pharmacy locations, and our project management and construction teams have met the challenge. These first pharmacies will serve as the foundation and blueprint for the acquisition and opening of new CBIS Pharmacies throughout California and the U.S.”\nThe launching of Cannabis Science’s Pharmacies is an important part of the Company’s overall drug-development strategy. These Pharmacies will provide Cannabis Science with an important retail sales channel and will enable the Company to interact directly with those who will benefit from its medicines – Cannabis Science’s patients.\nThe Cannabis Science Pharmacies will showcase the Company’s brand of high-quality cannabinoid and cannabis-based products and accessories for patients, doctors, and the consuming public. These products will range from pills, creams, extracts, sprays, tinctures, edibles, balms, patches, oils, raw products, and merchandise.

Planning for Cannabis Science’s Medical Centers – The Company is developing plans to establish Cannabis Science Medical Centers and has identified several opportunities to acquire buildings in Los Angeles area for its first CBIS Medical Center. The Cannabis Science Medical Centers will include full laboratory facilities, patient intake, and doctor and nurse clinics. The Company will also explore opportunities to contract for U.S. Federal Government-approved Emergency Medical Services, given its eligibility to bid for U.S. Federal Government contracts and grants. Cannabis Science is a registered vendor in the U.S. Federal Government’s System for Award Management (SAM) and has successfully received a CAGE Code, one of the few companies in its industry to do so. Additional space within the Cannabis Science Medical Centers will be leased to physician groups and other medical cannabinoid related health services and well-being providers. “I am particularly excited about the Cannabis Science Medical Center, as this was always one of our main goals,” stated Mr. Dabney. “This facility will serve as a hub for our activities. Not only will physicians be able to consult directly with patients at the Center, but the Company will also be able to coordinate and expand its global reach and research on cannabinoid-based drugs related to development initiatives through the Cannabis Science Global Research Consortium.”\n5.

Acquisition of Bottle It, Inc. – On March 19, 2018, Cannabis Science announced the acquisition of Bottle It, Inc. “Cannabis Science’s acquisition of Bottle It contributes significantly to our Company’s growth strategy and solidifies our capabilities as a manufacturer,” stated Mr. Dabney. “We now have the in-house capacity to manufacture PET bottles and containers for Cannabis Science’s consumer products, as well as to manufacture bottles and containers for other manufactures of beverages, specialty waters, foods, cosmetics, and other products globally. This creates an important new revenue stream for Cannabis Science.” With new investment to expand Bottle It’s manufacturing facility, along with demand for bottles and containers from Cannabis Science and other product producers, the Company believes it can grow Bottle It’s revenue substantially in the next few years. The global market for plastic containers was approximately $273 billion in 2014, and is expected to grow to over $388 billion in 2020.\nEstablished in 2014, Bottle It is a PET injection-mold and blow-mold manufacturer servicing the food and beverage industry with reported annual revenue of approximately $1.5 million in 2016 and 2017. Bottle It manufactures pre-forms for various bottled waters, energy drinks, vitamin shots, tinctures, drops, various pill bottles, and sprays, as well as various food containers for rice, flour, milk, dry food mixes, spices, mixed nuts, cookies, etc.\nIn the U.S., the market for pharmaceutical plastic bottles was over $6.5 billion in 2016, and should grow to over $9 billion by the end of 2024. Additionally, plastic bottles and containers will realize growth with demand for unit-dose packaging for pharmaceutical products, which is a high-growth end market for plastic packaging. End-user industries like healthcare and bottled water are augmenting the usage of plastics and thus driving the demand in fast-growth markets in Asia and other emerging regions. Americans purchase approximately 42.6 billion individual 1-liter bottles of water annually. Globally, people use approximately 200 billion plastic water bottles per year. Wine and liquor use approximately 5.4 billion bottles per year, energy drinks 4.2 billion, sports drinks 5.4 billion, tea 7.9 billion, fruit beverages 15 billion, milk 17.6 billion, soft drinks 81.9 billion, and beer 62 billion bottles.\n6. Acquisition of Cannabia ® - On March 14, 2018, Cannabis Science announced a new partnership with Crown Baus Capital Corporation (OTC: CBCA) to distribute Cannabia® in the United States and Canada. Crown Baus Capital acquired a 100% stake in Cannabia®, the world’s first alcoholic, cannabis beer.\n\"The acquisition of Cannabia® and Cannabis Science’s distribution partnership with Crown Baus Capital are strategically important to the growth strategy of our company and our partners, and more acquisitions are planned to complement our operational growth and maximize profitability so savings can be passed on to our valued, self-medicating patients and general public consumers,” stated Mr. Dabney. Cannabia® sales have been growing 15 to 25% per year, and beverage sales are expected to increase substantially as Cannabis Science introduces Cannabia® products into the U.S. and Canadian markets. California alone is the world’s sixth-largest economy with a GDP of $2.5 trillion. This represents a very large market opportunity for Cannabis Science, who will distribute Cannabia® non-alcoholic beverage lines through its Pharmacies. Cannabis Science’s President, CEO, and Co-founder, Mr. Raymond C. Dabney, is the President, CEO, and Co-founder of Crown Baus Capital.

This move will also facilitate the Company’s growth model in Europe for this acquisition and other activities, as well as provide the necessary infrastructure to manage supply-chain logistics and new product development. Cannabis Science intends to establish a new hemp farm in The Netherlands, as well as in Spain, to provide for the Company’s formulations and the development of new products for distribution throughout the European market. Mr. Alfredo Dupetit, Founder and CEO of Dupetit Natural Products GMBH, has been named Cannabis Science’s President and CEO of European Operations.\n8.
