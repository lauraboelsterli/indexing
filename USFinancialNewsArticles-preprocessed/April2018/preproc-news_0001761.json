    "text": "CHICAGO, April 4, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Physician-Patient Alliance for Health & Safety (PPAHS) is very pleased to announce that Marilyn Neder Flack, who was the Senior Vice President, Patient Safety Initiatives at the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) and Executive Director at the AAMI Foundation , has been appointed to PPAHS's board of advisors.\nDuring her tenure at AAMI, Ms. Flack's spearheaded key patient safety initiatives, including clinical alarm management, continuous electronic monitoring of patients on opioids, home healthcare technology, safe infusion therapy safety, and the safe use of complex health technology.\nSaid Michael Wong, JD (Founder and Executive Director, PPAHS) about Ms. Flack's appointment:\n\"Marilyn has been a driving force at AAMI of two key coalitions - the National Coalition to Promote Continuous Monitoring of Patients on Opioids to establish the business case and to educate and encourage hospitals to adopt continuous monitoring for all patients on parenteral opioids and the National Coalition for Alarm Management Safety to improve alarm management.\"\n\"Opioid safety and alarm safety are two key initiatives at the Physician-Patient Alliance for Health & Safety, and so when I heard that Marilyn was retiring from AAMI, it was only natural to invite her to join us in helping us achieve both these objectives of safe opioid and alarm use.\"\n\"We are extremely delighted to have Marilyn join our board of advisors and bring to us her passion and energy for improving patient safety.\"\nIn accepting the appointment, Ms. Flack said:\n\"Of all the coalitions that I started and been involved with at AAMI, the National Coalition to Promote Continuous Monitoring of Patients on Opioids is nearest to my heart. The only way currently to keep patients receiving opioids safe is through continuous electronic monitoring.\"\n\"So, I share with PPAHS a commitment to having all patients receiving opioids in healthcare facilities continuously electronically monitored. My involvement with PPAHS will allow me to continue to pursue this objective and help ensure the safe use of opioids.\"\nPPAHS recently released on the PPAHS YouTube Channel, the AAMI video featuring Ms. Flack, Dr. Frank Overdyk, and Laura Townsend on the need for all hospitals to continuously monitor their patients receiving opioids.
