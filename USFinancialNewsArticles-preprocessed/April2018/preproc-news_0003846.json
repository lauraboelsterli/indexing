    "text": "HOUSTON, April 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Civeo Corporation (\"Civeo\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:CVEO), one of the largest global providers of workforce accommodations, logistics and facility management services to the natural resource industry, announced today that it has closed its acquisition of 100% of the equity interests of Noralta Lodge Ltd.\nBradley J. Dodson, Civeo's President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We are pleased to close the acquisition of Noralta, strengthening our position as the partner of choice for our customers in the Canadian oil sands region. This represents an important milestone for Civeo, and on behalf of all our employees, I would like to welcome Noralta to the Civeo team. Looking ahead, we remain focused on generating free cash flow while delivering best in class service and strengthening our balance sheet, and will continue to opportunistically pursue organic and inorganic growth opportunities to support these priorities.”\nCiveo also completed the amendment and restatement of its credit facility. Among other things, the amended credit facility:\nextends the maturity date of the obligations thereunder by 18 months to November 30, 2020; reduces the permitted level of Civeo’s total leverage ratio (total debt to consolidated EBITDA) to a maximum of 4.50x for the first and second quarter of 2018, with further reductions to 4.25x in the third quarter of 2018, 3.75x in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 3.50x in the first quarter of 2019 and thereafter; increases the amortization rate from 5% per annum to 10% per annum; relaxes certain of the covenants to provide greater flexibility, including to enhance Civeo’s ability to make acquisitions and to incur indebtedness; and reduces revolving borrowing availability to a level more consistent with the expected needs, which will reduce undrawn commitment fees.\nAdditional information on the terms of the amended credit facility can be found in a separate Form 8-K being filed today by Civeo with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In connection with the closing of the Noralta acquisition, the Company borrowed approximately $166 million under the credit facility to fund a portion of the cash consideration to the sellers, resulting in approximately $71 million of remaining borrowing availability thereunder.\nAbout Civeo\nCiveo Corporation is a leading provider of workforce accommodations with prominent market positions in the Canadian oil sands and the Australian natural resource regions.
