(NASDAQ:GNBC), the bank holding company (“Green Bancorp” or the “Company”) that operates Green Bank, N.A. (“Green Bank”), today announced results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018. The Company reported net income for the quarter of $9.4 million, or $0.25 per diluted common share.\nManny Mehos, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Green Bancorp, said, “We reported pre-tax, pre-provision operating earnings for the first quarter of $21.7 million, up 8% annualized from the $21.3 million that we reported in the fourth quarter of 2017, which demonstrates the core earnings power of the Bank. While our provision expense was elevated this quarter primarily related to a healthcare credit that moved to nonaccrual, we are confident that our credit profile is stable, our problem loans are isolated, and our NPA trends are expected to show meaningful improvement. Given the confidence in our outlook, our Board of Directors has determined that it is in the best interest of the Company and our shareholders to initiate a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share to be paid in May. We believe this decision reflects the Bank’s improved financial performance that we have experienced over the last year which we expect to continue.”\nGeoff Greenwade, President of Green Bancorp and Chief Executive Officer of Green Bank, commented, “During the first quarter, we experienced typical seasonal trends which led to a $54.0 million decline in loan balances. Looking forward, the economic backdrop in our primary markets remains favorable and we remain confident in our guidance of 7 to 9% loan growth for the full year 2018. We also continued to make solid progress in growing our core deposit base, as noninterest-bearing deposits increased $46.1 million and now comprise 24.6% of total deposits. The successful execution of our strategy to improve our deposit mix should help to offset some of the deposit price pressures that will come as the Fed continues to raise interest rates.”\nResults of Operations - Quarter Ended March 31, 2018 compared with Quarter Ended December 31, 2017\nNet income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $9.4 million, an increase of $6.7 million, or 257.5%, compared with $2.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Net income per diluted common share was $0.25 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared with $0.07 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was reduced by income tax expense of $5.8 million related to the deferred tax asset revaluation due to enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and $3.1 million in stock-based compensation expense, or $2.0 million net of the related tax benefit, for the accelerated vesting of certain performance options, with no comparable expenses in the quarter ended March 31, 2018. During the quarter ended March 31, 2018, provision for loan losses increased $5.3 million, which was offset by increases of $1.4 million in net interest income and $1.2 million in noninterest income. Provision for income taxes decreased during the current quarter due to lower pre-tax net income and the reduction in the statutory tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Returns on average assets and average common equity, each on an annualized basis, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were 0.90% and 8.15%, respectively. Green Bancorp’s efficiency ratio, which represents noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income, was 50.81% for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nNet interest income before provision for loan losses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased $1.4 million, or 3.9%, to $38.2 million, compared with $36.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The increase in net interest income was comprised of a $1.9 million, or 4.2%, increase in interest income, offset by a $500 thousand, or 5.9%, increase in interest expense. Net interest margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was 3.87%, compared with 3.64% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nNoninterest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $5.2 million, an increase of $1.2 million, or 31.3%, from $3.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to a $1.1 million net loss on held for sale loans in the prior quarter, with no loss recorded in the current quarter, offset by $707 thousand decrease in gain on sale of guaranteed portion of loans.\nNoninterest expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $22.1 million, a decrease of $1.5 million, or 6.5%, from $23.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a $1.4 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits, a $585 thousand decrease in loan related expenses, offset by a $575 thousand increase in the reserve for unfunded commitments. The $1.4 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits is primarily due to the $3.1 million in stock-based compensation expense for the accelerated vesting of certain performance options recorded in the quarter ended December 31, 2017, which was offset by additional stock-based compensation expense of $1.2 million in the current quarter. The additional stock-based compensation expense in the current quarter includes $701 thousand related to new awards issued during the restructuring of the remaining performance options and an increase of $335 thousand related to stock appreciation rights.\nTotal loans, which includes loans held for investment and loans held for sale, at March 31, 2018 were $3.1 billion, a decrease of $53.8 million, or 1.7%, when compared with December 31, 2017. The decrease is primarily due to a $34.4 million decrease in mortgage warehouse loans, $27.6 million decrease in commercial and industrial loans and a $16.2 million reduction in construction and land loans, offset by a $20.1 million increase in owner occupied commercial real estate loans. At March 31, 2018, energy loans totaled $50.0 million, or 1.6% of total loans. SBA loans comprise the balance of loans held for sale at March 31, 2018.\nDeposits at March 31, 2018 were $3.5 billion, an increase of $56.6 million, or 1.7%, compared with December 31, 2017. The net increase is comprised of increases of $46.1 million, or 5.7%, in noninterest-bearing deposits, $6.4 million in interest-bearing transaction and savings deposits and $4.1 million in time deposits. Noninterest-bearing deposits totaled 24.6% of total deposits at March 31, 2018. Average deposits decreased $73.5 million, or 2.1%, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared with the prior quarter.\nAsset Quality - Quarter Ended March 31, 2018 compared with Quarter Ended December 31, 2017\nNonperforming assets totaled $84.7 million, or 2.00% of period end total assets, at March 31, 2018, an increase of $13.1 million, compared with $71.6 million, or 1.68% of period end total assets, at December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to the downgrade of a syndicated healthcare credit. Accruing loans classified as troubled debt restructures and included in the nonperforming asset totals were $13.6 million at March 31, 2018, compared with $13.1 million at December 31, 2017. Real estate acquired through foreclosure totaled $802 thousand at March 31, 2018.\nThe allowance for loan losses was 1.22% of total loans held for investment at March 31, 2018, compared with 0.98% of total loans held for investment at December 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, the Company’s allowance for loan losses to total loans held for investment, excluding acquired loans that are accounted for under ASC 310-20 and ASC 310-30 and their related allowance, was 1.36%. Further, the allowance for loan losses plus acquired loan net discount to total loans held for investment adjusted for acquired loan net discount was 1.33% as of March 31, 2018.\nThe Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $9.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 up from the $4.4 million provision for loan losses recorded for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The first quarter of 2018 provision was primarily due to the addition of specific reserves, with $3.8 million related to energy loans and $5.9 million to a syndicated healthcare credit. Uncertainty related to loans in the counties affected by Hurricane Harvey has significantly diminished as we continue to monitor the loans initially identified as having some level of impact.\nNet charge-offs were $2.7 million, or 0.08% of average loans, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared with net charge-offs of $6.7 million, or 0.22% of average loans, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Net charge-offs included partial charge-offs of $2.7 million in energy production loans during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, a decrease from $6.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nDividend Information\nOn April 25, 2018, Green Bancorp’s Board of Directors declared the initiation of a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share on its outstanding shares of common stock, payable on May 24, 2018 to shareholders of record as of May 10, 2018.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nGreen Bancorp’s management uses certain non−GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures to evaluate its performance. Specifically, Green Bancorp reviews tangible book value per common share, the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio, the return on average tangible common equity ratio, allowance for loan losses less allowance for loan losses on acquired loans to total loans held for investment excluding acquired loans, allowance for loan losses plus acquired loans net discount to total loans held for investment adjusted for acquired loan net discount, operating earnings, pre-tax, pre-provision operating earnings, diluted operating earnings per share, operating return on average assets, operating return on average tangible common equity and operating efficiency ratio.

accordance with the SEC’s rules, we classify a financial measure as being a non‑GAAP financial measure if that financial measure excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding or including amounts, that are included or excluded, as the case may be, in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as in effect from time to time in the United States in our statements of income, balance sheet or statements of cash flows. Non‑GAAP financial measures do not include operating and other statistical measures or ratios or statistical measures calculated using exclusively either financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, operating measures or other measures that are not non‑GAAP financial measures or both.\nThe non‑GAAP financial measures that we discuss in this release should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable or other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which we calculate the non‑GAAP financial measures that we discuss in this release may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names. You should understand how such other banking organizations calculate their financial measures similar or with names similar to the non‑GAAP financial measures we have discussed in this release when comparing such non‑GAAP financial measures.\nTangible Book Value Per Common Share. Tangible book value is a non‑GAAP measure generally used by financial analysts and investment bankers to evaluate financial institutions. We calculate: (a) tangible common equity as shareholders’ equity less goodwill and core deposit intangibles, net of accumulated amortization; and (b) tangible book value per common share as tangible common equity (as described in clause (a)) divided by shares of common stock outstanding. For tangible book value, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is our book value.\nWe believe that this measure is important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in changes from period to period in book value per common share exclusive of changes in intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets have the effect of increasing total book value while not increasing our tangible book value.\nThe following table reconciles, as of the dates set forth below, total shareholders’ equity to tangible common equity and presents our tangible book value per common share compared with our book value per common share:\nMar 31, 2018 Dec 31, 2017 Sep 30, 2017 Jun 30, 2017 Mar 31, 2017 (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Tangible Common Equity Total shareholders’ equity $ 468,878 $ 463,795 $ 462,311 $ 451,741 $ 437,288 Adjustments: Goodwill 85,291 85,291 85,291 85,291 85,291 Core deposit intangibles 8,187 8,503 8,835 9,215 9,595 Tangible common equity $ 375,400 $ 370,001 $ 368,185 $ 357,235 $ 342,402 Common shares outstanding (1) 37,163 37,103 37,096 37,035 37,015 Book value per common share (1) $ 12.62 $ 12.50 $ 12.46 $ 12.20 $ 11.81 Tangible book value per common share (1) $ 10.10 $ 9.97 $ 9.93 $ 9.65 $ 9.25 (1) Excludes the dilutive effect of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options.

This measure reports the combined allowance for loan loss and acquired loan net discount (or premium) as a percentage of loans held for investment inclusive of the acquired loan net discount (or premium) which may assist the investor in evaluating allowance coverage on loans inclusive of additional discount or premium resulting from purchase accounting adjustments.\nThe following table reconciles, as of the dates set forth below, allowance for loan losses plus acquired loans net discount to total loans adjusted for acquired loan net discount:\nMar 31, 2018 Dec 31, 2017 Sep 30, 2017 Jun 30, 2017 Mar 31, 2017 (Dollars in thousands) Allowance for loan losses plus acquired loan net\ndiscount Allowance for loan losses at end of period $ 38,233 $ 31,220 $ 33,480 $ 31,991 $ 31,936 Plus: Net discount on acquired loans 3,495 4,371 5,112 6,240 7,314 Total allowance plus acquired loan net discount $ 41,728 $ 35,591 $ 38,592 $ 38,231 $ 39,250 Total loans held for investment adjusted for acquired\nloan net discount Total loans held for investment $ 3,136,336 $ 3,190,485 $ 3,071,761 $ 3,123,355 $ 3,012,275 Plus: Net discount on acquired loans 3,495 4,371 5,112 6,240 7,314 Total loans held for investment adjusted for\nacquired loan net discount $ 3,139,831 $ 3,194,856 $ 3,076,873 $ 3,129,595 $ 3,019,589 Allowance for loan losses plus acquired loan net\ndiscount loans to total loans held for investment\nadjusted for acquired loan net discount 1.33 % 1.11 % 1.25 % 1.22 % 1.30 %\nGreen Bancorp, Inc.\nNotes to Financial Highlights\n(Unaudited)\nOperating Earnings, Pre-tax, Pre-provision Operating Earnings and performance metrics calculated using Operating Earnings and Pre-tax, Pre-provision Operating Earnings, including Diluted Operating Earnings per Share, Operating Return on Average Assets, Operating Return on Average Tangible Common Equity and Operating Efficiency Ratio. Operating earnings and pre-tax, pre-provision operating earnings are non GAAP measures used by management to evaluate the Company’s financial performance. We calculate (a) operating earnings as net income (loss) plus loss (gain) on sale of securities available-for-sale, net, plus loss (gain) on held for sale loans, net, plus stock based compensation expense for performance option vesting, plus shelf and secondary offering expenses. We calculate (b) pre-tax, pre-provision operating earnings as (a) operating earnings plus provision (benefit) for income taxes, plus provision for loan losses.\nWe believe that these measures and the operating metrics calculated utilizing these measures are important to management and many investors in the marketplace who are interested in understanding the ongoing operating performance of the company and provide meaningful comparisons to its peers.\nThe following tables reconcile, as of the dates set forth below, operating earnings and pre-tax, pre-provision operating earnings and related metrics:\nGreen Bancorp, Inc.\nNotes to Financial Highlights\n(Unaudited)\nAs of and for the Quarter Ended Mar 31, 2018 Dec 31, 2017 Sep 30, 2017 Jun 30, 2017 Mar 31, 2017 (Dollars in thousands) Operating Earnings Net Income (loss) $ 9,362 $ 2,619 $ 11,407 $ 12,898 $ 7,212 Plus: Loss (gain) on sale of securities available-for-\nsale, net — — 332 (294 ) — Plus: Loss (gain) on held for sale loans, net — 1,098 1,294 (222 ) 138 Plus: Stock based compensation expense for\nperformance option vesting — 3,051 — — — Plus: Shelf and secondary offering expenses 397 — — — — Less: Tax benefit at the statutory rate 83 1,452 $ 569 (181 ) 48 Net operating earnings $ 9,676 $ 5,316 $ 12,464 $ 12,563 $ 7,302 Weighted average diluted shares outstanding 37,586 37,393 37,332 37,264 37,238 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.25 $ 0.07 $ 0.31 $ 0.35 $ 0.19 Diluted operating earnings per share 0.26 0.14 0.33 0.34 0.20 Pre-Tax, Pre-Provision Operating Earnings Net Income (loss) $ 9,362 $ 2,619 $ 11,407 $ 12,898 $ 7,212 Plus: Provision (benefit) for income taxes 2,322 10,142 5,895 6,985 3,942 Plus: Provision for loan losses 9,663 4,405 2,300 1,510 6,145 Plus: Loss (gain) on sale of securities available-for-\nsale, net — — 332 (294 ) — Plus: Loss (gain) on held for sale loans, net — 1,098 1,294 (222 ) 138 Plus: Stock based compensation expense for\nperformance option vesting — 3,051 — — — Plus: Shelf and secondary offering expenses 397 — — — — Net pre-tax, pre-provision operating earnings $ 21,744 $ 21,315 $ 21,228 $ 20,877 $ 17,437 Total average assets $ 4,204,200 $ 4,204,105 $ 4,131,706 $ 4,096,386 $ 4,016,744 Pre-tax, pre-provision operating return on average\nassets (annualized) 2.10 % 2.01 % 2.04 % 2.04 % 1.76 %\nGreen Bancorp, Inc.\nNotes to Financial Highlights\n(Unaudited)\nAs of and for the Quarter Ended Mar 31, 2018 Dec 31, 2017 Sep 30, 2017 Jun 30, 2017 Mar 31, 2017 (Dollars in thousands) Average Total Assets $ 4,204,200 $ 4,204,105 $ 4,131,706 $ 4,096,386 $ 4,016,744 Return on average assets 0.90 % 0.25 % 1.10 % 1.26 % 0.73 % Operating return on average assets (annualized) 0.93 % 0.50 % 1.20 % 1.23 % 0.74 % Operating earnings adjusted for amortization of core\ndeposit intangibles Operating earnings $ 9,676 $ 5,316 $ 12,464 $ 12,563 $ 7,302 Adjustments: Plus: Amortization of core deposit intangibles 316 330 380 380 380 Less: Tax benefit at the statutory rate 66 116 133 133 133 Operating earnings adjusted for amortization of core\ndeposit intangibles $ 9,926 $ 5,530 $ 12,711 $ 12,810 $ 7,549 Average Tangible Common Equity Total average shareholders’ equity $ 466,015 $ 465,859 $ 457,303 $ 445,334 $ 435,695 Adjustments: Average goodwill 85,291 85,291 85,291 85,291 85,291 Average core deposit intangibles 8,343 8,661 9,065 9,461 9,844 Average tangible common equity $ 372,381 $ 371,907 $ 362,947 $ 350,582 $ 340,560 Operating return on average tangible common\nequity (Annualized), operating earnings 10.81 % 5.90 % 13.89 % 14.66 % 8.99 % Efficiency ratio 50.81 % 57.87 % 50.59 % 47.83 % 54.64 % Operating efficiency ratio 49.90 % 47.69 % 46.49 % 49.09 % 54.28 %\nSource:Green Bancorp, Inc.",
