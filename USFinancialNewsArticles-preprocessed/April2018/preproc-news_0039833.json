    "text": "CLINTON, Conn., April 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Connecticut Water Service, Inc. (NASDAQ: CTWS) today confirmed that after it entered into a definitive merger agreement with SJW Group (NYSE: SJW), the Company received a non-binding, unsolicited acquisition proposal from Eversource Energy (NYSE: ES) for $63.50 per share in cash and/or in Eversource common stock at the election of Connecticut Water shareholders.\nIn accordance with the terms of the SJW Group merger agreement, Connecticut Water's Board of Directors, in consultation with its legal and financial advisors, carefully reviewed Eversource's unsolicited acquisition proposal and today unanimously concluded that it is not a superior proposal or reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal as defined by Connecticut Water's merger agreement with SJW Group.\nAs previously announced on March 15, under the terms of the SJW Group agreement, Connecticut Water shareholders will receive 1.1375 shares of SJW Group common stock for each share of Connecticut Water common stock they own, the equivalent of $63.70 per share based on SJW Group's closing share price on April 19, 2018. Following the closing of the transaction, Connecticut Water shareholders will own approximately 40 percent of the combined company and SJW Group shareholders will own approximately 60 percent, on a fully diluted basis.\nThe Connecticut Water Board of Directors continues to unanimously believe that the merger with SJW Group is in the best interest of all Connecticut Water shareholders, with significant long-term benefits for the Company's customers, employees and communities. In particular, the Company's merger with SJW Group delivers:\nSignificant, immediate premium with opportunity for continued substantial value creation. In addition to providing Connecticut Water shareholders with a premium based on the Company's unaffected stock price on March 14, 2018, the stock-based consideration provides shareholders with the opportunity to participate in the substantial upside value that is expected to be created as a result of the combined company's position as a leading, national, pure-play water utility company. Highly attractive earnings accretion. The SJW Group merger combination is expected to be immediately accretive to Connecticut Water's standalone earnings per share, achieving high-single digit accretion in the first fiscal year post-closing and maintaining mid- to high-single digit accretion over the next few years. Enhanced growth platform and expanded rate base as a result of increased scale, geographic diversity and strong financial foundation. The combined company will be the third largest investor-owned water and wastewater utility in the United States and will have a strong multi-state presence in California, Connecticut, Maine and Texas. The increased financial and operating scale of the new organization provide the opportunity for investments in service and reliability across a more diverse geographic footprint, enhancing value for shareholders as well as for customers and communities. Robust, stable dividend with immediate uplift. Upon closing and subject to market conditions and Board approval at the time, the new company is expected to establish a dividend at least equivalent to SJW Group's announced 2018 annual dividend of $1.12 per share. This represents an immediate dividend uplift of approximately 7 percent for Connecticut Water shareholders, when adjusted for the agreed exchange ratio, based on the annualized quarterly cash dividend of $0.2975 per share declared by Connecticut Water on November 9, 2017.\nSJW Group has paid a dividend for the last 74 consecutive years and has increased the annual dividend payment in each of the last 50 years. Connecticut Water has paid a dividend for the last 62 consecutive years and has increased the annual dividend payment in each of the last 48 years. Proven management team with a record of strategic execution, superior value creation and regional focus. The combined company will be led by an experienced Board of Directors and leadership team that leverages the strengths and capabilities of its subsidiaries. Over the past five years, the Connecticut Water team, who will remain in place following the close of the transaction, has delivered a 154 percent total return to the Company's shareholders, outperforming Connecticut Water's peers and the Dow Jones Utility Average Index by 54 percent and 122 percent, respectively. (The Company noted that over the same period Eversource returned only 57 percent. Long-term benefits for customers, employees and communities. The merger with SJW Group will maintain Connecticut Water's longstanding commitments to outstanding customer service, which will be enhanced by sharing of best practices, operational expertise and more extensive resources.\nEach of the combined company's operating utilities and their customers will continue to be supported locally by a team of passionate, dedicated employees and existing leaders, with no merger-related layoffs or significant changes in employee compensation or benefits packages planned.\nIn addition to retaining dedicated employee teams across its footprint, the new company will maintain Connecticut Water's environmental stewardship and strong community ties, including a focus on supporting economic development with investments in growth, safety and reliability.\nIn reaching the unanimous determination that the Eversource acquisition proposal was not a superior proposal or reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal, and in reaffirming its intention to unanimously recommend that all Connecticut Water shareholders vote FOR the SJW Group merger, the Connecticut Water Board considered the numerous financial and strategic benefits of the SJW Group merger, as reviewed above, and, among other things, that:\nThe proposed merger with SJW Group is expected to create greater value for Connecticut Water and its shareholders than pursuing Eversource's unsolicited acquisition proposal, noting that over the past five years, Connecticut Water has delivered a 154 percent total return to the Company's shareholders compared to only 57 percent for Eversource over the same period; The proposed merger of Connecticut Water and SJW Group presents Connecticut Water shareholders with the opportunity to benefit from enhanced future growth prospects, financial strength and a compelling total return profile for the pro forma combined company, while allowing Connecticut Water shareholders to maintain their investment in a pure-play water utility; and Connecticut Water shareholders will maintain a meaningful ownership position in the combined pure-play water company and continue to benefit from a proven management team who has a record of delivering superior value creation and world-class customer service that supports strong operations and regulatory relationships.\nWhile Connecticut Water has regularly achieved customer satisfaction rankings above 90 percent, Eversource was ranked in the bottom quartile of J.D. Power's 2017 customer service rankings for the East Region and was ranked near the bottom nationally. For Connecticut Water, delivering safe, clean drinking water is the priority for 100% of its customers as compared to a small percentage of Eversource's total customer base.\nCarol Wallace, Chairman of the Connecticut Water Board of Directors, said, \"The Connecticut Water Board and management team are committed to acting in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders. Having carefully reviewed the unsolicited acquisition proposal, we continue to believe that Connecticut Water's merger with SJW Group is in the best interest of our shareholders, particularly given the significant growth opportunity that the combined organization will have as a leading pure-play water company. We also believe our merger with SJW Group provides important benefits for customers, employees and communities that would be hard to replicate in a combination involving contiguous and overlapping territories, as was contemplated in the unsolicited Eversource acquisition proposal. Accordingly, the Connecticut Water Board remains firmly and unanimously in support of the SJW Group merger agreement.\"\nAs previously announced, Connecticut Water's merger with SJW Group is expected to close by year-end 2018, subject to customary closing conditions and approvals, including the approval of the issuance of shares in the transaction by SJW Group stockholders, the approval of Connecticut Water shareholders, the approvals of the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority and the Maine Public Utilities Commission, the approval of the Federal Communications Commission, and the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. The transaction is not subject to any financing condition.\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC is serving as Connecticut Water's financial advisor and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP as its legal counsel.\nAbout CTWS\nCTWS is a publicly traded holding company headquartered in Clinton, Connecticut. CTWS is the parent company of The Connecticut Water Company, The Maine Water Company, The Avon Water Company, and The Heritage Village Water Company. Together, these subsidiaries provide water service to more than 450,000 people in Connecticut and Maine, and wastewater service to more than 10,000 people in Connecticut.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.
