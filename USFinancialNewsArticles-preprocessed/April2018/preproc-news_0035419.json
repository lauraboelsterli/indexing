    "text": "Leading provider of life settlement portfolio servicing continues on growth track with strategic acquisition\nIRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- NorthStar Life Services, LLC, a full-service life settlement advisory firm that assists institutional and private investors with each stage of the life settlement investment cycle, today announced that it has completed the purchase of the business and assets of Torrey Pines Services, LLC. Torrey Pines Services provides policy servicing, portfolio management and optimization services to help owners of life insurance policies better manage their assets.\n“Torrey Pines has been a fixture of the industry for nearly a decade,” said John McFarland, chief executive officer of NorthStar Life Services. “Working with the Torrey Pines team has been an excellent experience and we are very pleased with the outcome. We look forward to deepening our relationship with their existing client base and will continue to look for ways to create additional value in the months and years to come.”\nWith the strategic acquisition of Torrey Pines, NorthStar continues on a trajectory of fast growth in the life settlement marketplace. The firm utilizes a proprietary technology platform and a core team of professional advisors to provide transaction advisory services, due diligence, portfolio and premium management, and medical underwriting services to life settlement investors.\n“NorthStar has been best in class since John took over and he has assembled a team of professionals with bona fide expertise in servicing, optimization, portfolio management, financing and market awareness,” said Ryan Danz, chief executive office of Torrey Pines Services and co-owner of the firm with Stephen Jeffrey. “NorthStar is a real one-stop shop and I can personally attest to the sophistication of the NorthStar software and staff. Our clients will not only benefit from a more robust platform with value-added services that Torrey Pines was not able to offer, but will have greater exposure to trading opportunities under the ownership of NorthStar.”\nNorthStar Life Services, LLC offers a full range of premier services to institutional and private investors in life insurance policies, providing assistance at every stage of the life settlement investment cycle. The firm manages every transaction and portfolio with a personalized solution that considers the investor’s goals, budgetary requirements and risk tolerance in order to construct a strategy designed to maximize investment returns.
