    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May said she would talk to President Donald Trump on Tuesday about a suspected chemical attack in Syria, as the United States considers a multinational military response.\nBritain's Prime Minister Theresa May speaks during a joint news conference with Sweden's Prime Minister Stefan Lofven (not in picture) at Rosenbad, Stockholm, Sweden April 9, 2018. TT News Agency/Jonas Ekstromer/via REUTERS Trump promised forceful action on Monday in response to a suspected Syrian poison gas attack that killed at least 60 people and injured more than 1,000 others. U.S. officials said military options were being developed.\nMay, wary of the domestic political risks of promising military action, has so far focused on the need to discover the facts about the attack and establish a common international response.\nBut, she has also said that those responsible must be held to account and British diplomats have indicated that all options remain on the table.\n“I’ll be continuing to talk with our allies and partners as I have done, speaking to President Macron this morning, and I’ll be speaking to President Trump later today,” she told reporters in Cambridgeshire in eastern England.\nBritain currently conducts air strikes in Syria from its military base in Cyprus, but only against targets linked to the Islamic State group.\nParliament voted down British military action against President Bashar al-Assad’s government in 2013, in a major embarrassment for May’s predecessor David Cameron that then deterred the U.S. administration of Barack Obama from similar action.\nWhen asked whether Britain would join the United States if Washington decided on further military action in Syria, May on Tuesday declined to answer the question directly but said: “We believe that those responsible should be held to account.”\nVOTE IN PARLIAMENT? Some members of May’s party have already called for her to consider committing to a military response without seeking parliament’s approval. The British parliament is currently not in session, and resumes on April 16.\nMay is not legally bound to get parliamentary approval before taking military action.\nHowever, a non-binding constitutional convention to seek approval has been established following a 2003 vote on the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. It has been observed in subsequent military deployments in Libya and Iraq.\n“The prime minister has the ability to call military action at any time,” said Catherine Haddon, senior fellow at the Institute For Government think-tank.\n“The parliamentary convention is just that - it’s a convention. Legally in terms of our constitution that power, the power to go to war, is still a Royal Prerogative and that means that it is exercised by the government on behalf of the crown.”\nMay said she would chair a meeting of Britain’s National Security Council later on Tuesday.\nAny decision to press ahead with military action without debate by parliament is fraught with political danger for May, whose government does not have a majority in Britain’s 650-seat house and relies on the support of a small Northern Irish party to govern.\nWith less than a year until Britain leaves the European Union, May is looking to deepen the so-called “special relationship” between her country and the United States with a wide-ranging free trade deal that would help cushion the impact of Brexit.\nReporting by Sarah Young and William James; editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Hugh Lawson\n ",
