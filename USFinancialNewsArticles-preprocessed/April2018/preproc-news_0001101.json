The individual investment yields are then weighted by the respective fair values of the investments (as of the date presented) in calculating the weighted average effective yield as a percentage of our debt and other income-producing investments. Infinite Care, LLC was excluded from the calculation as of December 31, 2017 because it was on non-accrual status on that date. CRS Reprocessing, LLC and Peekay Acquisition, LLC were excluded from the calculation as of December 31, 2016 because they were on non-accrual status on that date. Shinnecock CLO 2006-1, Ltd. and other equity components of the investment portfolio were also excluded from these calculations either because they do not have stated interest rates or are non-income producing. (2) The weighted average yield on total investments takes the same yields but weights them to determine the weighted average effective yield as a percentage of the Company's total investments. The weighted average annualized yield on the Company’s investments for a given period will generally be higher than what investors in our common stock would realize in a return over the same period because the dollar-weighted average annualized yield does not reflect the Company’s expenses or any sales load that may be paid by investors. FOURTH QUARTER 2017 OPERATING RESULTS\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported a $1.3 million decrease in net income, compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Net income was $1.5 million, or $0.23 per share, compared to net income of $2.8 million, or $0.44 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to lower net investment income and a negative change in net realized and unrealized gains on investments in the quarter ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported a $0.5 million decrease in net investment income, compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Net investment income was $1.9 million, or $0.30 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $2.4 million, or $0.39 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Net investment income decreased during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of lower total investment income, partially offset by lower total expenses in the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Investment income was lower primarily as a result of a smaller investment portfolio during the quarter ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our total portfolio investments at fair value and total assets were $115.6 million and $128.2 million, respectively, compared to $134.1 million and $143.0 million at December 31, 2016. Net asset value per share was $12.66 at December 31, 2017, compared to $13.86 at December 31, 2016.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company made investments in three companies totaling $12.7 million. One of the investments was in a new portfolio company and two were additional investments in existing portfolio companies. The Company also had investment sales and payoffs totaling $9.2 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017. The investment activity for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was as follows:\nNEW AND INCREMENTAL INVESTMENTS\nOn October 18, 2017, the Company made an additional $3.2 million senior secured debt investment and a $0.5 million equity investment in an existing portfolio company, King Engineering Associates, Inc. The debt investment carries an interest rate of LIBOR plus 10.00%.\nOn November 16, 2017, the Company made senior secured debt investments in Surge Busy Bee Holdings LLC. The debt investments consist of a $5.0 million term loan that carries an interest rate of LIBOR plus 10.00%, a $2.5 million term loan that carries a cash interest rate of 12.00% plus 2.00% PIK interest, and a $0.5 million revolver commitment that carries an interest rate of LIBOR plus 8.00%.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company made increases to and advances under its senior secured revolver commitment to Infinite Care, LLC totaling $1.1 million.\nINVESTMENT SALES AND PAYOFFS\nOn October 25, 2017, the Company received a full repayment at par on its $0.8 million senior secured debt investment in Flight Engine Leasing V, LLC (\"FLV\"). The Company generated an internal rate of return (\"IRR\") of 15.5% on its debt investment in FLV. IRR is the rate of return that makes the net present value of all cash flows into or from the investment equal to zero, and is calculated based on the amount of each cash flow received or invested by the Company and the day it was invested or received.\nOn October 31, 2017, the Company received a full repayment at par on its $0.1 million senior secured debt investment in Flight Engine Leasing III, LLC (\"FLIII\"). The Company generated an IRR of 16.6% on its investment in FLIII.\nOn November 20, 2017, the Company received a full repayment at par on its $3.7 million senior secured debt investment in Chemical Information Services, LLC (\"CIS\"). The Company generated an IRR of 14.5% on its investment in CIS.\nOn December 28, 2017, the Company received a full repayment at par on its $4.6 million senior secured debt investment in Multicultural Radio Broadcasting, Inc (\"MRBI\"). The Company generated an IRR of 12.4% on its investment in MRBI.\nThe Company's Chairman and CEO, Joseph Jolson, made the following comments: “I apologize for the delay in reporting our fourth quarter 2017 results. As a co-founder and Chairman of Harvest Capital Credit, I have been pleased to be a small part of the company’s success during most of the past five years. Recently, I was asked to take on the additional role as CEO and to help position the company for future growth. As part of the year-end closing process, we determined that certain internal controls needed to be modified to improve the timely reporting of current portfolio developments to our finance and administrative services department. In addition, it had become increasingly clear that our A-Z approach for our investment staff was limiting their ability to consistently focus on originating attractive risk adjusted return opportunities. As a result of that assessment, we identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting as disclosed in our Form 10-K, and have restructured our operations into three functional areas: Business Development, Portfolio Management, and Finance and Administration.\nRich Buckanavage, who is routinely our largest originator, will lead our business development efforts and will be supported by four investment professionals. Jim Fowler, who I have worked with for most of the past 20 years, has accepted the role of Chief Investment Officer of Harvest Capital Credit to oversee our portfolio management efforts. In addition, we are scheduled to complete our planned transition of our finance and investment administration functions to Bill Alvarez and his team in New York. I want to publicly thank our CFO, Craig Kitchin, and our CCO, Renee Lefebvre, for all their efforts during the past seven years in helping to make this business a success.\nLooking forward, I am excited about the opportunity to help grow Harvest Capital Credit into one of the leading providers of financing solutions to the lower middle market. We have a strong base and are well positioned for growth with excess capacity of more than $30 million to put to work by year end 2018. We are evaluating the recently passed BDC reform legislation, which could allow us to grow assets to approximately $200 million without raising new equity capital under certain conditions.”\nCREDIT QUALITY\nThe Company employs various risk management and monitoring tools to categorize and assess its investments. No less frequently than quarterly, the Company applies an investment risk rating system which uses a five-level numeric scale. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating:\nInvestment Rating 1 is used for investments that are performing above expectations, and whose risks remain favorable compared to the expected risk at the time of the original investment. Investment Rating 2 is used for investments that are performing within expectations and whose risks remain neutral compared to the expected risk at the time of the original investment. All new loans are initially rated 2. Investment Rating 3 is used for investments that are performing below expectations and that require closer monitoring, but where no loss of return or principal is expected. Portfolio companies with a rating of 3 may be out of compliance with financial covenants. Investment Rating 4 is used for investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since the original investment. These investments are often in workout. Investments with a rating of 4 are those for which there is an increased possibility of some loss of return but no loss of principal is expected. Investment Rating 5 is used for investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since the original investment. These investments are almost always in workout. Investments with a rating of 5 are those for which some loss of return and principal is expected.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the weighted average risk rating of the debt investments in the Company's portfolio was 2.23, up from 2.02 in the previous quarter. Also, as of December 31, 2017, eight of the Company’s twenty-four debt investments were rated 1, ten investments were rated 2, three investments were rated 3, two investments were rated 4 and one investment was rated 5. As of December 31, 2017, one investment was on non-accrual status.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had $11.5 million of cash and restricted cash and $38.3 million of undrawn capacity on its $55.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility. The credit facility is secured by all of the Company’s assets and has an accordion feature that allows the size of the facility to increase up to $85.0 million.\nAdditionally, the Company holds four syndicated loans totaling $10.5 million at fair value as of December 31, 2017. These investments could be sold and the proceeds re-invested in our core lower-middle market strategy, as attractive opportunities arise.\nSIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS SUBSEQUENT TO DECEMBER 31, 2017\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company repurchased 64,897 shares of its common stock at an average price of $10.75 per share.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company increased its debt investment in Infinite Care, LLC by $0.4 million through two over-advances on its revolver commitment. The Company also took control of the borrower's equity after accelerating the debt and auctioning the borrower’s equity in a public sale. The Company bid a portion of its outstanding debt to gain control of the portfolio company. Upon completion of this process, the Company converted $2.0 million of its debt investment in the borrower to preferred equity.\nOn January 24, 2018, the Company made a $7.0 million senior secured debt investment and a $0.2 million preferred equity investment in Coastal Screen and Rail, LLC. The debt investment consists of a $6.5 million term loan and a $0.5 million revolver. The term loan carries an interest rate of 10.50% cash plus 1.50% PIK. The revolver carries an interest rate of LIBOR + 8.00% on funded balances.\nOn February 8, 2018, the Company declared monthly distributions of $0.095 per share payable on each of February 28, 2018, March 27, 2018 and April 26, 2018.\nOn March 7, 2018, the Company received a full repayment at par plus a 2% prepayment fee on its $2.0 million junior secured debt investment in Turning Point Brands, Inc. The Company generated a 15.0% IRR on its investment.\nOn March 12, 2018, the Company received $3.9 million for its $4.6 million debt and $0.3 million equity investments in WorkWell, LLC. The Company also entered into a royalty agreement with the sponsor allowing it to recover up to another $0.1 million on its investment subject to certain future events. The Company generated a combined IRR of 5.2% on its debt and equity investments in WorkWell, LLC.\nOn March 28, 2018, our board of directors appointed Joseph A. Jolson (Chairman of our board of directors) as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, effective as of such date. Mr. Jolson succeeds Richard P. Buckanavage, who stepped down from his positions as Chief Executive Officer and President on March 28, 2018, to assume the role of Managing Director - Head of Business Development, effective as of such date. In addition, Mr. Buckanavage continues to serve as a principal and member of the investment committee of our investment adviser, along with Mr. Jolson. On March 28, 2018, our board of directors also appointed James Fowler as the Chief Investment Officer of the Company. Mr. Fowler is also a member of the investment committee at our investment adviser. The addition of Mr. Fowler strengthens the investment team at our investment adviser following the resignation of Ryan T. Magee, a Vice President of the Company and a principal of our investment adviser, on March 8, 2018.\nIn addition, on March 28, 2018, as part of the previously announced process initiated by the Company to transition the provision of administrative services to the Company from JMP Credit Advisors to HCAP Advisors, our investment adviser, the board accepted the resignations of Craig R. Kitchin, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer and Secretary, and Renee Lefebvre, the Company’s Chief Compliance Officer, each effective as of April 2, 2018. Mr. Kitchin and Ms. Lefebvre are employed by JMP Credit Advisors. To succeed Mr. Kitchin and Ms. Lefebvre, our board of directors appointed William Alvarez as Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, and Secretary, effective as of April 2, 2018. The resignations of Mr. Kitchin and Ms. Lefebvre are not related to the events disclosed in the Company's Rule 12b-25 filing on March 15, 2018.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nThe Company will host a conference call on Monday, April 2, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its fourth quarter results.

Per share totals might not foot due to rounding. The purpose of core net investment income is to present net investment income without the effect of certain non-recurring charges, without the effect of incentive fees related to items not included in net investment income, and without the effect of any excise taxes related to realized capital gains and losses. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, this resulted in excluding the non-recurring charges related to the Company's redemption of its 2020 Notes. During this period, in conjunction with the redemption of its 2020 Notes, the Company expensed the unamortized deferred finance costs related to the 2020 Notes that were redeemed and recorded this as a loss on extinguishment of debt. Additionally, the Company was required to give the note holders a 30 day notice period before redeeming the 2020 Notes. As such, the Company had twice the amount of debt on its balance sheet for 30 days than it otherwise would have had and incurred additional interest expense as a result. The cost of these two items has been added to net investment income in the calculation of core net investment income.\n© 2018 Harvest Capital Credit Corporation\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180402005405/en/\nInvestor & Media Relations\nHarvest Capital Credit Corporation\nCraig Kitchin, 678-392-3150\nChief Financial Officer\nckitchin@harvestcaps.com\nSource: Harvest Capital Credit Corporation",
