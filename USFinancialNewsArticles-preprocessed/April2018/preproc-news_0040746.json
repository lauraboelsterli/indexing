    "text": "April 20 (Reuters) - Japan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd is considering raising its cash-and-stock bid for London-listed drug maker Shire Plc to approximately 47 pounds ($66) per share or more, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.\nTakeda is still finalizing its latest offer, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. On Thursday, the companies disclosed that Shire had rejected Takeda’s third indicative bid of 46.50 pounds per share.\nTakeda and Shire did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
