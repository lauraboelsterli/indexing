Photo: The Wall Street Journal \nOch-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC , the New York hedge fund, appointed Thomas Sipp Chief Financial Officer, effective no later than June 1, 2018. Mr. Sipp will succeed Alesia J. Haas, the company’s current CFO, who resigned from her post and will remain with the company through June 1, 2018. Mr. Sipp joins from Magis Partners Ltd., where he served as managing partner for wealth management products. Prior to his time at Magis Partners, he held several senior executive positions at Credit Suisse Group AG, including CFO and chief operating officer for the bank’s asset management division.\nMr. Sipp will receive annual base compensation of $500,000, payable in equal quarterly installments, and will be eligible to receive an annual bonus, the amount of which shall be determined by the compensation committee and the company’s chief executive officer. Mr. Sipp will also receive a one-time sign-on grant of 3 million Class A restricted share units under the company’s 2013 incentive plan, which will vest in three equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date, according to a filing. \nSanofi SA , the French pharmaceuticals company, said its CFO Jérôme Contamine intends to retire later this year. Mr. Contamine will work with the company on finding a replacement and assist with the transition once a successor has been named. He was appointed as CFO in 2009.\nShare this: CFO MOVES Previous The Morning Ledger: Companies Set to Spend on Higher Dividends, Share Buybacks Next The Morning Ledger: Consumer-Goods Companies Struggle to Raise Prices  ",
