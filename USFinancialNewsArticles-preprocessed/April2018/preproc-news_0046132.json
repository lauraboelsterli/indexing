Under the deal, Chase will be renamed as SBM Bank Kenya Ltd.\nIn January, Kenya central bank Governor Patrick Njoroge said they had not found a solution for the remaining 25 percent of Chase Bank’s assets and liabilities.\nLi said SBM would retain Chase’s property and staff and said the bank would target small and medium sized business seeking to trade with Asian markets.\n“This marks also the positive contribution of SBM to regional financial development as Mauritius and Kenya establish themselves as strategic hubs in the Asia-Africa corridor,” Li told Reuters.\nThe agreement is subject to approval from regulators in Mauritius and Kenya, Li said.\nSBM shares closed up 0.3 percent at 7.60 rupees on the Mauritius bourse on Tuesday.\nIn November 2016, SBM Holdings acquired Kenya’s Fidelity Bank for a token payment of 100 shillings ($0.97) and injected 1.45 billion shillings of fresh capital into it.
