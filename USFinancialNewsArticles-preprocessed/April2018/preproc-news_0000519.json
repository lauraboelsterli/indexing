    "text": "(Reuters) - Shares of music-streaming service Spotify Technology SA began trading at $165.90 and hit a high of $169 during their debut session on Tuesday, well above the “reference price” of $132 set by the New York Stock Exchange late on Monday. They last traded at $151.26.\nThe Spotify logo is displayed after the stock began selling as a direct listing on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, U.S., April 3, 2018. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson The Swedish company skipped a conventional initial public offering (IPO) and listed shares directly on the NYSE with few of the safeguards provided by investment banks that would normally manage the process.\nHere is how technology companies have fared on their market debut and following recent IPOs:\nCompany IPO Date IPO Price First-day Pct change\npct change since IPO\nSnap 28-Feb-17 $17 +44% -17%\nMuleSoft 16-Mar-17 $17 +46% +159%\nCloudera 27-Apr-17 $15 +21% +47%\nBlue Apron 28-Jun-17 $10 0% -82%\nRoku 27-Sep-17 $14 +68% +111%\nDropbox 22-Mar-18 $21 +36% +46%\nReporting by Noel Randewich and April Joyner; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli and Bill Rigby\n ",
