    "text": "April 26, 2018 / 11:34 AM / Updated 27 minutes ago Former Brazil finance minister Palocci strikes plea deal - O Globo Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nBRASILIA (Reuters) - Former Brazilian Finance Minister Antonio Palocci has struck a plea deal with federal police, newspaper O Globo reported on Thursday, raising the stakes in a corruption scandal engulfing high-ranking politicians and prominent businessmen.\nRepresentatives for Palocci and the federal police were not immediately available for comment.\nPalocci served as Finance Minister under former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who is currently serving time for taking bribes, and as chief of staff under Lula’s successor Dilma Rousseff.\nHe was arrested in September 2016 and sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and money laundering.\nHis testimony could fuel new investigations and lead to arrests, O Globo said, citing an unnamed source close to the matter.
