    "text": "8 COMMENTS One group of hedge funds has long pitched the idea they can protect investors and even prosper when markets fall sharply. But when volatility returned to markets recently, these funds failed to capitalize.\nThe reason: Funds kept betting markets would fall further and were caught out when they rebounded, missing an opportunity to profit after years of losing money in the bull market, according to portfolio managers.\nThe woes of these “tail-risk” funds, designed to benefit from market turmoil, show that in a month when many investors lost massive sums betting against volatility, wagers on it proved tricky too.\nA CBOE Eurekahedge index of tail-risk funds fell 0.3% in February, even though the month was full of such sudden slumps: The S&P 500 lost 4.1% on Feb. 5 and 3.8% on Feb. 8, while the CBOE Volatility Index or VIX —the market’s so-called “fear gauge”—recorded its biggest percentage jump ever.\nThe VIX is now at around 20, after a year and a half of hovering barely above 10, as central banks exit years of unprecedented stimulus, trade spats escalate and lawmakers threaten to clamp down on technology giants. Last week, U.S. stocks recorded their first quarterly loss since 2015.\nLondon-based 36 South Capital Advisors pitches funds designed to “substantially outperform in periods of extreme market movement and volatility,” according to its website. Its Kohinoor Core Fund gained 0.5% in February after losing 26.1% last year, according to numbers sent to investors and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, leaving it down 2.6% in 2018. The firm’s Series Three Fund, down 8.6% last year, rose 0.2% in February. Returns for March aren’t yet available.\n“February might be a tail event for some people, but it wasn’t in our minds. A minimum of 30% down is what I’d consider a tail event,” said 36 South CEO Jerry Haworth, adding that performance was in line with the firm’s expectations.\nParis-based Amundi’s $1.1 billion Absolute Volatility Euro Equities fund gained 1.7% last month, having lost 14.4% last year. Gilbert Keskin, head of volatility and convertibles at Amundi, said the VIX’s February surge “really was a tail event,” but that the fund was exposed to longer-term volatility through options and was unable to lock in most of its gains.\nTail-risk funds typically purchase options that pay out if market falls, but otherwise expire worthless. Versions of these strategies that bet on extreme and seemingly unlikely catastrophes are dubbed “black swan” funds.\nThe CBOE Volatility Index pit in the CBOE Global Markets building in February.

But it is hard.\nVineer Bhansali, who runs LongTail Alpha LLC, said some of his tail-risk strategies finished February up more than 30%. Clark Capital Management Group’s volatility strategy was the best performer during the large February selloffs, according to mutual-fund tracker Morningstar and is up 15% in the past month.\nJeróme Teilteche, Unigestion’s head of cross-asset solutions, said the performance of his anticrisis strategies—which included a prescient bet that the VIX would move by more than the S&P 500 in a selloff—had remained flat for the year.\n“Profits are fleeting and when they are there you have to capitalize on them,” said Sean Clark, chief investment officer at Clark Capital Management.\nForecasting the timing of equity routs and rebounds is nearly impossible, so tail-fund managers stress that their services should make up less than 10% of a client’s portfolio, for the same reason that investors hold bonds. There is a catch: Bonds are less reliable as hedges—they didn’t do so well during February’s rout—but offer steady returns, whereas betting on volatility costs money.\nSomeone who invested $1 a year ago in Mr. Clark’s successful volatility fund would be getting back less than 60 cents today.\nYet, analysts make the analogy with the house insurance market: Insurers face the risk of large payouts when the house catches fire—like happened to inverse VIX products in February—but those insured still tend to lose money over time.\n“The main reason why some people get frustrated is that they see this as a speculative trade,” Mr. Bhansali said. “The purpose is to hedge.”\nWrite to Laurence Fletcher at laurence.fletcher@wsj.com and Jon Sindreu at jon.sindreu@wsj.com",
