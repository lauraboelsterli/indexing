    "text": "JACKSONVILLE, FL, April 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nShepherd’s Finance, LLC (“Shepherd’s” or the “Company”) announced its operating results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n2017 Financial Highlights\n● Earnings Growth – Net income increased approximately $0.3 million, or 51%, to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to net income of approximately $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n● Interest Income Growth – Interest and fees on loans increased approximately $2.2 million, or 60%, to approximately $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to interest and fees on loans of approximately $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase resulted from increased average loan volume.\n● Loan Growth – Loans receivable, net increased approximately $9.9 million, or 49.5%, to approximately $30.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to loans receivable, net of approximately $20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n● Asset Quality Improvement – Foreclosed assets decreased approximately $1.8 million to $1.0 million, or 2.8% of total assets, as of December 31, 2017, compared to foreclosed assets of approximately $2.8 million, or 11.2% of total assets as of December 31, 2016.\n“During 2017 we saw substantial growth at Shepherd’s Finance,” commented Daniel M. Wallach, CEO of Shepherd’s Finance, LLC. “Our 2017 interest income and net income were new annual records for the Company. In addition, for the last seven years since we commenced our initial fixed rate subordinated notes offering, we have delivered consecutive positive annual net income along with consistent growth in our interest and fee income.” Along with our financial growth, we made the decision to invest in our team by adding our Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President of Sales, and Vice President of Administrative Operations and Product Development,” continued Mr. Wallach.\nResults of Operations\n● Net interest income totaled approximately $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to approximately $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase of approximately $1.2 million resulted primarily from the increase in our weighted average outstanding loan asset balance of approximately $9.0 million to approximately $27.3 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to approximately $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n● Non-interest expense increased approximately $0.9 million to approximately $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from December 31, 2016. The increase in non-interest expense related primarily to our payroll costs as we hired a number of new employees.\nBalance Sheet Management\n● We had approximately $3.5 million in cash as of December 31, 2017, compared to approximately $1.6 million as of December 31, 2016.\n● Loan receivables, net totaled approximately $30.0 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to approximately $20.1 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase primarily included approximately $12.0 million in commercial loans offset by a decrease in real estate development loans of approximately $1.3 million.\n● Notes payable unsecured, net totaled approximately $16.9 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to approximately $12.0 million as of December 31, 2016. A significant portion of our notes payable unsecured, net was from our public notes offering, constituting approximately $14.1 million and $11.2 million of the total notes payable unsecured as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We expect our notes payable unsecured balance to increase as we raise funds in our public notes offering.\n● Notes payable secured totaled approximately $11.6 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to approximately $7.3 million as of December 31, 2016. A significant portion of our notes payable secured was from our two loan purchase and sale agreements with Builder Finance, Inc. and S.K. Funding, LLC. The principal amount of loans sold under our purchase and sale agreements totaled approximately $8.2 million and $7.3 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2017.\nNotable 2018 Events to Date\n● Appointment of New Chief Financial Officer – Shepherd’s previously announced that it had appointed Catherine Loftin as Chief Financial Officer on January 2, 2018.

From 1997 to 2002, Ms. Bedford was with Liberty Savings Bank as Assistant Vice President, Construction Closing Manager and was responsible for underwriting.\n● Announcement of an Interest Rate Increase in the Subordinated Notes Program - Shepherd’s announced the following increases in interest rates for its public notes offering, effective as of March 6, 2018:\nMaturity\n(Duration) Annual\nInterest\nRate Annual\nEffective\nYield (i) Effective\nYield to Maturity (ii) 12 Months 9 % 9.38 % 9.38 % 18 Months 10 % 10.47 % 16.11 % 30 Months 10.5 % 11.02 % 29.87 % 48 Months 11 % 11.57 % 54.96 %\n(i) The Annual Effective Yield is determined by taking the Annual Interest Rate as a decimal and dividing it by 12 for a monthly rate, then taking that rate plus 1 and multiplying that by itself 11 more times, then subtracting the one back off and converting back to a percentage. For instance, for an Annual Interest Rate of 7.50%, we take .075/12 which is .00625 plus 1 which is 1.0776, and then multiply 1.0776 by itself 11 more times which yields 1.0776, then subtracting off the 1, leaving .0776, and finally converting to a percentage, which gives us an Annual Effective Yield of 7.76%.\n(ii) The Effective Yield to Maturity is determined by taking the Annual Interest Rate as a decimal and dividing it by 12 for a monthly rate, then taking that rate plus 1 and multiplying that by itself by (the total number of months of the investment minus one) times, then subtracting the one back off and converting back to a percentage. For instance, for a 48-month investment with an Annual Interest Rate of 10.0%, we take .100/12 which is .008333 plus 1 which is 1.00833, and then multiply 1.00833 by itself 47 more times which yields 1.4894, then subtracting off the 1, leaving .4894, and finally converting to a percentage, which gives us an Effective Yield to Maturity of 48.94%.\nAbout Shepherd’s Finance, LLC\nShepherd’s Finance, LLC is headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida and is focused on commercial lending to participants in the residential construction and development industry.
