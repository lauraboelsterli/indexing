    "text": "0 COMMENTS The dollar crept higher against a broad range of currencies Monday, as a sharp drop in equities sent investors into haven assets.\nThe WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, was up less than 0.1% at 83.76 in late afternoon New York trading.\nSliding technology shares and rising global trade tensions put pressure on major indexes, with the S&P 500 down 2.2%. The steep decline benefited assets that tend to draw buying when markets turn rocky, such as the dollar, Japanese yen and gold.\nThe dollar was down 0.3% against the yen at ¥105.91. The euro fell 0.2% to $1.2303.\nHaven buying in recent weeks has helped stem a dollar decline that left the U.S. currency with a 2.6% loss in the first quarter. The WSJ Dollar Index is down 7.3% over the past 12 months.\nInvestors on Monday also pulled back bets on emerging-market currencies, which some view as comparatively risky. The dollar was up 0.3% against the Mexican peso at 18.23, while also gaining against the Russian ruble, South African rand and other currencies.\nGenerally, there is “marked erosion of the bullish emerging-market sentiment that prevailed at the end of last year [and] early this year,” analysts at Société Générale said in a note to clients.\nInvestors’ key concerns are trade conflicts between the U.S. and other countries and higher interest rates in the U.S., the report said.\nApproximately 20% of the bank’s clients are bearish on emerging markets, compared with nearly unanimous bullishness late last year, Société Générale said.\nU.S. government bonds, meanwhile, were little changed as the decline in stock prices led some investors to seek safety in Treasury debt.\nThe yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note declined for a fourth consecutive session to 2.732% from 2.741% Thursday. Yields fall when bond prices rise.\nWrite to Ira Iosebashvili at ira.iosebashvili@wsj.com\nCorrections & Amplifications\nThe yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note declined for a fourth consecutive session to 2.732% from 2.741% Thursday. Yields fall when bond prices rise. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the direction. (April 3, 2018)",
