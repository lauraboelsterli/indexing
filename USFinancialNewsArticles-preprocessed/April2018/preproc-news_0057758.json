General Motors President Dan Ammann speaks during GM's press conference at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., January 16, 2018. REUTERS/Rebecca Cook\n“Over the last few months, over the last few weeks a lot of very good progress has been made,” GM President Dan Ammann said in a meeting with South Korean ruling party lawmakers.\nOn Monday, the Detroit carmaker reached a preliminary deal with its South Korean labour union, winning concessions on pay and bonuses. That led the company to drop a plan to consider filing for bankruptcy. Reporting by Jane Chung; writing by Ju-min Park; Editing by Edwina Gibbs",
