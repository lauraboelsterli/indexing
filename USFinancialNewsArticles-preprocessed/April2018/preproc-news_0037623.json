    "text": "Record earnings of $13.6 million in the first quarter 2018, an increase of $3.7 million, or 37.7% compared to the first quarter 2017 Expanded return on average assets to 1.48% compared to 1.18% in the first quarter 2017 Increased quarterly stockholder dividend 30% to $0.1625 per share\nDENVER, Guaranty Bancorp (Nasdaq:GBNK) (“we”, “our” or “the Company”), a community bank holding company based in Colorado, today announced first quarter 2018 net income of $13.6 million, or $0.47 per basic and diluted common share, compared to net income of $9.8 million, or $0.35 per basic and diluted common share, in the first quarter 2017. The $3.7 million increase in first quarter 2018 net income as compared to the same quarter in 2017 was primarily attributable to higher net interest income resulting from higher average loan balances and increased loan yields and a lower tax rate due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, partially offset by higher noninterest expense resulting from the acquisitions of Castle Rock Bank Holding Company (“Castle Rock”) in late 2017 and Wagner Wealth Management, LLC (“Wagner”) early in the first quarter 2018. In addition, the first quarter 2018 increase in noninterest income was favorably impacted by a $0.3 million gain on sale of a building. The first quarter 2018 net income was $5.0 million greater than fourth quarter 2017 net income due mostly to higher net interest income, lower noninterest expense due to merger-related expenses incurred in the fourth quarter 2017, and reduced tax expense.\n“We achieved another strong quarter highlighted by record earnings of $13.6 million in the first quarter 2018, an increase of $3.7 million, or 38% compared to the first quarter 2017,” said Paul W. Taylor, President and Chief Executive Officer of Guaranty Bancorp. “We grew loans in the first quarter by $40.1 million, or 6% on an annualized basis and deposits increased by $90.1 million, which represented annualized growth of 12%.”\nTaylor continued, “Our earnings growth came as a result of balance sheet growth and increased fee income, primarily investment management and trust fees, which increased 0.8 million or 50.9% compared to the fourth quarter 2017. Our robust performance has enabled us to continue to provide solid returns to our stockholders as demonstrated by the increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.1625 per share from $0.125 in 2017, an increase of 30%. Our strong first quarter results, together with a continued healthy Colorado economy, have us well positioned as we enter the second quarter.”\nKey Financial Measures\nIncome Statement\nThree Months Ended March 31, December 31, March 31, 2018 2017 2017 (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Net income $ 13,557 $ 8,605 $ 9,840 Operating earnings (1) 13,440 11,885 9,832 Earnings per common share - diluted 0.47 0.30 0.35 Earnings per common share - diluted - operating (1) 0.46 0.41 0.35 Return on average assets 1.48 % 0.95 % 1.18 % Return on average assets - operating (1) 1.47 % 1.31 % 1.18 % Return on average equity 13.45 % 8.59 % 11.17 % Return on average equity - operating (1) 13.33 % 11.86 % 11.16 % Net interest margin 3.77 % 3.77 % 3.65 % Net interest margin, fully tax equivalent 3.84 % 3.89 % 3.76 % Efficiency ratio - tax equivalent (2) 52.91 % 49.79 % 55.33 % Average cost of interest-bearing liabilities (including noninterest-bearing deposits) 0.52 % 0.44 % 0.43 % Average cost of deposits (including noninterest-bearing deposits) 0.31 % 0.28 % 0.23 % Assets under management $ 1,465 $ 866 $ 821 (1) See reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measurement in \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" later in this document. (2) The efficiency ratio equals noninterest expense adjusted to exclude amortization of intangible assets, prepayment penalties on long-term debt, impairment of long-lived assets, litigation-related settlements and merger related expenses, divided by the sum of tax equivalent net interest income and tax equivalent noninterest income. To calculate tax equivalent net interest income and noninterest income, the interest earned on tax exempt loans and investment securities and the income earned on bank-owned life insurance have been adjusted to reflect the amount that would have been earned had these investments been subject to normal income taxation.

The increase in interest income was mostly the result of a $316.5 million increase in average earning assets in the first quarter 2018 compared to the same quarter in 2017. The increase in interest expense in the first quarter 2018, compared to the same quarter in 2017, was primarily due to a $0.7 million increase in interest expense on deposits and a $0.3 million increase in interest expense on FHLB borrowings. Interest expense on deposits increased in the first quarter 2018, compared to the same quarter in 2017, due to a $207.9 million increase in average interest bearing deposit balances and a twelve basis point increase in the cost of deposits. The Company acquired $71.1 million in loans and $128.4 million in deposits in the October 2017 acquisition of Castle Rock.\nThe $0.3 million increase in net interest income in the first quarter 2018 compared to the fourth quarter 2017 was comprised of a $1.0 million increase in interest income partially offset by a $0.7 million increase in interest expense. The $1.0 million increase in interest income in the first quarter 2018 compared to the fourth quarter 2017 was mostly due to a $105.5 million increase in average earning assets. Accretion of discount on acquired loans was $1.0 million in the first quarter 2018, compared to $1.4 million in the fourth quarter 2017 and $0.8 million in the first quarter 2017. The $0.7 million increase in interest expense in the first quarter 2018 compared to the fourth quarter 2017 was mostly due to a $126.0 million increase in average interest-bearing liabilities and a ten basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.\nNoninterest Income\nThe following table presents noninterest income as of the dates indicated:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 (In thousands) Noninterest income: Deposit service and other fees $ 3,321 $ 3,546 $ 3,280 Investment management and trust 2,298 1,523 1,521 Increase in cash surrender value of life insurance 670 675 595 Gain on sale of securities - 80 - Gain on sale of SBA loans 231 285 381 Other 450 461 625 Total noninterest income $ 6,970 $ 6,570 $ 6,402 First quarter 2018 noninterest income increased $0.4 million compared to the fourth quarter 2017, primarily due to a $0.8 million increase in investment management and trust income. The increase in investment management and trust income was primarily a result of the January 2018 purchase of the assets under management of Wagner. At March 31, 2018 assets under management were $1.5 billion compared to $866 million at December 31, 2017 and $821 million at March 31, 2017.\nCompared to the first quarter 2017, noninterest income increased $0.6 million in the first quarter 2018, primarily resulting from an increase in investment management and trust income due to the increase in assets under management, described above. Partially offsetting the increase in investment management and trust income was a $0.3 million gain on sale of the Company’s $2.0 million credit card loan portfolio, included in other noninterest income in the table above, in the first quarter 2017.\nNoninterest Expense\nThe following table presents noninterest expense as of the dates indicated:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 (In thousands) Noninterest expense: Salaries and employee benefits $ 12,903 $ 11,853 $ 11,926 Occupancy expense 1,738 1,724 1,552 Furniture and equipment 1,060 1,004 945 Amortization of intangible assets 912 776 649 Other real estate owned, net 39 - 68 Insurance and assessments 697 671 706 Professional fees 1,091 974 974 Impairment of long-lived assets - 170 190 Other general and administrative 3,506 6,784 3,519 Total noninterest expense $ 21,946 $ 23,956 $ 20,529 First quarter 2018 noninterest expense decreased $2.0 million compared to the fourth quarter 2017, mostly due to a $3.2 million decrease in merger-related expenses (included in other general and administrative expense in the table above), partially offset by a $1.1 million increase in salaries and employee benefit expense. The decline in the merger-related expenses in the first quarter 2018 compared with the fourth quarter 2017 was a result of expenses incurred in relation to the October 2017 Castle Rock acquisition during the fourth quarter 2017. The increase in salaries and employee benefits expense in the first quarter 2018 compared to the fourth quarter 2017 was related to an increase in employees from the Castle Rock and Wagner acquisitions and also the timing of the annual payroll tax cycle.\nCompared to the first quarter 2017, noninterest expense increased $1.4 million in the first quarter 2018, primarily resulting from a $1.0 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense and a $0.3 million increase in amortization of intangible assets. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was related to growth in employees from the Castle Rock and Wagner acquisitions, in addition to a $0.6 million increase in incentive compensation. The increase in intangible asset amortization in the first quarter 2018 compared to the first quarter 2017 was a direct result of the intangible assets added in the Castle Rock and Wagner acquisitions.\nTax Expense\nThe Company’s first quarter 2018 income tax expense was favorably impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed into law in December 2017. This new tax law reduced the statutory federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, beginning on January 1, 2018. The Company’s first quarter 2018 income tax expense and effective tax rate were $3.4 million and 19.9%, respectively, compared to income tax expense and an effective tax rate of $4.2 million and 29.9% in the first quarter 2017. In addition, the Company’s first quarter 2018 tax expense benefited from the vesting of 107,786 shares of restricted stock with a weighted average grant price of $15.41 and a weighted average fair value at vesting of $27.71. The increase in the value of these shares between the grant date and the vesting date resulted in the direct benefit to tax expense of approximately $327,000 in the first quarter 2018. In the absence of the direct benefit to tax expense from first quarter 2018 restricted stock vestings the Company’s effective tax rate would have been 21.9%. Comparatively, a direct tax benefit of $511,000 from the vesting of 123,407 shares of restricted stock reduced first quarter 2017 income tax expense, in the absence of this benefit the first quarter 2017 effective tax rate would have been 33.6%.\nBalance Sheet\nMarch 31, December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, 2018 2017 2017 2017 2017 (Dollars in thousands) Total assets $ 3,721,651 $ 3,698,890 $ 3,510,046 $ 3,403,852 $ 3,399,651 Average assets, quarter-to-date 3,714,655 3,603,552 3,423,224 3,404,109 3,374,153 Total loans, net of deferred fees and costs 2,847,465 2,807,388 2,661,866 2,578,472 2,570,750 Total deposits 3,031,714 2,941,627 2,898,060 2,763,623 2,765,630 Equity ratio - GAAP 11.03 % 10.95 % 10.69 % 10.80 % 10.56 % Tangible common equity ratio (1) 8.93 % 8.99 % 8.88 % 8.91 % 8.65 % (1) See reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measurement in \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" later in this document.

In addition to contractual loan principal payments and maturities, the first quarter 2018 included $62.3 million in early payoffs related to our borrowers selling their assets, $7.0 million in loan pay-downs related to fluctuations in loan balances of existing customers, and $3.5 million in loan payoffs related to our strategic decision not to match certain financing terms offered by competitors.\nBalance Sheet (continued)\nThe following table sets forth the amounts of deposits outstanding at the dates indicated:\nMarch 31, December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, 2018 2017 2017 2017 2017 (In thousands) Noninterest-bearing demand $ 973,172 $ 939,550 $ 924,361 $ 876,043 $ 868,189 Interest-bearing demand and NOW 849,741 813,882 866,309 811,639 821,518 Money market 531,818 527,621 502,400 475,656 489,921 Savings 210,376 201,687 183,366 183,200 178,157 Time 466,607 458,887 421,624 417,085 407,845 Total deposits $ 3,031,714 $ 2,941,627 $ 2,898,060 $ 2,763,623 $ 2,765,630 At March 31, 2018, total deposits were $3.0 billion, an increase of $90.1 million compared to December 31, 2017 and an increase of $266.1 million compared to March 31, 2017.

As a result of the Castle Rock transaction, the Company acquired $1.6 million of nonperforming loans and $0.8 million of other real estate owned. At March 31, 2018, performing troubled debt restructurings were $18.4 million, compared to $18.1 million at December 31, 2017 and $23.2 million at March 31, 2017. The year-over-year decrease in performing troubled debt restructurings was primarily due to the payoff of a $9.4 million out-of-state loan syndication during the third quarter 2017, partially offset by the modification of a single commercial loan during the fourth quarter 2017.\nNet charge offs were $0.1 million during the first quarter 2018, compared to net recoveries of $0.1 million during the fourth quarter 2017 and net charge-offs of $0.1 million in the first quarter 2017. During the first quarter 2018, the Bank recorded a $0.2 million provision for loan losses, compared to a $0.3 million provision in the fourth quarter 2017 and an immaterial provision in the first quarter 2017. The Bank considered recoveries, historical charge-offs, the level of nonperforming loans, loan growth and other factors when determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the resulting amount of loan loss provision to be recognized during the quarter.\nShares Outstanding\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had 29,297,002 shares of voting common stock outstanding, of which 440,787 shares were in the form of unvested stock awards.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures related to tangible assets, including tangible book value and tangible common equity, and operating earnings adjusted for merger-related expenses, OREO expenses, debt termination expense, impairments of long-lived assets, litigation-related settlements, securities gains and losses, net deferred tax asset write-downs and gains or losses on the sale or disposal of other assets. The Company also discloses the following GAAP profitability metrics alongside the operating earnings equivalent: return on average assets, return on average equity and earnings per share (diluted).\nThe Company discloses these non-GAAP financial measures to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s operational performance and to enhance investors’ overall understanding of the Company’s core financial performance.

These non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP.
