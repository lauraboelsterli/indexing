    "text": "Updated 18 Hours Ago CNBC.com \nInternational Paper : \"You know, the stock has come down big. I kind of regard it as an Amazon play. It's a good trade on world commerce. A lot of people feel world commerce is going to slow down, a lot of different crosscurrents because of tariffs. I say IP, at these prices, is a very good buy. I'd love to see [the CEO,] Mr. [Mark] Sutton come back.\" \nGrubHub, Inc. : \"I've been riding this for a long time, and I've read a couple of downgrades and I am getting a little- look, bulls make money, bears make money, but pigs [get slaughtered]. So, no.\" \nSprint Corp. : \"I would swap out into T-Mobile . I think [T-Mobile CEO John] Legere's going to have a better quarter.\" \nLGI Homes : \"Everyone's blasting the homebuilders because of higher rates and they're very low because of lumber. I have to tell you, I like Lennar . I saw [Lennar CEO] Stuart Miller, [who's] retiring and that's one of my faves. I also like Toll Brothers .\" \nAcadia Pharmaceuticals : \"We had a big run and I should've said ring the register, but I've got to tell you something, that CNN report was so devastating, I don't want to touch this one now.\" \nPilgrim's Pride Corporation : \"There's so many things wrong with that thing right now, but if you think three to five years out, I'd rather own Tyson than that one, to be honest. I think Tyson's better run.\" \nJ.B. Hunt : \"I thought J.B. Hunt reported a terrific quarter. Other people were saying it was ho-hum. The stock went up. I stick with it.\" \nAlaska Air Group : \"You know, it used to be the best, then they made that acquisition and we haven't really gone back to it. The acquisition was just not great and I can't recommend the stock here.\" \nWinnebago Industries : \"This group trades so, so badly. I mean, I just keep hearing 'glut, glut, glut.' In the last six weeks, glut! I've got to find someone to dispel the glut or I can't push it.\" Watch the full lightning round here: show chapters",
