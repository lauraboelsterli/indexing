    "text": "Amazon leaders were again in the tri-state region as reports indicate the Seattle-based e-commerce giant has representatives touring Newark , N.J. earlier this week.\nWhen asked about the meeting on Thursday, Gov. Phil Murphy declined to comment and wouldn't even confirm whether it took place, according to an NJ.com report . New Jersey gained attention with its proposal because the state offered up to $7 billion in tax credits if it's chosen.\nBut the CEO of the Newark Community Economic Development Corporation, Aisha Glover , confirmed with the news outlet that the visit occurred, though she remained mum on specifics.\n\"The purpose of that meeting was to fine-tune elements included in our pitch and give a first-hand look at the city we hope will be chosen for their second national headquarters,\" Glover said. \"We will make no comment on the views and reactions of the Amazon team in order to respect the integrity of their selection process.\"\nSources told NJ.com the local and state officials who met with Amazon included U.S. Sen. Cory Booker , Newark Mayor Ras Baraka , businessman and philanthropist Ray Chambers , and Murphy.\nSimilar to its stop in Philadelphia and the other cities on the HQ2 shortlist, additional details are sparse.\nRead more from Philadelphia Business Journal: \nIn HQ2 site visits, Amazon focuses on education, tech-talent pipeline\nPhiladelphia beats Boston, San Francisco in attracting skilled workers, analysis finds\nVictims of Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme to receive millions more in compensation \nThe HQ2 team stopped in Philadelphia earlier this year, Mayor Jim Kenney confirmed the visit happened in a March meeting. But little has been shared about what actually occurred while they were in town.\nThe Wall Street Journal said earlier this month education and the tech-talent pipeline have been key. Amazon reportedly asked for breakout sessions on those topics.\nIn Philadelphia, the Navy Yard business campus and two sites in the University City neighborhood are under consideration by the e-commerce and technology giant.",
