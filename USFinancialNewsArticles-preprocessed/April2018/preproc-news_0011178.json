    "text": "Arizona left fielder David Peralta had two hits and two RBIs and left-hander Robbie Ray struck out nine in six innings as the Diamondbacks spoiled the St. Louis Cardinals’ home opener with a 3-1 victory at Busch Stadium on Thursday.\nChris Owings had three hits and scored two runs and Daniel Descalso reached base three times as the Diamondbacks (6-1) tied the best start in franchise history, set in 2000 and tied last year.\nRay (2-0) gave up one run, two hits and walked five in six innings, winning his eighth straight decision dating to Aug. 24, 2017. Ray pitched in St. Louis for the first time since suffering a concussion when he was struck by a line drive on July 28, 2017, causing him to miss a month.\nYadier Molina’s RBI double was one of the two hits off Ray and four relievers for the Cardinals (4-3). Matt Carpenter walked twice, the 100th multi-walk game of his career, and has reached safely in all seven games.\nThe Cardinals, who had homered in their first six games, did not have a hit in the final five innings as Ray, Yoshihisa Hirano, Andrew Chafin, Archie Bradley or Brad Boxberger shut down the St. Louis offense.\nBoxberger recorded his third save with a 1-2-3 ninth.\nDescalso walked to open the second inning off Adam Wainwright, who was activated before the game after opening the season on the disabled list with a hamstring injury, and Owings doubled with one out.\nJarrod Dyson was intentionally walked before Ray hit a sacrifice fly to center. Peralta singled to right to drive in Owings and make it 2-0.\nOwings, starting at second base for the first time this season, singled in the fourth inning, advanced on Ray’s sacrifice bunt and scored on Peralta’s two-out single for a 3-0 lead.\nCarpenter and Jose Martinez walked in the fourth inning before Molina’s one-out double drove in Carpenter. Ray struck out the final two batters of the inning with runners on second and third to preserve a 3-1 lead. That was the Cardinals’ last hit.\nWainwright (0-1) gave up three runs and four hits in 3 2/3 innings. He walked four and struck out three.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
