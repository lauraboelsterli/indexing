    "text": "April 17, 2018 / 2:43 PM / Updated 13 minutes ago CANADA STOCKS-TSX gains on upbeat data, rising energy stocks Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \nApril 17 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index rose on Tuesday, helped by upbeat manufacturing data and as energy shares rose alongside oil prices. \n* At 10:01 a.m. ET (1401 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX Composite Index was up rose 26.57 points, or 0.17 percent, at 15,326.95. Nine of the index’s 10 main sectors were in positive territory. \n* Economic data was upbeat, with Statistics Canada data showing Canadian manufacturing sales rose more than expected in February after two months of declines. \n** Also helping sentiment was improved prospects of a revamped North American Free Trade Agreement. Mexico’s economy minister said, barring some “tiny details,” work was finished on chapters including telecoms, energy and technical barriers to trade. \n* The biggest boost to TSX index came from the energy sector, which climbed 0.2 percent as oil prices ticked higher on rising concerns over the potential for supply disruptions. \n* Shares of Enbridge Inc rose 1.7 percent and was the biggest boost to the energy and overall TSX indexes. \n* The technology sector gained 1.7 percent, helped by Shopify’s near 4-percent increase. \n* Also helping was Open Text’s 3.5 percent rise after activist hedge fund Blue Harbour Group LP CEO said the business information management software company could be acquired. \n* Investors are also braced for the potential of a more upbeat economic assessment by the Bank of Canada meeting this week, at which it is expected to keep interest rate unchanged. \n* Another rate hike is not expected until July. But the central bank’s optimism could raise expectations for a May hike. \n* The heavyweight financials sector advanced 0.2 percent, led gains in the stocks of big banks. \n* On the downside, gold prices lost ground, dipping 0.3 percent amid a revival in risk appetite. \n* The TSX posted eight new 52-week highs and two new lows. Across all Canadian issues there were 11 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows. \n* The largest percentage gainer on the TSX was Alaris Royalty, which rose 5.3 percent, while the largest decliner was Aphria Inc, down 3.4 percent. \n* Among the most active Canadian stocks by volume were Aurora Cannabis, Aphria Inc and Canopy Growth Co. \n* Volume on the TSX index was 24.97 million shares, while the total volume on Tuesday was 37.34 million shares.
