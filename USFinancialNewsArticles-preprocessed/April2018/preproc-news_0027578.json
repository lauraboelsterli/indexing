View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180413005267/en/\nEARNINGS PER SHARE OF $1.68\nNET INCOME OF $4.6 BILLION\nREVENUES OF $18.9 BILLION\nRETURNED $3.1 BILLION OF CAPITAL TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS\nREPURCHASED 30 MILLION COMMON SHARES\nBOOK VALUE PER SHARE OF $71.67\nTANGIBLE BOOK VALUE PER SHARE OF $61.02 5\nCitigroup Inc. today reported net income for the first quarter 2018 of $4.6 billion, or $1.68 per diluted share, on revenues of $18.9 billion. This compared to net income of $4.1 billion, or $1.35 per diluted share, on revenues of $18.4 billion for the first quarter 2017.\nRevenues increased 3% from the prior-year period, driven by growth in both the Institutional Clients Group (ICG) and Global Consumer Banking (GCB), partially offset by lower revenues in Corporate / Other primarily due to the continued wind-down of legacy assets. Net income of $4.6 billion increased 13%, driven by the higher revenues and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher expenses and cost of credit. Earnings per share of $1.68 increased 24% from $1.35 per diluted share in the prior-year period, driven by the growth in net income and a 7% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding.\nCiti CEO Michael Corbat said, “Our first quarter results demonstrate strength and balance across our franchise and position us well for the rest of the year. We grew revenue across both our institutional and consumer businesses and delivered solid, client-led revenue gains in areas we have been investing in such as Citibanamex, TTS, Equities and the Private Bank. In addition to improving Citi’s return on capital, we maintained our focus on also improving Citi’s return of capital. During the quarter, we returned more than $3 billion in capital to common shareholders which helped drive a significant improvement in earnings per share. And we recently submitted our capital plan and believe we remain on track to meet the commitment we outlined at investor day of returning at least $60 billion over the 2017, 2018 and 2019 cycles, subject to regulatory approval.\n“While market conditions have been uneven so far this year, our first quarter results show our ability to deliver for both clients and shareholders and we look forward to sustaining this momentum for the balance of the year,” Mr. Corbat concluded.\nPercentage comparisons throughout this press release are calculated for the first quarter 2018 versus the first quarter 2017, unless otherwise specified.\nCitigroup 1Q'18 4Q'17 1Q'17 QoQ% YoY% ($ in millions, except as otherwise noted)\nGlobal Consumer Banking 8,433 8,449 7,846 - 7% Institutional Clients Group 9,848 8,304 9,319 19% 6% Corporate / Other 591 751 1,201 (21)% (51)% Total Revenues $ 18,872 $ 17,504 $ 18,366 8% 3% Expenses $ 10,925 $ 10,332 $ 10,723 6% 2% Net Credit Losses 1,867 1,880 1,709 (1)% 9% Credit Reserve Build / (Release) (a) (36 ) 165 (77 ) NM 53% Provision for Benefits and Claims 26 28 30 (7)% (13)% Total Cost of Credit $ 1,857 $ 2,073 $ 1,662 (10)% 12% Income from Continuing Operations Before Taxes $ 6,090 $ 5,099 $ 5,981 19% 2% Provision for Income Taxes 1,441 23,864 1,863 (94)% (23)% Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations $ 4,649 $ (18,765 ) $ 4,118 NM 13% Net Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations (7 ) (109 ) (18 ) 94% 61% Non-Controlling Interest 22 19 10 16% NM Citigroup Net Income (Loss) $ 4,620 $ (18,893 ) $ 4,090 NM 13% Adjusted Net Income (b) $ 4,620 $ 3,701 $ 4,090 25% 13% Revenues North America 8,422 8,228 8,467 2% (1)% EMEA 3,167 2,441 2,854 30% 11% Latin America 2,557 2,390 2,336 7% 9% Asia 4,135 3,694 3,508 12% 18% Corporate / Other 591 751 1,201 (21)% (51)% Income from Continuing Operations North America 1,695 (1,031 ) 1,691 NM 0% Adjusted North America (b) 1,695 1,719 1,691 (1)% 0% EMEA 1,113 431 862 NM 29% Latin America 674 498 617 35% 9% Asia 1,241 897 839 38% 48% Corporate / Other (74 ) (19,560 ) 109 NM NM Adjusted Corporate / Other (b) (74 ) 284 109 NM NM EOP Assets ($B) 1,922 1,842 1,821 4% 6% EOP Loans ($B) 673 667 629 1% 7% EOP Deposits ($B) 1,001 960 950 4% 5% Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio 12.1 % 12.4 % 12.8 % Supplementary Leverage Ratio 6.7 % 6.7 % 7.3 % Return on Average Common Equity 9.7 % (37.5 )% 7.4 % Book Value per Share $ 71.67 $ 70.62 $ 75.81 1% (5)% Tangible Book Value per Share $ 61.02 $ 60.16 $ 65.88 1% (7)% Note: Please refer to the Appendices and Footnotes at the end of this press release for additional information.

For additional information, please refer to Appendix A and Footnote 6.\nCitigroup\nCitigroup revenues of $18.9 billion in the first quarter 2018 increased 3%, driven by 7% aggregate growth in GCB and ICG, partially offset by a 51% decrease in Corporate / Other, primarily due to the continued wind-down of legacy assets.\nCitigroup’s operating expenses increased 2% to $10.9 billion in the first quarter 2018, as higher volume-related expenses and investments were partially offset by efficiency savings and the wind-down of legacy assets.\nCitigroup’s cost of credit in the first quarter 2018 was $1.9 billion, a 12% increase, driven by ICG as well as volume growth and seasoning in GCB.\nCitigroup’s net income increased to $4.6 billion in the first quarter 2018, primarily driven by the higher revenues and a lower effective tax rate, which more than offset the higher expenses and cost of credit. Citigroup’s effective tax rate was 24% in the current quarter compared to 31% in the first quarter 2017.\nCitigroup’s allowance for loan losses was $12.4 billion at quarter end, or 1.85% of total loans, compared to $12.0 billion, or 1.93% of total loans, at the end of the prior-year period. Total non-accrual assets declined 20% from the prior-year period to $4.4 billion. Consumer non-accrual loans declined 13% to $2.6 billion and corporate non-accrual loans decreased 29% to $1.7 billion.\nCitigroup’s end of period loans were $673 billion as of quarter end, up 7% from the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation 7 , Citigroup’s end of period loans grew 6%, as 7% aggregate growth in ICG and GCB was partially offset by the continued wind-down of legacy assets in Corporate / Other.\nCitigroup’s end of period deposits were $1.0 trillion as of quarter end, up 5%. In constant dollars, Citigroup deposits were up 3%, as ICG grew 5% and GCB remained largely unchanged.\nCitigroup’s book value per share was $71.67 and tangible book value per share was $61.02, each at quarter end, representing decreases of 5% and 7%, respectively, primarily reflecting the impact of Tax Reform. Sequentially, book value per share and tangible book value per share both increased 1%. At quarter end, Citigroup’s CET1 Capital ratio 8 was 12.1%, down from 12.4% sequentially, due to an increase in risk weighted assets driven by loan growth and client activity, as well as the return of capital to common shareholders, partially offset by net income. Citigroup’s SLR 8 for the first quarter 2018 was 6.7%, unchanged sequentially. During the first quarter 2018, Citigroup repurchased 30 million common shares and returned a total of $3.1 billion to common shareholders in the form of common share repurchases and dividends.\nGlobal Consumer Banking 1Q'18 4Q'17 1Q'17 QoQ% YoY% ($ in millions, except as otherwise noted)\nNorth America 5,157 5,182 4,945 - 4% Latin America 1,347 1,359 1,167 (1)% 15% Asia (a) 1,929 1,908 1,734 1% 11% Total Revenues $ 8,433 $ 8,449 $ 7,846 - 7% North America 2,645 2,568 2,597 3% 2% Latin America 759 768 667 (1)% 14% Asia (a) 1,277 1,227 1,187 4% 8% Expenses $ 4,681 $ 4,563 $ 4,451 3% 5% Net Credit Losses 1,736 1,640 1,603 6% 8% Credit Reserve Build / (Release) (b) 143 175 183 (18)% (22)% Provision for Benefits and Claims 26 36 29 (28)% (10)% Total Cost of Credit $ 1,905 $ 1,851 $ 1,815 3% 5% Net Income $ 1,392 $ 580 $ 997 NM 40% Adjusted Net Income (c) $ 1,392 $ 1,330 $ 997 5% 40% Income from Continuing Operations North America 838 77 614 NM 36% Adjusted North America (c) 838 827 614 1% 36% Latin America 183 165 135 11% 36% Asia (a) 373 340 249 10% 50% Key Indicators ($B) Retail Banking Average Loans 147 145 139 1% 6% Retail Banking Average Deposits 309 307 303 1% 2% Investment AUMs 164 161 147 2% 11% Cards Average Loans 159 158 151 1% 6% Cards Purchase Sales 122 136 112 (11)% 8% Note: Please refer to the Appendices and Footnotes at the end of this press release for additional information.

In constant dollars, revenues increased 8%. On this basis, retail banking revenues grew 7%, with continued volume growth across loans and deposits, as well as improved deposit spreads.

Corporate Lending revenues of $521 million increased 19% (excluding gain / (loss) on loan hedges), reflecting loan growth as well as lower hedging costs.\nMarkets and Securities Services revenues of $5.0 billion increased 3%, as a decline in Fixed Income Markets revenues was more than offset by strong revenue growth in Equity Markets and Securities Services.
