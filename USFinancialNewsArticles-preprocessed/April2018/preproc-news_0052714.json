There are factors to consider on the hawkish side such as lending appetite by banks, which has picked up.”\nA key market gauge of long-term inflation expectations in the euro zone rose to its highest level in 8 weeks on Thursday, at 1.718 percent, showing that investors’ views on the inflation outlook have changed since the ECB’s last meeting.\nWith the bond-buying scheme due to expire in September, the ECB will have to decide in June or July whether to extend purchases or wind them down. And with the risk of a global trade war still looming, it may not decide until absolutely necessary, so retaining the flexibility to adjust policy.\nMoney-market pricing suggests that investors expect the ECB to deliver its first hike in this economic cycle by June 2019, having pushed back expectations from early next year. tmsnrt.rs/2HKfMx2\nEuro zone bond yields fell 1-3 basis points in midday trade as U.S. bond yields pulled back from multi-year highs.\nGermany’s benchmark 10-year bond yield fell 2.4 bps to 0.613 percent after reaching a six-week high of 0.655 percent on Tuesday. It was on track for its biggest fall in 3 weeks.\nEuro zone debt yields have been dragged up this week by a rise in U.S yields. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury jumped to a four-year peak of 3.035 percent on Wednesday, its highest since January 2014 US10YT-=RR.\nThe Treasury yield has climbed on expectations of steady U.S. economic expansion, accelerating inflation and concerns about increasing debt supply.\nElsewhere, Italian debt outperformed after the leader of Italy’s centre-left Democratic Party (PD) said the PD’s top brass would meet on May 3 to discuss whether to enter into talks with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement on potentially forming a coalition together.\nThe premium that investors demand to hold 10-year Italian bonds over top-rated Germany tightened to 112.6 basis points on the news, before widening slightly to 113 basis points, .\nReporting by Fanny Potkin and Dhara Ranasinghe; Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ",
