Soccer Football - Champions League Quarter Final Second Leg - AS Roma vs FC Barcelona - Stadio Olimpico, Rome, Italy - April 10, 2018 Barcelona's Luis Suarez and Gerard Pique look dejected after the match REUTERS/Tony Gentile \nBarca’s 3-0 defeat at the Olympic Stadium on Tuesday saw them eliminated from Europe’s elite club competition and has been described as one of the worst moments in the club’s history. \nTheir challenge now is to limit the fallout from that defeat and ensure it does not taint the rest of their season, which could still end with them winning a league and King’s Cup double and become the first team to go undefeated through an entire La Liga campaign. \nThe Catalans equalled Real Sociedad’s record run of 38 games unbeaten last week by beating Leganes 3-1 and will set a new landmark as long as they avoid defeat to Valencia. \nCoach Ernesto Valverde admitted his players might suffer a hangover from the Roma defeat. \n“We hope it doesn’t affect the rest of our season but it’s obviously a huge blow to our confidence,” he said. \n“Without a doubt it’s a painful defeat, we have ended up getting knocked out but we have to keep going.” \nValverde bore the brunt of criticism in the media. His decision not to make a substitution until the 81st minute has been questioned, while some reports said he had not given enough rest to key players. \nBarca’s setback could provide an opportunity for Valencia, who climbed above champions Real Madrid into third last weekend and are two wins away from sealing a return to next season’s Champions League. \nBarca, who meet Sevilla in the King’s Cup final on April 21, need 10 points from their seven remaining games to clinch their 25th league title. They lead nearest challengers Atletico Madrid by 11 points, with Valencia three points further back. Real Madrid trail Valencia by a point. \n“There’s no other remedy than to weather the storm and get through the next few days, which are bound to be tough, and focus on winning what’s left because we still haven’t won anything,” added Valverde. \n“It hurts a lot but we have to look forward.” \nAtletico Madrid host Levante on Sunday, while champions Real visit basement club Malaga.
