    "text": "Cultures of \"matahara,\" or \"maternity harassment,\" still present at Japanese workplaces, discourage women from having children, experts say, and may even influence when they become pregnant if they do. The issue came under recent focus after Japanese newspaper The Mainichi featured a man who said he and his wife broke an \"unspoken rule\" by becoming pregnant before their \"turn\" at her workplace.\nThe husband and his wife, a childcare worker in Japan's Aichi Prefecture, apologized for what her boss described as \"selfishly breaking the rules,\" the 28-year-old man told the newspaper in a letter. According to the letter, the director of the child care center set up \"shifts\" for when female employees could have children to avoid too many workers taking leave in a nation facing a scarcity of child care options.\nMore than 47,000 children remained wait-listed for certified day cares in Japan last year,",
