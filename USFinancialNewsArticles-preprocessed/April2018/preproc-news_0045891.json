    "text": "(Reuters) - The Russian government may feel compelled to support Oleg Deripaska after the billionaire and his businesses were hit by U.S. sanctions this month, because his sprawling empire employs tens of thousands of people across Russia.\nFILE PHOTO: President of En+ Group, Oleg Deripaska attends an agreement signing ceremony with the Krasnoyarsk region's government, in Moscow, Russia December 12, 2017. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin/File Photo Deripaska’s group Basic Element (Basel) owns or controls about 100 companies around the world that range from the world’s second biggest aluminum producer Rusal ( 0486.HK ) to a carmaker and power generation firms.\nBasel’s website says about 200,000 people are employed by these businesses. The majority are in Russia but it does not give a precise breakdown.\nTen cities across Russia depend on his companies for employment, according to government data from 2015.\nBelow is a more detailed list of companies owned by Basel and their employees:\n- Basel controls En+ Group ( ENPLq.L ), which employs about 35,000 people.\n- En+ holds a 48.13 percent stake in Rusal, the aluminum firm that employs 62,000 people, of which 52,390 are in Russia, a 2016 Rusal report said. It did not give 2017 figures.\n- En+ Group owns EuroSibEnergo, which draws together power generation and coal assets such as hydropower unit IrkutskEnergo ( IRGZ.MM ) and coal firm VostSibUgol. It employs 30,000 people.\n- Basel also owns Russian Machines, which employs 57,000 people in the range of companies it controls such as carmaker GAZ Group and other firms involved in making railway carriages, road construction and agriculture.\n- Basel Aero, which runs four airports in the southern cities of Sochi, Krasnodar, Anapa and Gelendzhik, employs about 6,000 people.\n- Basel controls a range of firms involved in building houses and producing construction materials, such as GlavMosStroi, GlavStroi Development, GlavStroi SPB and BaselCement. These firms employ more than 20,000 people.\n- AgroHolding Kuban, a Basel subsidiary involved in crop growing and livestock breeding, has about 5,000 workers.\nSources: Company websites and Russian government data. Some Rusal data came from cached pages no longer published on its website after the firm pared down information it made public.\nReporting by Anastasiya Lyrchikova and Gleb Stolyarov; Writing by Polina Ivanova; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ",
