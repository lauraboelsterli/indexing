    "text": "302 COMMENTS WASHINGTON—The Environmental Protection Agency plans to restrict research used in developing regulations, the agency said Tuesday, a change that could affect rules governing everything from household products to power-plant emissions.\nThe proposal follows years of complaints by conservatives that regulations such as emissions restrictions under the Obama administration sometimes went beyond what science could prove. The new proposal would exclude the many research studies that don’t make their raw data public and limit the use of findings that can’t be reproduced by others. The EPA said this would boost transparency.\nThe proposal is subject to a public-comment period of at least 30 days and is likely to see legal challenges, which could delay or prevent its implementation.\n“When you have studies that you actually publish from third parties, but you don’t publish the methodology, and you don’t publish the data, you only publish the conclusions, that presents problems to those that want to offer comment on the veracity, the authenticity, the ability to assess and evaluate the conclusions that have been drawn,” Administrator Scott Pruitt said before signing the proposed rule.\nThe move prompted an uproar from scientists who say it would exclude so much research that the resulting rules would endanger Americans’ health. Ahead of the announcement, a coalition of 985 scientists issued a statement decrying the plan.\nRelated\nNewark Water Tests Show High Lead Levels “This proposal would greatly weaken EPA’s ability to comprehensively consider the scientific evidence,” they said in a letter issued Monday. The group said the EPA has long been very transparent in explaining the scientific basis for decisions and that requiring public data would exclude essential studies that involve proprietary information or confidential personal data.\n“EPA can only adequately protect our air and water and keep us safe from harmful chemicals if it takes full advantage of the wealth of scientific research that is available to the agency,” the letter added.\nThe rule follows previous moves by Mr. Pruitt to limit the influence of the scientific community at the EPA. Last year, he blocked any scientists who receive EPA funding from participating in federal advisory committees.\nThe move comes as Mr. Pruitt has found himself increasingly embattled in recent weeks, amid accusations of misuse of government funds. That has led to speculation that President Donald Trump might dismiss him, even as the EPA chief has actively pursued actions that back Mr. Trump’s deregulatory agenda.\nMr. Pruitt’s supporters made clear that lessening regulation is also an impetus for this rule.\n“Administrator Pruitt’s decision to bring science into the sunlight spells the end of junk science, which has fueled overregulation by the EPA for years,” said Steve Milloy, a Trump EPA transition team member who was instrumental in designing the rule.\nMany businesses have backed the new rule. The Chamber of Commerce said it would ensure that the agency is using scientifically sound and unbiased research.\nMr. Pruitt’s rule is similar to legislation that has repeatedly failed to pass Congress. The administrator made his announcement flanked by two lawmakers who introduced that legislation: Sen. Mike Rounds (R., S.D.) and Rep. Lamar Smith (R., Texas).\nMr. Smith has argued that confidential data such as patient records could be redacted or given only to those who agree to keep it confidential.\nScientists have said this sort of process would still exclude many studies and make others costly to use in regulation. Gretchen Goldman, research director for the Center for Science and Democracy, has said studies are already rigorously reviewed by scientific journals and that those peer reviews rarely require raw data to assess the science.\nRichard Denison, lead scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, said the rule could exclude studies that track real-life situations that it would be unethical to reproduce. He gave as an example the monitoring of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.\n“The only way to reproduce that work would be to stage another such oil spill, clearly nonsensical,” he said in a statement.\nAs for providing all the raw data, Mr. Denison said that would prevent the use of medical records that must be kept confidential by law.\nThe American Association for the Advancement of Science—the world’s largest general scientific society and the publisher of the journal Science—said the rule would also exclude many studies that rely on outside funders, because they sometimes limit access to the underlying data.\n“This proposal appears to be an attempt to remove valid and relevant scientific evidence from the rule-making process,” Rush Holt, a former Democratic congressman who is now chief executive of the organization, said in a statement.\nWrite to Heidi Vogt at heidi.vogt@wsj.com",
