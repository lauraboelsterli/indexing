    "text": "(Adds strike extension)\nATHENS, April 18 (Reuters) - Greek ferries remained docked at the country’s ports on Wednesday as seamen, marine engineers and ship cooks walked off the job to protest against planned government reforms which they say will further hurt their labour rights.\nThe 24-hour strike was organised by Greece’s seamen federation (PNO), which said the leftist-led government was preparing a reform allowing non-European flagged transport ships to sail in Greece, leading to job losses for Greek crews.\nThe reform is coming on top of pension cuts, rising unregistered labour and work without any insurance, PNO said.\nPNO said later on Wednesday that the strike would be extended until Friday morning. “No more blows against our sector,” it said in a statement.\nPassenger traffic was slow at Piraeus port on Wednesday morning. Traffic has been picking up as the summer, the top tourism season for the Mediterranean country, approaches.\nMarine unions have strongly resisted reforms liberalising the shipping sector, which along with tourism is a pivotal industry for Greece, a country of proud seafarers and shipowners.\nSince its worst debt crisis in decades broke out in 2010, Greece has sold management rights and majority stakes at its two largest ports, as demanded by its foreign lenders, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.\nThe Greek state is considering concession deals for the development of about 850 small ports and marinas.
