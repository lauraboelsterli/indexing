    "text": "EPS up 27% and Loan Portfolio up 14.9%, Year-over-Year\nSAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BofI Holding, Inc. (NASDAQ: BOFI) (“BofI”), parent company of BofI Federal Bank (the “Bank”), today announced financial results for the third fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018. Net income was a record $51.3 million, an increase of 25.0% from $41.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Earnings attributable to BofI’s common stockholders were $51.2 million or $0.80 per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of 25.1% from $40.9 million or $0.63 per diluted share for the third quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Financial Summary:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Q3 Fiscal 2018 Q3 Fiscal 2017 % Change Net interest income $ 116,683 $ 88,559 31.8 % Non-interest income $ 23,525 $ 23,168 1.5 % Net income $ 51,253 $ 40,994 25.0 % Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 51,176 $ 40,917 25.1 % Diluted EPS $ 0.80 $ 0.63 27.0 % “Strong loan production across our multifamily, small balance commercial real estate, and C&I lending businesses and record quarterly fee income resulted in a 27% year-over-year increase in earnings per share and a 17% increase in book value per share,” explained Greg Garrabrants, President and CEO of BofI. “Despite ongoing investments across our organization, we maintained a strong efficiency ratio of 32.4% and a 22.8% return on average common stockholders’ equity this quarter.”\n“We continue to deploy excess capital with the acquisition of a specialty software and services business from Epiq in April. While we did not acquire any deposits in this transaction, the addition of proprietary software and the trustee and fiduciary services team provides incremental fee income and enhances our commercial deposit franchise going forward,” stated Mr. Garrabrants.\n“We completed another successful tax season with our long-term partner, H&R Block,” stated Andy Micheletti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of BofI. “This was the first tax season that the Bank was the exclusive originator of H&R Block-branded Refund Advance loans. Our exclusivity and growth in Refund Advance loans led to an increased net interest margin of 4.77% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to 4.24% last year. ”\n“Overall credit quality remains strong, as evidenced by two basis point of net charge-offs on average loans and only 39 basis points of non-performing assets to total assets at the end of this quarter,” stated Mr. Micheletti. “The increase in our loan loss provision this quarter was driven almost entirely by reserves for Refund Advance loans. The majority of Refund Advance loans have been repaid and credit losses are tracking in line with our expectations.”\nFor the nine months ended March 31, 2018, net income was a record $115.3 million, an increase of 12.8% over net income of $102.2 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017. Earnings attributable to BofI’s common stockholders were $115.1 million or $1.78 per diluted share for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of 13.4% from $102.0 million or $1.57 per diluted share for the nine months ended March 31, 2017. Earnings for the quarter and for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 were primarily related to increased net interest income from loan growth and revenues related to seasonal H&R Block-branded products.\nOther Highlights:\nTotal assets reached $9,982.3 million, up $1,282.3 million or 14.7% compared to March 31, 2017 Loan and lease portfolio grew by $1,044.0 million or 14.9% compared to March 31, 2017 Loan and lease originations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $2,491.3 million, up 94.0% compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2017 Deposits grew by $1,164.1 million, or 17.1% compared to March 31, 2017 Asset quality remains strong with total non-performing assets of 0.39% of total assets at March 31, 2018 Return on average common stockholders’ equity was 22.84% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 Efficiency ratio was 32.40% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 Tangible book value increased to $14.49 per share, up $2.05 per share compared to March 31, 2017\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Income Statement Summary\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2018, BofI earned $51.3 million or $0.80 per diluted share compared to $41.0 million, or $0.63 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Net interest income increased $28.1 million or 31.8% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to March 31, 2017, due to $1,438.5 million growth in average-earning assets, interest income from Refund Advance loans and higher interest rates.\nThe loan and lease loss provision was $16.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $4.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increase in the provision is primarily the result of additional provision for Refund Advance loans consistent with increased originations in the loan product and overall portfolio loan growth.\nFor the third quarter ended March 31, 2018, non-interest income was $23.5 million compared to $23.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The $0.4 million increase year over year was the result of a $1.7 million increase in mortgage banking income, $0.2 million increase in gain on sale – other income, a $0.1 million reduction of unrealized loss on securities, partially offset by a $0.8 million decrease in prepayment penalty fee income, a $0.4 million decrease in realized gain (loss) on securities and net decreased banking service fees and other income of $0.4 million.\nNon-interest expense or operating costs increased $10.0 million to $45.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from $35.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was mainly a result of an increase in salaries and related expense of $4.6 million as a result of staffing increases to support growth in lending and information technology infrastructure development. Other operating expense increases include an increase in advertising and promotional of $2.2 million and an increase of $1.5 million in other and general expense. The increases in the other operating costs are primarily to support loan and deposit growth, as well as data processing, software and marketing initiatives.\nBalance Sheet Summary\nBofI’s total assets increased $1,480.6 million, or 17.4%, to $9,982.3 million, as of March 31, 2018, up from $8,501.7 million at June 30, 2017. The increase in total assets was primarily due to an increase in cash of $847.5 million and loan portfolio growth of $690.2 million on a net basis, primarily from portfolio loan originations of $4,561.2 million less principal repayments and other adjustments of $3,871.0 million. Investment securities decreased $99.6 million primarily due to sales and principal repayments. Total liabilities increased by $1,393.2 million, or 18.2%, to $9,060.7 million at March 31, 2018, up from $7,667.4 million at June 30, 2017. The increase in total liabilities resulted primarily from growth in deposits of $1,064.3 million and an increase in FHLB borrowings of $328.0 million. Stockholders’ equity increased by $87.4 million, or 10.5%, to $921.7 million at March 31, 2018 from $834.2 million at June 30, 2017. The increase was primarily the result of $115.3 million in net income, $9.2 million of vesting and issuance of RSUs and stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by $35.2 million in stock repurchases and $0.2 million of dividends declared on preferred stock.\nThe Bank’s Tier 1 core capital to adjusted average assets ratio was 9.40% at March 31, 2018.\nConference Call\nA conference call and webcast will be held on Thursday, April 26, 2018 at 5:00 PM Eastern / 2:00 PM Pacific.
