REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo\nTwitter and Disney’s ESPN sports networks will announce details of coming live shows later on Monday and also on Wednesday when each presents their future programming lineups to advertisers, the companies said.\nThe move will expand Twitter’s streaming video offerings and help Disney reach more audiences online while traditional television viewing is on the decline.\nUnder the agreement, Disney’s ABC broadcast network, the Disney Channels, Freeform and the company’s movie studio also will produce live programming for Twitter, the statement said.\nTwitter shares jumped 4.6 percent to $30.27 after the deal was announced. Disney shares already were trading 1.4 percent higher following the record-setting debut of “Avengers: Infinity War.” Reporting by Lisa Richwine in Los Angeles; Editing by Lisa Shumaker",
