    "text": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., April 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Benchmark Electronics, Inc. (NYSE: BHE) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nThree Months Ended\nMar 31,\nDec 31,\nMar 31,\nIn millions, except EPS\n2018\n2017 (1)\n2017 (1)\nNet sales\n$608\n$666\n$558\nNet income (loss) (2)\n$(24)\n$(76)\n$9\nNet income – non-GAAP\n$20\n$25\n$16\nDiluted EPS (2)\n($0.49)\n($1.54)\n$0.17\nDiluted EPS – non-GAAP\n$0.41\n$0.49\n$0.32\nOperating margin\n3.0%\n3.3%\n2.0%\nOperating margin – non-GAAP\n3.7%\n4.1%\n3.6%\n(1)\nPrior period amounts have been adjusted to reflect the adoption of ASC 606 on a retrospective basis.\n(2)\nIncludes $40 million ($0.82 per share) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 of foreign withholding taxes and state tax expense of repatriation of foreign cash to US parent company and $98 million ($1.95 per share) for the three months ended December 31, 2017 of tax expense related to the effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. Tax Reform).\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted new accounting guidance, FASB ASC Topic 606 \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" (ASC 606), relating to revenue recognition. We adopted ASC 606 using the full retrospective transition method. Accordingly, we have adjusted prior period information to be consistent with ASC 606. The adoption of ASC 606 did not materially impact our overall financial position.\nA reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results is included below.\n\"Overall, performance in the first quarter was solid. Revenues were up 9% year-over-year and gross margins improved 40 bps to 9.5%. Non‐GAAP EPS of $0.41 exceeded the high end of our guidance by $0.03; cash cycle days ended at 68 days, within our 73 to 68 day target range; and we achieved 11.2% ROIC, a 90 bps quarter‐over‐quarter improvement,\" said Paul Tufano, Benchmark's President and CEO.\n\"We continue to see good progress in bookings and are encouraged by the quality of our new customer engagements. For the second quarter, the convergence of timing dynamics related to mix shifts primarily in medical, new customer ramp headwinds, and planned investments in engineering and solutions will impact our reported financials. Consequently, our guidance reflects these factors with sequential revenue in the range of $590 million to $630 million and non-GAAP EPS between $0.26 and $0.34,\" continued Tufano. \"We are confident in our ability to address these challenges and remain positive about the second half and our long-term model.\"\nCash Conversion Cycle\nMar 31,\nDec 31,\nMar 31,\n2018\n2017\n2017\n(as adjusted)\nAccounts receivable days\n59\n59\n62\nContract asset days\n22\n20\n24\nInventory days\n50\n40\n48\nAccounts payable days\n(60)\n(54)\n(61)\nCustomer deposits\n(3)\n(3)\n(4)\n68\n62\n69\nFirst Quarter 2018 Industry Sector Update\nRevenue by industry sector (in millions) was as follows.\nMar 31,\nDec 31,\nMar 31,\nHigher-Value Markets\n2018\n2017 (as adjusted)\n2017 (as adjusted)\nIndustrials\n$\n125\n20\n%\n$\n129\n19\n%\n$\n117\n21\n%\nA&D\n98\n16\n95\n15\n100\n18\nMedical\n97\n16\n100\n15\n85\n15\nTest & Instrumentation\n102\n17\n93\n14\n76\n14\n$\n422\n69\n%\n$\n417\n63\n%\n$\n378\n68\n%\nMar 31,\nDec 31,\nMar 31,\nTraditional Markets\n2018\n2017 (as adjusted)\n2017 (as adjusted)\nComputing\n$\n103\n17\n%\n$\n172\n26\n%\n$\n100\n18\n%\nTelecommunications\n83\n14\n77\n11\n80\n14\n$\n186\n31\n%\n$\n249\n37\n%\n$\n180\n32\n%\nTotal\n$\n608\n100\n%\n$\n666\n100\n%\n$\n558\n100\n%\nFirst quarter revenues from higher-value markets were in line with expectations, including strong demand in Test & Instrumentation from semi-capital equipment customers. Higher-value markets were up 12% year-over-year from Test & Instrumentation and Medical markets.\nTraditional market revenues in Computing and Telecommunications were down sequentially from seasonality in Computing demand and up 3% year-over-year.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Bookings Update\nNew program bookings of $171 million at the midpoint. 17 engineering awards supporting early engagement opportunities. 32 manufacturing wins across all market sectors.\nThe Company projects that new program bookings for the first quarter will result in annualized revenue of $141 to $201 million when fully launched in the next 12-24 months. The new program bookings align with Benchmark's strategic focus.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Outlook\nRevenue between $590 - $630 million. Diluted GAAP earnings per share between $0.21 - $0.29. Diluted non-GAAP earnings per share between $0.26 - $0.34 (excluding any additional impact related to U.S. Tax Reform, restructuring charges and amortization of intangibles).\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results Conference Call Details\nA conference call hosted by Benchmark management will be held today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Company's financial results and outlook.

The words \"expect,\" \"estimate,\" \"anticipate,\" \"predict\" and similar expressions, and the negatives thereof, often identify forward-looking statements, which are not limited to historical facts. Forward-looking statements include, among other things: guidance for 2018 results; statements, express or implied, concerning future operating results or margins, the ability to generate sales and income or cash flow; and Benchmark's business and growth strategies and expected growth and performance. Although Benchmark believes these statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, they involve risks and uncertainties relating to operations, markets and the business environment generally. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materializes, or underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those indicated. Readers are advised to consult further disclosures on these risks and uncertainties, particularly in Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\", of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and in its subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements included in this document are based upon information available to the Company as of the date of this document, and it assumes no obligation to update them.\nAll forward-looking statements included in this release are based upon information available to Benchmark as of the date hereof, and the Company assumes no obligation to update them.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis document includes certain financial measures that exclude items and therefore are not in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). A detailed reconciliation between GAAP results and results excluding special items (\"non-GAAP\") is included in the following tables attached to this document. Management discloses non‐GAAP information to provide investors with additional information to analyze the Company's performance and underlying trends. Management uses non‐GAAP measures that exclude certain items in order to better assess operating performance and help investors compare results with our previous guidance. This document also references \"ROIC\", which the Company defines as operating income for the last twelve months excluding restructuring charges and other costs, amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation, adjusted for taxes, divided by the quarterly average of invested capital. Average invested capital is defined as shareholders' equity plus long-term debt minus cash as of the last five quarterly balance sheets. The Company's non‐GAAP information is not necessarily comparable to the non‐GAAP information used by other companies. Non‐GAAP information should not be viewed as a substitute for, or superior to, net income or other data prepared in accordance with GAAP as a measure of the Company's profitability or liquidity. Readers should consider the types of events and transactions for which adjustments have been made.\nBenchmark Electronics, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial

taxes applicable to historical earnings prior to December 31, 2017 and for the applicable state tax impact of foreign cash distributions into the U.S. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, this includes the impact of a one-time mandatory tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings and the re-measurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities for the decrease in the U.S. federal tax rate from 35% to 21%.\n(3)\nPotentially diluted securities totaling 0.3 million and 0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, were
