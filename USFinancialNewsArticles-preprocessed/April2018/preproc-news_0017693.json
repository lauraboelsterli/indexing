But it may take more than that to light another fire under bank stocks.\nBetween the 2016 presidential election and the end of 2017, bank stocks rose 42% as the operating environment for lenders quickly brightened. An era of big fines and strained profit margins suddenly gave way to a lighter regulatory touch and a much lower tax rate. Driven by these developments and gradual increases in interest rates, the sector far outperformed the broader market.\nBy the first quarter of 2018, bank stocks traded at higher valuations than they had in years—and investors didn’t seem convinced they should grow much beyond that. The KBW Nasdaq Bank index, a key measure of bank stocks, is roughly flat since the start of the year. That is only marginally better than the S&P 500, which has fallen about 1%. Big banks such as Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. have underperformed.\nDespite the middling performance, there were bright spots for banks. Market turmoil in the first quarter, which hurt bank stocks, should actually lift trading revenue. And interest rates continued to rise as the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark rate for a sixth time.\nRising rates are typically good for banks because they turn a profit on the difference between what they pay on deposits and the rate they collect on loans. Although long-term rates didn’t rise as quickly as short-term ones, many bank loans to companies are pegged to the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. This rate rose sharply —hitting 2.7% this week, compared with 2.11% at the end of last year—which will help lending profit margins.\nCommercial loan growth also may help profits. This finally picked up toward the end of the quarter after an unexplained and steep slowdown following the 2016 presidential election. It remains below its fast pace from a few years ago, however.\nBanks have been able to pocket the benefit from higher rates because they largely haven’t felt pressure to pay more interest to depositors. Eventually that will change as banks come under pressure to keep deposits from moving elsewhere. For now, though, there isn’t much pressure to increase those rates, which could crimp margins.\nMost of this is priced into bank stocks, however. And low long-term rates could act as a drag on bank profitability. A flattening yield curve, a bond-market gauge of economic conditions, doesn’t bode well for future bank profitability. Even worse, it potentially signals economic growth isn’t going to ramp up much from here, which is what bank stocks really need to propel them higher.\nTreasury yields, by maturity\n3%\nNow\nYear ago\n2\nTwo years ago\n1\n0\n20\n30\n7\n3\n2\n5\n10\n1\nYEARS TO MATURITY\nTreasury yields, by maturity\n3%\nNow\nYear ago\n2\nTwo years ago\n1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n5\n7\n10\n20\n30\nYEARS TO MATURITY\nTreasury yields, by maturity\n3%\nNow\nYear ago\n2\nTwo years ago\n1\n0\n5\n7\n10\n20\n30\n2\n3\n1\nYEARS TO MATURITY\nTreasury yields, by maturity\n3%\nNow\nYear ago\n2\nTwo years ago\n1\n0\n1\n3\n5\n20\n30\n7\n2\n10\nYEARS TO MATURITY\nSource: Treasury Department\nWrite to Rachel Louise Ensign at rachel.ensign@wsj.com and Peter Rudegeair at Peter.Rudegeair@wsj.com",
