Dudley, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, attends a conference about trade and globalization at the central bank of Brazil headquarters in Sao Paulo, Brazil, March 1, 2018. REUTERS/Nacho Doce/File Photo \nThe Trump administration is pursuing potential tariffs, negotiations and other restrictions to try and cut a massive trade deficit with China. “A tariff war would be a terrible, terrible outcome,” Dudley said when asked at Lehman College. “I would not look at trade wars as something that we can win.” Reporting by Jonathan Spicer; editing by Diane Craft",
