    "text": "ROME, April 13 (Reuters) - President Sergio Mattarella said on Friday he would wait “a few days” to see how to resolve Italy’s political stalemate after a fresh round of consultations made no progress in efforts to build a coalition government.\n“I will wait a few days, and then I will evaluate how to proceed to break the deadlock,” he told reporters at the end of two days of fruitless talks aimed at overcoming last month’s inconclusive national election.\n“From the way the consultations have gone in the past few days, it has become evident that the political parties’ talks... made no progress,” Mattarella said.
