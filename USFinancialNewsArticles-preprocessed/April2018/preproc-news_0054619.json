These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We believe that these non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the Company’s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measure. We compensate for the limitations of our non-GAAP financial measures by relying upon GAAP results to gain a complete picture of our performance.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user’s overall understanding of our current financial performance and our prospects for the future. Specifically, we believe the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results and because they are consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Company. We use non-GAAP measures to evaluate the operating performance of our business, for comparison with our forecasts, and for benchmarking our performance externally against our competitors. Also, when evaluating potential acquisitions, we exclude the items described below from our consideration of the target’s performance and valuation. Since we find these measures to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing the results from management’s perspective in addition to seeing our GAAP results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when read in conjunction with the Company’s GAAP financials, provide useful information to investors by offering:\nthe ability to make more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s on-going operating results; the ability to better identify trends in the Company’s underlying business and perform related trend analysis; a better understanding of how management plans and measures the Company’s underlying business; and an easier way to compare the Company’s operating results against analyst financial models and operating results of our competitors that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures.\nThe following are explanations of each of the adjustments that we incorporate into our non-GAAP measures, as well as the reasons for excluding each of these individual items in our reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures:\nStock-based compensation expense consists of non-cash charges related to the fair value of restricted stock units awarded to employees. The Company believes that the exclusion of these non-cash charges provides for more accurate comparisons of our operating results to our peer companies due to the varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. In addition, the Company believes it is useful to investors to understand the specific impact of share-based compensation on its operating results.\nAmortization of intangibles assets consists of non-cash charges that can be impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions. The Company considers its operating results without these charges when evaluating its ongoing performance and forecasting its earnings trends, and therefore excludes such charges when presenting non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that the assessment of its operations excluding these costs is relevant to its assessment of internal operations and comparisons to the performance of its competitors.\nLitigation expenses consist of legal expenses relating to intellectual property disputes, commercial claims and other types of litigation. While litigation may arise in the ordinary course of our business, we nevertheless consider litigation to be an unusual and unplanned activity and therefore exclude this charge when presenting non-GAAP financial measures.\nImpairment of goodwill relates to a non-cash write-down when circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable and because impairments are inconsistent in amount and frequency, the Company excludes them for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures.\nForeign exchange gains and losses consist of translation gains and/or losses of non-US$ denominated current assets and current liabilities, as well as certain other balance sheet items which result from the appreciation or depreciation of non-US$ currencies against the US$. We do not use financial instruments to manage the impact on our operations from changes in foreign exchange rates, and because our operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, we therefore exclude foreign exchange gains and losses when presenting non-GAAP financial measures.\nImpairment of long-term investments relates to the other-than-temporary, non-operating write down of the Company's minority stake investments. We do not consider these investments, which were made before 2007, to be strategic and exclude the performance of these investments when evaluating our ongoing performance and forecasting our earnings trends, and therefore excluding losses (and gains) from the investments when presenting non-GAAP financial measures.\nSilicon Motion Technology Corporation Consolidated Statements of Income (in thousands, except percentages and per ADS data, unaudited) For the Three Months Ended Mar. 31, 2017\n($) Dec. 31, 2017\n($) Mar. 31, 2018\n($) Net Sales 127,292 136,165 130,344 Cost of sales 62,466 72,878 67,790 Gross profit 64,826 63,287 62,554 Operating expenses Research & development 24,338 27,946 25,832 Sales & marketing 5,758 7,364 6,965 General & administrative 4,220 5,046 4,163 Amortization of intangibles assets 526 956 741 Impairment loss of goodwill - 10,337 - Gain from disposal of noncurrent assets held for sale - (1,880 ) - Operating income 29,984 13,518 24,853 Non-operating income (expense) Interest income, net 759 1,135 1,213 Foreign exchange gain (loss), net (347 ) (447 ) 1,076 Impairment of long-term investments - (120 ) - Others, net (11 ) 70 58 Subtotal 401 638 2,347 Income before income tax 30,385 14,156 27,200 Income tax expense 6,874 4,338 4,139 Net income 23,511 9,818 23,061 Earnings per basic ADS $0.66 $0.27 $0.64 Earnings per diluted ADS $0.65 $0.27 $0.64 Margin Analysis: Gross margin 50.9 % 46.5 % 48.0 % Operating margin 23.6 % 9.9 % 19.1 % Net margin 18.5 % 7.2 % 17.7 % Additional Data: Weighted avg.
