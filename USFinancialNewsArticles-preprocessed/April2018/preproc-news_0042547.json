Reconciliations of Net Income to PNOI and Net Income Attributable to EastGroup Properties, Inc. Common Stockholders to FFO are presented in the attached schedule \"Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures.\"\nSALES\nDuring the first quarter, EastGroup sold 11 acres of land in Houston for $2.6 million. The sale generated a gain of $86,000 which was recognized in Other on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income; the gain was included in FFO.\nAlso during the first quarter, the Company sold two operating properties containing 214,000 square feet in Houston and Tampa for $14.9 million. EastGroup recognized gains on the sales of $10,222,000 which are included in Gain on sales of real estate investments; these gains from sales of depreciable real estate investments are excluded from FFO.\nDEVELOPMENT\nDuring the first quarter, EastGroup began construction of West Road 5, a 58,000 square foot, multi-tenant business distribution building in Houston. This is the last building in the Company's West Road Business Park; the other four buildings are currently 100% occupied.\nAlso in the first quarter, the Company initiated construction of Broadmoor 2 in Atlanta. The multi-tenant business distribution building will contain 111,000 square feet and is located adjacent to the Company's 100% leased Broadmoor 1 property, which was acquired by EastGroup in 2017.\nThe development projects started in the first quarter are detailed in the table below:\nDevelopment Properties Started in 2018\nLocation\nSize\nAnticipated\nConversion\nDate\nProjected\nTotal Costs\n(Square feet)\n(In thousands)\nWest Road 5\nHouston, TX\n58,000\n07/2019\n$\n4,700\nBroadmoor 2\nAtlanta, GA\n111,000\n10/2019\n7,400\nTotal Development Properties Started\n169,000\n$\n12,100\nAt March 31, 2018, EastGroup's development program consisted of 17 projects (1,988,000 square feet).

The $23 million property will contain 200,000 square feet and is the first building underway at Gateway Commerce Park, which is expected to include a total of five buildings containing 850,000 square feet upon future development.\nDIVIDENDS\nEastGroup paid cash dividends of $.64 per share in the first quarter of 2018. This was the Company's 153 rd consecutive quarterly cash distribution to shareholders. EastGroup has increased or maintained its dividend for 25 consecutive years. The Company has increased it 22 years within that period, including increases in each of the last six years. The Company's payout ratio of dividends to FFO was 55% for the quarter. The annualized dividend rate of $2.56 per share yielded 3.0% on the closing stock price of $85.04 on April 18, 2018.\nFINANCIAL STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY\nEastGroup continues to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet. Debt-to-total market capitalization was 27.8% at March 31, 2018. For the first quarter, the Company had interest and fixed charge coverage ratios of 5.68x and a debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for real estate (EBITDAre) ratio of 5.69x.\nDuring the first quarter, EastGroup issued and sold 179,501 shares of common stock under its continuous equity program at an average price of $82.68 per share, providing net proceeds to the Company of $14.6 million.\nIn February, the Company refinanced a $65 million unsecured term loan, resulting in a 55 basis point reduction in the loan's effectively fixed interest rate. The loan, which has a maturity date of April 1, 2023, now has an effectively fixed interest rate of 2.313%. The refinancing will provide a net annual savings to the Company of approximately $340,000.\nIn mid-April, EastGroup closed $60 million of senior unsecured private placement notes with an insurance company. The notes have a 10-year term and a fixed interest rate of 3.93% with semi-annual interest payments. The notes will not be and have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements.\nOUTLOOK FOR 2018\nEPS for 2018 is now estimated to be in the range of $2.33 to $2.43.

In previous years, this metric excluded straight-line rent adjustments only. See the Definitions section of this press release for additional information about the change in this operating metric.\nDEFINITIONS\nThe Company's chief decision makers use two primary measures of operating results in making decisions: (1) property net operating income (PNOI), defined as Income from real estate operations less Expenses from real estate operations (including market-based internal management fee expense) plus the Company's share of income and property operating expenses from its less-than-wholly-owned real estate investments, and (2) funds from operations attributable to common stockholders (FFO). EastGroup defines FFO consistent with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts' definition, as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable real estate property and impairment losses, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nPNOI and FFO are supplemental industry reporting measurements used to evaluate the performance of the Company's investments in real estate assets and its operating results. The Company believes that the exclusion of depreciation and amortization in the industry's calculations of PNOI and FFO provides supplemental indicators of the properties' performance since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions. PNOI and FFO as calculated by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled but differently calculated measures for other REITs. Investors should be aware that items excluded from or added back to FFO are significant components in understanding and assessing the Company's financial performance.\nEastGroup sometimes refers to PNOI from Same Properties as \"Same PNOI\" in this press release and the accompanying reconciliation. Same Properties is defined as operating properties owned during the entire current period and prior year reporting period. Development properties are excluded until held in the operating portfolio for both the current and prior year reporting periods.\nThe Company's chief decision makers also use Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (EBITDAre) in making decisions. EBITDAre is defined as Net Income, excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable real estate property, plus interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\nIn a press release dated January 17, 2018, the Company, along with a group of other leading industrial REITs (the Industrial REIT Group), announced that the Industrial REIT Group has agreed on a consistent methodology to calculate various non-GAAP property operating metrics. These non-GAAP metrics include common methodologies for determining property stabilization and occupancy as well as reporting of comparative changes in rental rates and tenant retention rates. In addition, the Industrial REIT Group has agreed on the definition of the annual pool of properties (same property pool) used in calculating same property net operating income growth (same property NOI). Specifically, the annual same property pool will only include properties held as of the beginning of the prior calendar year which were stabilized (according to the agreed upon definition) throughout both periods presented.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2018, all members of the Industrial REIT Group have agreed to calculate these non-GAAP metrics based on the agreed upon methodologies. These conforming changes do not have a material impact on EastGroup's non-GAAP metrics for periods prior to 2018. The actual results for 2018 and outlook for 2018 included in this earnings release are based on the revised methodologies.\nAs a result of the efforts of the Industrial REIT Group, EastGroup made the following conforming changes, effective January 1, 2018:\nThe Company transfers development properties to the operating portfolio at the earlier of 90% occupancy or one year after shell completion. EastGroup's previous policy was to transfer properties at the earlier of 80% occupancy or one year after shell completion. The calculation of the Company's rental rate change no longer excludes leases for space which has been vacant for more than 24 months. All leases are now included, with the exception of short-term leases with terms less than 12 months and leases of first generation space in properties acquired or developed by EastGroup. The calculation of same property NOI on the cash basis excludes straight-line rent adjustments and amortization of above/below market rent intangibles. In prior periods, EastGroup included the amortization of above/below market rent intangibles in its calculation of same property NOI on the cash basis.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nEastGroup will host a conference call and webcast to discuss the results of its first quarter and review the Company's current operations on Friday, April 20, 2018, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time.
