Schmidt began his role on April 16.\n\"In response to client interest in various digital products, we are exploring how best to serve them in the space,\" Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Tiffany Galvin-Cohen said in a statement.\n\"At this point, we have not reached a conclusion on the scope of our digital asset offering,\" she said.\nTearsheet , a finance industry news site, first reported the news earlier Monday.\nGoldman was one of a few major financial institutions to begin clearing CME and Cboe bitcoin futures for clients when the derivatives products launched in December.\nSchmidt was previously senior vice president at quantitative trading firm Seven Eight Capital, and a quant trader at a proprietary firm, among other roles, according to his LinkedIn profile. His profile page lists \"Crypto\" as his current role.\nWATCH: These college students are mining cryptocurrency from their dorm rooms show chapters These college students are mining cryptocurrency in their dorm rooms 9:30 AM ET Sun, 1 April 2018 | 03:15",
