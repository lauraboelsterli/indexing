Financial website How Much used data from real-estate site Zillow to collect average home prices for every state to find the minimum income needed to afford a place there and found that, in some places, the income necessary is almost or over six figures.\nHow Much used a mortgage calculator to calculate monthly payments, which consist of the principal and the interest for an assumed home loan. \"The interest rate we used varied from 4-to-5 percent in each state, depending on the market. The lower the interest rate, the lower the monthly payment. To keep things simple, we assumed buyers could contribute a 10 percent down payment.\"\nBased on that data, here are the top five states where you need to make almost or over $100,000 a year to afford the average home:\nHawaii Minimum annual income: $153,520\nAverage home value: $610,000\nCalifornia Minimum annual income: $120,120\nAverage home value: $499,900\nMassachusetts Minimum annual income: $101,320\nAverage home value: $419,900\nshow chapters Location alone won't determine if your home is a great investment, but this will      9:20 AM ET Tue, 21 March 2017 | 01:05 Colorado Minimum annual income: $100,200\nAverage home value: $415,000\nNew York Minimum annual income: $91,720\nAverage home value: $379,000\n\"Our map creates a quick snapshot of housing affordability across the United States,\" according to How Much. \"There are several pockets in which only the upper-middle class and above can afford to own even the average home, most notably across the West and in the Northeast.\"\nIn fact, \"there are only two states west of the Mississippi River where a worker with an annual salary under $40,000 can afford a midlevel home: Missouri and Oklahoma.\"\nThat doesn't mean housing is unaffordable in other places, though: \"The best takeaway is that housing remains affordable in large swaths of the country,\" even though there are certain high-profile states where it could be tougher to find one. \nIf you're thinking of buying a home, check out these tips to get started.\nLike this story?
