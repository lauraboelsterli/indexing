Silhouettes of mobile users are seen next to a screen projection of Facebook logo in this picture illustration taken March 28, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration \nThe social media company has come under fire after it was disclosed that political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, which worked for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, gained access to the personal data of up to 87 million Facebook users. \nFacial recognition techniques are used by Facebook to help users tag their friends in photos on the social media platform. \n\"The scanning of facial images without express, affirmative consent is unlawful and must be enjoined,\" Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) said. ( bit.ly/2GXGWQF ) \nPeople can choose whether or not to allow this technology and they can change their mind at any time. When someone has their setting turned off, we don’t use this technology to identify them in photos, Facebook Deputy Chief Privacy Officer Rob Sherman said. \nIn 2011, Facebook had settled privacy-related charges with the FTC, which were brought about by EPIC's complaints. ( bit.ly/1U44BfY ) \nEPIC and the consumer groups said on Friday that Facebook’s use of facial recognition tools also violates terms of the 2011 settlement.
