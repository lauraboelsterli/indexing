    "text": "Shares of Facebook , Twitter and Snap fell into bear market territory Monday as the S&P 500 , Nasdaq and a handful of major tech stocks flirted with correction .\nFacebook fell to more than 20 percent off its 52-week high, Twitter dropped to 24 percent off its 52-week high and Snap cratered nearly 40 percent off its 52-week high.\nFacebook is still reeling after a massive data leak by research firm Cambridge Analytica and questions about user privacy, while Snap is facing criticism over the recent redesign of its Snapchat app â€” one Wall Street firm said Monday that students called the redesign \"annoying.\"\nshow chapters Options traders are betting Facebook's problems are far from over 7:34 PM ET Thu, 29 March 2018 | 01:22 \"The market pullback and the post Facebook-Cambridge [Analytica] aftermath has been the 'one-two punch' of bad news that has scared the bulls,\" GBH Insights' Dan Ives told CNBC. \"With tech leaders such as Amazon under attack on a daily basis from Trump, and Facebook going through a white knuckle period, as well as the social media names post the Cambridge debacle, this has been a worrisome period for tech investors.\"\nPresident Donald Trump hit Amazon again Monday , echoing his earlier comments that the e-commerce giant is shirking tax obligations and hurting the postal system.\nAmazon , Google and Netflix all sank to roughly 16 percent off 52-week highs Monday. Microsoft and Apple were trading at roughly 9 percent off their 52-week highs midday.\n\"We believe this is more of a pullback rather than the start of a broader game changer direction for tech stocks,\" Ives said.\nThe coming weeks will be a \"hand-holding time for tech,\" he said.\nStill, the S&P tech sector is the top-performing sector year to date.\nDisclosure: CNBC parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Snap .\nWATCH: Trump goes after Amazon again show chapters Trump goes after Amazon again 4 Hours Ago | 01:06",
