    "text": "YORK, Pa., April 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- York Traditions Bank (OTC Pink: YRKB) reported net income of $1,094,000, or 39 cents per share, for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $605,000, or 27 cents per share, for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. This represents an 81% increase over the first quarter of 2017. Book value per common share increased to $16.62 at March 31, 2018.\n\"We are off to a solid start in 2018,\" stated Eugene J. Draganosky, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Loans have grown $39.3 million, or 13%, over the past year. In conjunction with advances in interest rates, this drove the first quarter increase in net interest income of $573,000 or 18%. Continued solid credit quality allowed us to reduce our first quarter provision for loan losses to $80,000. Traditions Mortgage turned in an outstanding quarter recognizing $1,028,000 from gains on the sale of mortgages, an increase of $149,000 or 17% over the first quarter last year. We also recognized the benefit of the recently enacted Tax Cut and Jobs Act. Our effective tax rate fell from 30.3% in the first quarter 2017 to 18.7% in the first quarter 2018. Despite pre-tax earnings increasing $478,000, or 55%, our federal income tax fell $11,000 or 4%.\"\nOn March 22, 2018, York Traditions Bank opened its first loan production office in Camp Hill, Pennsylvania. Later this summer, the Bank will open its sixth branch office, which will be its first located in York City.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (unaudited):\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nSelected Financial Data\nMar 31,\n2018\nDec 31,\n2017\nMar 31,\n2017\nInvestment securities\n$\n56,084\n$\n55,258\n$\n52,275\nLoans, net of unearned income\n353,633\n348,533\n314,290\nTotal assets\n447,953\n441,289\n400,780\nDeposits\n364,308\n363,089\n326,651\nBorrowings\n30,631\n26,224\n34,342\nSubordinated debt\n5,000\n5,000\n5,000\nShareholders' equity\n45,884\n45,319\n33,092\nBook value per common share\n$\n16.62\n$\n16.22\n$\n15.14\nAllowance/loans\n1.03%\n1.02%\n1.04%\nNon-performing assets/total assets\n0.64%\n0.64%\n0.61%\nTier 1 capital/average assets\n10.61%\n10.38%\n8.42%\nThree months ended Mar 31,\nSelected Operations Data\n2018\n2017\nInterest income\n$\n4,551\n$\n3,820\nInterest expense\n(825)\n(667)\nNet interest income\n3,726\n3,153\nProvision for loan losses\n(80)\n(153)\nInvestment securities gains (losses)\n(3)\n-\nGains on sale of mortgages\n1,028\n879\nOther income\n310\n300\nOther expense\n(3,635)\n(3,311)\nIncome before income taxes\n1,346\n868\nIncome taxes\n(252)\n(263)\nNet income\n$\n1,094\n$\n605\nEarnings per common share (basic)\n$\n0.39\n$\n0.28\nEarnings per common share (diluted)\n$\n0.39\n$\n0.27\nReturn on average assets\n1.01%\n0.62%\nReturn on average equity\n9.58%\n7.41%\nNet interest margin\n3.61%\n3.45%\nNet charge-offs(recoveries)/average loans\n0.00%\n0.01%\nSafe Harbor Statement:\nExcept for historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this release are forward-looking statements.
