    "text": "ELMER, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ELMER BANCORP, INC. (“Elmer Bancorp” or the “Company”) (OTC Pink: ELMA), the parent company of The First National Bank of Elmer (the “Bank”), announces its operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, Elmer Bancorp reported net income of $462,000, or $0.40 per common share, compared to $308,000, or $0.27 per common share for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $154,000, or 50.1%.\nContributing to the operating results for the comparative quarters was a 6.9%, or $171,000 increase in net interest income resulting from higher loan volumes. In addition, the first quarter of 2018 included a gain on the sale of an SBA loan. These positive factors were partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense of $147,000. These increased costs were primarily associated with expenses related to the Company’s growth. In addition, the loan loss provision increased $14,700 over the first quarter of 2017 to support loan volume.\nElmer Bancorp’s total assets at March 31, 2018 totaled $265.9 million, an increase of $6.6 million from the March 31, 2017 level of $259.3 million. Total loans increased 5.8%, or $13.0 million, to $236.9 million at March 31, 2018 from $223.9 million at March 31, 2017. Total deposits were $239.9 million at March 31, 2018, an increase of 2.7% or $6.4 million. Stockholders’ equity totaled $23.8 million at March 31, 2018. The Company and the Bank met all regulatory capital requirements at March 31, 2018.\nAs previously reported, on March 20, 2018 the Company’s Board of Directors declared a semi-annual cash dividend in the amount of $0.30 per common share payable on May 1, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 16, 2018.\nBrian W. Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated “The first quarter of 2018 produced some very solid financial metrics as we continue to channel significant assets into infrastructure and growth. This increase in first quarter earnings is also the result of our ability to further develop new markets and to refine existing income streams. The Tax Reform Act of 2017 will also assist the Bank in building capital as we reinvest back into our future. As we celebrate 115 years of community banking, we thank our customers for their continued loyalty and support.”\nThe First National Bank of Elmer, a nationally chartered bank headquartered in Elmer, New Jersey, has a long history of serving the community since its beginnings in 1903.
