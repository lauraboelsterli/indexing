Two rallies last week ran out of steam just above $71.\nThere was also pressure coming from the physical market, where top exporter Saudi Arabia is expected to cut prices for all the crude grades it sells to Asia in May, while output from Russia, the world's largest producer, hit an 11-month high.\nSaudi Arabia and Russia have led ongoing efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other major producers outside of OPEC to cut back output to support prices.\nThe market was also awaiting fuel inventory data due from the American Petroleum Institute later on Tuesday.\nCrude oil inventories are forecast to rise for a second week, gaining 1.7 million barrels in the week to March 30, according to a Reuters poll on Monday.
