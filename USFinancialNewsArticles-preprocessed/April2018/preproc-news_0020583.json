    "text": "LITTLE ROCK, Ark.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bank of the Ozarks (the “Bank”) (NASDAQ: OZRK) today announced that net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $113.1 million, a 26.9% increase from $89.2 million for the first quarter of 2017. Diluted earnings per common share for the first quarter of 2018 were $0.88, a 20.5% increase from $0.73 for the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Bank’s annualized returns on average assets, average common stockholders’ equity and average tangible common stockholders’ equity for the first quarter of 2018 were 2.16%, 13.17% and 16.53%, respectively, compared to 1.93%, 12.80% and 17.17%, respectively, for the first quarter of 2017. The calculation of the Bank’s return on average tangible common stockholders’ equity and the reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) are included in the schedules accompanying this release.\nGeorge Gleason, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We are very pleased to report our results for the first quarter of 2018, including record net interest income, an annualized return on average assets of 2.16%, $941 million growth in the funded balance of non-purchased loans, a 4.69% net interest margin and excellent asset quality metrics.”\nKEY BALANCE SHEET METRICS\nTotal loans, including purchased loans, were $16.61 billion at March 31, 2018, a 12.2% increase from $14.80 billion at March 31, 2017. Non-purchased loans, which exclude loans acquired in previous acquisitions, were $13.67 billion at March 31, 2018, a 33.8% increase from $10.22 billion at March 31, 2017. Purchased loans, which consist of loans acquired in previous acquisitions, were $2.93 billion at March 31, 2018, a 35.9% decrease from $4.58 billion at March 31, 2017. The unfunded balance of closed loans totaled $12.55 billion at March 31, 2018, an 11.5% increase from $11.26 billion at March 31, 2017, but a 4.9% decrease from $13.19 billion at December 31, 2017.\nDeposits were $17.83 billion at March 31, 2018, a 13.5% increase from $15.71 billion at March 31, 2017. Total assets were $22.04 billion at March 31, 2018, a 15.1% increase from $19.15 billion at March 31, 2017.\nCommon stockholders’ equity was $3.53 billion at March 31, 2018, a 22.7% increase from $2.87 billion at March 31, 2017. Tangible common stockholders’ equity was $2.82 billion at March 31, 2018, a 30.9% increase from $2.15 billion at March 31, 2017. Book value per common share was $27.42 at March 31, 2018, a 16.0% increase from $23.63 at March 31, 2017. Tangible book value per common share was $21.93 at March 31, 2018, a 23.8% increase from $17.72 at March 31, 2017. The calculations of the Bank’s tangible common stockholders’ equity and tangible book value per common share and the reconciliations to GAAP are included in the schedules accompanying this release.\nThe Bank’s ratio of total common stockholders’ equity to total assets was 16.00% at March 31, 2018 compared to 15.00% at March 31, 2017. Its ratio of total tangible common stockholders’ equity to total tangible assets was 13.22% at March 31, 2018 compared to 11.69% at March 31, 2017. The calculation of the Bank’s ratio of total tangible common stockholders’ equity to total tangible assets and the reconciliation to GAAP are included in the schedules accompanying this release.\nNET INTEREST INCOME\nNet interest income for the first quarter of 2018 was a record $217.8 million, a 14.2% increase from $190.8 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net interest margin, on a fully taxable equivalent (“FTE”) basis, was 4.69% for the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of 19 basis points from 4.88% for the first quarter of 2017. Average earning assets were $18.92 billion for the first quarter of 2018, a 17.2% increase from $16.14 billion for the first quarter of 2017.\nNON-INTEREST INCOME\nNon-interest income for the first quarter of 2018 decreased 1.2% to $28.7 million compared to $29.1 million for the first quarter of 2017. The Bank’s non-interest income for the first quarter of 2018 included $2.73 million of tax-exempt bank owned life insurance (“BOLI”) death benefits, which increased the Bank’s diluted earnings per common share by $0.02. There were no such benefits in the first quarter of 2017. The Bank’s service charges on deposit accounts declined from $11.3 million for the first quarter of 2017 to $9.5 million for the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to the Durbin Amendment’s impact on the Bank’s interchange revenue effective as of July 1, 2017. The Bank’s mortgage lending income declined from $1.6 million for the first quarter of 2017 to $0.5 million for the first quarter of 2018. This was a result of the Bank’s decision in December 2017 to exit the secondary market mortgage lending business and the substantial wind down of that business in the quarter just ended. The Bank expects only a nominal amount of mortgage lending income in the second quarter of 2018 and none thereafter.\nNON-INTEREST EXPENSE\nNon-interest expense for the first quarter of 2018 increased 19.9% to $93.8 million compared to $78.3 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Bank’s efficiency ratio (non-interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income FTE and non-interest income) for the first quarter of 2018 was 37.9% compared to 35.0% for the first quarter of 2017.\nASSET QUALITY, CHARGE-OFFS AND ALLOWANCE\nExcluding purchased loans, the Bank’s ratio of nonperforming loans as a percent of total loans was 0.09% at March 31, 2018 compared to 0.11% at March 31, 2017.\nExcluding purchased loans, the Bank’s ratio of nonperforming assets as a percent of total assets was 0.16% at March 31, 2018 compared to 0.25% at March 31, 2017.\nExcluding purchased loans, the Bank’s ratio of loans past due 30 days or more, including past due non-accrual loans, to total loans was 0.14% at March 31, 2018 compared to 0.16% at March 31, 2017.\nThe Bank’s annualized net charge-off ratio for non-purchased loans was 0.04% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 0.05% for the first quarter of 2017. The Bank’s annualized net charge-off ratio for purchased loans was 0.05% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 0.16% for the first quarter of 2017. The Bank’s annualized net charge-off ratio for all loans was 0.04% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 0.09% for the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Bank’s allowance for loan losses for its non-purchased loans was $96.5 million, or 0.71% of total non-purchased loans, at March 31, 2018 compared to $76.6 million, or 0.75% of total non-purchased loans, at March 31, 2017 and $92.5 million, or 0.73% of total non-purchased loans, at December 31, 2017. The Bank had $1.6 million of allowance for loan losses for its purchased loans at March 31, 2018 and 2017 and at December 31, 2017.\nMANAGEMENT’S COMMENTS, CONFERENCE CALL, TRANSCRIPT AND FILINGS\nIn connection with this release, the Bank released management’s comments on the results for the quarter just ended. Management will conduct a conference call to take questions on these quarterly results and management’s comments on the first quarter at 10:00 a.m. CT (11:00 a.m. ET) on Thursday, April 12, 2018. Interested parties may listen to this call by dialing 1-844-818-5110 (U.S. and Canada) or 210-229-8841 (internationally) and asking for the Bank of the Ozarks conference call. A recorded playback of the call will be available for one week following the call at 1-855-859-2056 (U.S. and Canada) or 404-537-3406 (internationally). The passcode for this playback is 9078203. The call will be available live or in a recorded version on the Bank’s Investor Relations website at ir.bankozarks.com under “Company News.” The Bank will also provide a transcript of the conference call on its Investor Relations website.\nThe Bank files annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy materials, and other information required by the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), copies of which are available electronically at the FDIC’s website at https://efr.fdic.gov/fcxweb/efr/index.html and are also available on the Bank’s Investor Relations website at http://ir.bankozarks.com .\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThis release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The Bank uses these non-GAAP financial measures, specifically return on average tangible common stockholders’ equity, tangible book value per common share, total tangible common stockholders’ equity and the ratio of total tangible common stockholders’ equity to total tangible assets, as important measures of the strength of its capital and its ability to generate earnings on its tangible capital invested by its shareholders. These measures typically adjust GAAP financial measures to exclude intangible assets. Management believes presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information which contributes to a proper understanding of the financial results and capital levels of the Bank. These non-GAAP disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other banks. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the tables at the end of this release under the caption “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis release and other communications by the Bank include certain “forward-looking statements” regarding the Bank’s plans, expectations, thoughts, beliefs, estimates, goals and outlook for the future that are intended to be covered by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s expectations as well as certain assumptions and estimates made by, and information available to, management at the time. Those statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and are subject to certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, such forward-looking statements.

Risk Factors” in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. Should one or more of the foregoing risks materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results or outcomes may vary materially from those projected in, or implied by, such forward-looking statements. The Bank disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements based on the occurrence of future events, the receipt of new information or otherwise.\nGENERAL INFORMATION\nBank of the Ozarks (NASDAQ: OZRK) is a regional bank providing innovative financial solutions delivered by expert bankers with a relentless pursuit of excellence.
