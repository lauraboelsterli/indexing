    "text": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Apple CEO Tim Cook have exchanged words over privacy during the last few weeks â€” in a battle that could be set to continue.\nIt started when Cook was asked what he would do if he were faced with the problems facing Facebook after the Cambridge Analytica scandal . \n\"I wouldn't be in this situation,\" Cook said in an interview with Recode's Kara Swisher and MSNBC's Chris Hayes last month. The Apple CEO questioned the practise of monetizing user data on social media platforms.\nZuckerberg then hit back days later , saying that the service should be free.\n\"You know, I find that argument, that if you're not paying that somehow we can't care about you, to be extremely glib. And not at all aligned with the truth,\" Zuckerberg said in an \"Ezra Klein Show\" podcast published Monday by Vox.\nThere hasn't been much else said since then, but Zuckerberg was ready to take on Apple if lawmakers asked him about it during his testimony on Tuesday in front of the Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees.\nshow chapters Zuckerberg avoids regulatory promises in congressional hearing      10 Hours Ago | 03:12 That is according to his notes , which were photographed by Associated Press photojournalist Andy Harnik and posted online by a CBS editor, Stefan Becket.\nOne section of the notes was entitled \"Tim Cook on big model.\"\nThe first bullet point referenced a quote from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos about working hard to charge users less money. The second point urged Zuckerberg to make the point that Facebook is free.\nBut then the notes prepared the Facebook CEO to attack Apple's track record with apps.\n\"Lots of stories about apps misusing Apple data, never seen Apple notify people,\" the notes said without elaborating.\nApple was not eventually mentioned in the testimony. \nAn Apple spokesperson was not immediately available for comment. \nBelow is a full copy of the notes.\nTWEET",
