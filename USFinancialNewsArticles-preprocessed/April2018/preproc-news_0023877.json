He will be based in Nashville, Tennessee, the capital of the U.S. healthcare industry. Mendez will work closely with Dr. Alejandro Badia, Co-Founder and visionary of OrthoNOW, who will focus his efforts on the role of Chief Medical Officer.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180410006361/en/\nOrthoNOW is poised to grow globally, and a dedicated and talented team behind the brand, I look forward to working with everyone to continue its momentum and accelerate growth - Nick Mendez, OrthoNOW CEO (Photo: Business Wire)\n“Today’s announcement marks another step towards aligning our organizational structure to OrthoNOW’s long-term strategy and speaks to our vision of putting the patient first -- helping them eliminate the many hurdles they have to get care,” said Badia. “We are excited to have Nick join us. His track record of building organizations, and leading and creating value for large healthcare and medical device companies makes him not only an ideal fit with our organization, but the right leader to grow the brand.”\nThe new organization structure further solidifies the company as a pioneer and a disruptor of the traditional healthcare model. “As Americans grapple with the state of the healthcare system and spiraling costs, the OrthoNOW model allows patients to see the right clinician at the right time,” said Co-Founder and CFO Justin Irizarry. “This ‘Orthopedics on Demand’ approach eliminates redundancy in the system, therefore maximizing the clinical outcome while minimizing cost and changing the true value of healthcare.”\n“This is both an exciting and important time to join OrthoNOW,” said Mendez. “With the company poised to grow globally, and a dedicated and talented team behind the brand, I look forward to working with everyone to continue its momentum and accelerate growth. I have spent my career with the elevating purpose of making a difference in the lives of the people we serve — physicians, clinicians and ultimately, the patient. OrthoNOW does just that.”\nAn experienced leader in the healthcare and medical device sectors, Mendez has an extensive track record building intrinsic value through opportunity, purpose and leadership on a global level. He has served as President and CEO of Enovate Medical, a manufacturer of IT equipment for the healthcare industry based in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. He also served in leadership roles for Gambro AB, now part of Baxter, including President of both Gambro Americas and Gambro Global Acute Business, and led the efforts as Vice President–OM Specialties of Owens & Minor, a Richmond, Virginia-based healthcare logistics company.\nOrthoNOW has grown into a national go-to resource for orthopedic issues and is poised to have a major footprint in orthopedic care across the nation. Strong interest in the brand is being fueled by the model’s innovative transformation of healthcare delivery that is prime for retailization.\nFor more information, or to schedule an interview with Mendez, contact Michelle Alban at michelle@latin2latin.com or by calling 954.376.4800.\nABOUT OrthoNOW:\nOrthoNOW® , the nation’s only orthopedic care franchise, is focused on the assessment and treatment of a range of orthopedic and sports injuries, chronic conditions and preventative protocols — all on a walk-in basis. Specialties include anything related to the foot, ankle, knee, hip, wrist, hand, elbow, shoulder and spine. Every OrthoNOW is equipped with digital imaging equipment and offers the latest techniques and treatments by a team of orthopedic clinicians and orthopedic specialized ancillary providers, including Electro Neuro Muscular Therapy (ENMT), which dramatically alleviates acute and chronic pain, and expedites recovery time from surgery. OrthoNOW’s mobile app features a revolutionary feature called On My Way NOW®, which allows patients to notify an OrthoNOW center that they are en route, the reason they’re coming and what time they expect to arrive. The recently upgraded app for iPhone users includes integration with Uber. OrthoNOW’s flagship center is in Doral, FL, with franchised centers in Florida and Georgia. Centers are coming soon to Michigan, Ohio and beyond.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180410006361/en/\nFor OrthoNOW\nMichelle Alban, 954-376-4800\nmichelle@latin2latin.com\nSource: OrthoNOW",
