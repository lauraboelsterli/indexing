    "text": "4 COMMENTS NIAMEY, Niger—The U.S. is reducing the presence of American commandos on Africa’s front lines, a move U.S. officers believe will make troops less vulnerable to the type of militant attack that left four U.S. soldiers dead in this West African country last fall.\nAmerican Green Berets, Navy SEALs and Marine special operators serving as advisers to African forces will largely stay closer to the rear, working from command centers and battalion headquarters, rather than accompanying African troops on hazardous operations against militant groups.\n“It should reduce our risk,” Maj. Gen. Mark Hicks, commander of U.S. special-operations troops in Africa, told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. “But,“ he added, ”life here is not without risk.”\nU.S. commandos work alongside members of the Cameroonian rapid-intervention battalion during a training exercise in the port of Douala, Cameroon, in 2015.

Hicks said his intention is to put U.S. special-operations troops to work at a higher level, helping African commanders tackle logistics, intelligence, artillery support, medevac and other aspects of large-scale operations against Boko Haram, al-Shabaab and other local Islamic State and al Qaeda affiliates.\n“We’re looking to advise as far up the chain [of command] as our assistance is desired and feasible,” Gen. Hicks said. “It’s not just about reducing risk—it’s about increasing our return on investment.”\nGen. Hicks said the shift began well before the Oct. 4 ambush of a joint U.S.-Nigerien patrol by militants allegedly aligned with an Islamic State branch, ISIS in the Greater Sahara. The attack killed two Green Berets, two U.S. soldiers assigned to assist special-operations forces and five Nigerien soldiers.\nIn the coming weeks, the military is expected to release its internal investigation into the ambush. Commanders have promised to release it first to the families of the soldiers killed.\nU.S. soldiers from the 3rd Infantry Regiment in October 2017 carry the flag-draped casket of Staff Sgt. Dustin M. Wright, who was killed in action in Niger. Photo: Lane Hiser/Planet Pix/ZUMA PRESS The ambush has focused congressional and public attention on the shadowy role of U.S. commandos in Africa. About 1,200 special-operations forces are regularly deployed to a dozen countries from Niger to Somalia, where armed groups often take advantage of vast expanses of poorly governed land, porous borders and populations alienated from their own capitals.\nIn March, militants from Jama’a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin—a collection of former al Qaeda groups—stormed army headquarters and the French Embassy in Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso.\n“My sense is that we’re still on the defensive across the Sahel,” Gen. Hicks said, referring to the band stretching east-west just south of the Sahara.\nNigerien forces exchange fire almost daily with Boko Haram militants around Lake Chad to the east, or with militants crossing from Mali in the west, said Col.-Maj. Moussa Salaou Barmou, commander of Niger’s special operations. Since the October ambush, American special-operations forces in Niger have pulled back, offering advice from inside relatively secure bases .\n“They’re no longer accompanying our elements on the ground,” Col.-Maj. Barmou said.\nPresident Donald Trump has generally delegated more decision-making authority to lower levels across the military, including in U.S. Central Command, which oversees the Middle East, and in U.S. Africa Command. The Obama administration was long criticized within the military for hoarding too much authority at higher levels, even at the White House, which some military officers believed undermined operations. Mr. Trump sought to change that dynamic, and when he first arrived in office allowed Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to make changes that freed troops up to make more battlefield decisions on their own.\nGen. Hicks spoke on the sidelines of annual special-operations exercises bringing commandos from the U.S. and its Western allies together with their counterparts from Chad, Niger, Mali, Nigeria and four other African countries.\nThis year, the training is focused less on moving-and-shooting basics and more on giving senior African officers experience running a large operation. Gen. Hicks described the U.S. efforts as a way to harness African and European allies to help combat militants who aspire to expand their reach from Africa to the West.\nSen. James Inhofe (R., Okla.) wrote the Army secretary on Monday, asking that the military send to Africa a new brigade specialized in training local forces.\n—Gordon Lubold in Washington \ncontributed to this article.\nWrite to Michael M.
