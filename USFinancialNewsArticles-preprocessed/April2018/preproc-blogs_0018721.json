Here’s what it means for the markets \nGlobal financial markets, which have been rocky in recent weeks as the U.S. and China threatened tariffs on each other’s goods, were cheered by Xi’s remarks, seeing them as a sign both governments would negotiate their way out of the dispute. President Donald Trump liked them, too, thanking Xi on Twitter and saying, “We will make great progress together.” \n— An expanded version of this report can be found at WSJ.com \nPopular on WSJ.com: ",
