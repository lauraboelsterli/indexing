    "text": "Dr. Pepper Snapple Group : \"It is so hard to understand this merger because they're going to give you a dividend. No one wants a dividend. You're going to have to wait until this deal now closes. That's my best bet. And then I'm going to be probably pushing it pretty hard, but the deal's got to close, the dividend's got to go and then it'll be OK.\"\nBGC Partners, Inc. : \"It's a lot of brokers, a lot of real estate, but I've got to tell you: we're in a market where Goldman Sachs just got slammed on reporting a pretty good number, so I'm not going to go down the food chain with BGC Partners.\"\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. Class B : \"Buy, buy, buy, buy, buy!\"\nEcolab Inc. : \"A plain, boring, terrific situation that I want you to hold onto and buy more if it comes down. What a fantastic security.\"\nPTC Inc. : \"Fifty-two week high today. Underpinnings are strong. Not my cup of tea, but I understand. It's in the sweet spot of technology.\"\nArista Networks : \"No one ever got hurt taking a little bit of profit, but I've got to tell you, [CEO] Jayshree Ullal is one of the great CEOs of our time and she is always welcome on the show.\"\nSterling Construction Company : \"Very small municipal building company. I'm going to stick with US Concrete in that area. I think US Concrete has been overdone on the downside.\"\nB&G Foods, Inc. : \"No. We're going to stay away. This whole food business is just- I like Conagra , but that's really about it. This group is just snakebit.\"\nMasco Corporation : \"I like Masco. I know there's a housing shortage so people are redoing their houses. You need Masco to be able to do it either way.\"\nWatch the full lightning round here: show chapters Cramer's lightning round: Don't buy Dr. Pepper until after its merger 20 Hours Ago | 05:07 ",
