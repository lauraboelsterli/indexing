    "text": "9 COMMENTS From a Dec. 12, 1943, letter from George Bush to his fiancée, Barbara Pierce :\nAs the days go by the time of our departure grows nearer. For a long time I had anxiously looked forward to the day when we would go aboard and set to sea. It seemed that obtaining that goal would be all I could desire for some time, but, Bar, you have changed all that. . . . Even now, with a good while between us and the sea, I am thinking of getting back. This may sound melodramatic, but if it does it is only my inadequacy to say what I mean. Bar, you have made my life full of everything I could ever dream of—my complete happiness would be a token of my love for you. . . . Goodnite, my beautiful. Everytime I say beautiful you about kill me but you’ll have to accept it—",
