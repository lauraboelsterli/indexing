    "text": "(Reuters) - Slovenian Janja Garnbret and Japan’s Tomoa Narasaki won the second round of IFSC Bouldering World Cup in Moscow, with the two countries sweeping all six medals in the finals on Sunday.\nWorld number two Garnbret and Miho Nonaka recorded the exact same score in the women’s final but Garnbret was declared winner after counting back to the semi-final results.\nNonaka was joined by fellow Japanese Akiyo Noguchi on the podium, who repeated her stellar performance from last week’s final in Meiringen, Switzerland for a second consecutive third-place finish.\nLast year’s combined world champion Narasaki was impressive again for his gold medal, while Slovenia’s Jernej Kruder took second spot ahead of compatriot Gregor Vezonik.\nIn the speed climbing competition, Iran’s Reza Alipour won the men’s final in 5.82 seconds, ahead of Russian Vladislav Deulin.\nAnouck Jaubert tied the world record with a time of 7.32 seconds in the women’s event to clinch the gold medal, while Iuliia Kaplina of Russia finished second.\nReporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Christian Radnedge\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
