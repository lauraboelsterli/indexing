    "text": "April 25, 2018 / 6:17 PM / Updated 20 minutes ago NYSE glitch forces Amazon and Alphabet traders elsewhere John McCrank , Chuck Mikolajczak 2 Min Read\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange said on Wednesday that trading was suspended on its exchange in five stocks, including Amazon and Alphabet, for the rest of the day due to a technical glitch involving trade reporting. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., April 19, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\nThe exchange, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc, said the suspension was due to a “price scale code” issue and any open orders in those securities would be cancelled.\nThe securities can still be traded on other exchanges, including those run by Nasdaq Inc, where the affected stocks are listed, Cboe Global Markets and IEX Group.\nAside from Amazon.com and both Alphabet share classes, affected symbols included Booking Holdings and Zion Oil and Gas Equity Warrants.\nA spokeswoman for the NYSE, Kristen Kaus, said the issue affected a small subset of clients whose trading reports in the affected symbols were being returned in an unexpected format, so the exchange suspended trading in the five securities to minimize customer impact.\nThere are 13 U.S. stock exchanges, around 40 private trading venues known as dark pools and dozens of single-dealer platforms. The NYSE trading suspension highlights the complexity of the fragmented market, but also its resiliency, given that stocks can trade elsewhere when one exchange has a problem.\nThe NYSE is one of last U.S. exchanges to have a physical trading floor, and prior to April 9, only securities that were listed on the exchange could be traded there. But following a recent technology upgrade, the NYSE said it would begin trading securities listed on other exchanges as well.\nThe trading suspension was not likely related to the technology upgrade, Kaus said.\nIn March, the NYSE and two of its affiliate exchanges were fined $14 million by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, partly in response to a nearly four-hour trading halt in July 2015 that was the result of a flawed software roll out.
