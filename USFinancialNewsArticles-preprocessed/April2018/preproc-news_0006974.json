China’s enactment of penalties on U.S. meat, fruit and other types of commodities is hitting one of America’s most successful export industries, the WSJ’s Joshua Zumbrun, Jacob Bunge and Jesse Newman report, raising uncertainty and deeper concerns that the levies could escalate and hit more goods . One Minnesota hog farmer says her markets are already volatile “without all the political things mixed in there.” The actions so far are relatively small, targeting a fraction of agriculture exports that reached $140.5 billion last fiscal year. China was the largest single export destination, receiving about $22 billion in U.S. goods. Any shift could hit companies in distribution channels handling China-bound goods. The U.S. Agriculture Transportation Coalition, which represents farm producers on shipping issues, suggests exporters could even invoke force majeure provisions to excuse them from obligations in ocean shipping contracts.\nRoadrunner Transportation Systems Inc. is trying to get its financial reporting and its trucking operations running on the right track. The company, built up through serial acquisitions in recent years, says it expects to be up to date on its financial reporting by the end of this quarter, WSJ Logistics Report’s Jennifer Smith writes, a potential milestone that comes as Roadrunner is still overhauling operations under a new management team . Roadrunner’s new report on the first three quarters of 2017 suggest it’s finding financial footing, with the company’s operating loss narrowing substantially to $14.1 million from $352.5 million the year before. A strong freight market this year should improve earnings still more, but the bigger focus over the long term will be making better operating sense of the businesses operating under Roadrunner’s corporate umbrella. The company has consolidated its logistics companies and is taking other steps to get its trucking units in gear.\nOverstock.com Inc. may have oversold its potential growth. The reselling retail specialist pulled its secondary stock offering, citing market conditions, the WSJ’s Paul Vigna reports, after shares tumbled Monday in the latest downward lurch for a stock down more than 60% this year . The action marks a setback for a business that has seen its luster fade in a corner of the retail market encompassing reverse logistics and warehouse-style sales. Overstock since last year has been emphasizing its ties to crypto assets and the blockchain technology associated with them. The offering was sold as one of the strategic options the company had been exploring. With retail revenue down and crypto-related investments leading to losses, the company has been exploring options, including the sale of its e-commerce business. Overstock last year was looking to step up its online sales game, with reports that it was in talks with a big logistics provider to offer two-day delivery of bulky items.\nECONOMY & TRADE The Port of Oakland. Photo: Bloomberg News Growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector is coming at a higher price. U.S. factories are reporting robust demand for their products but say rising prices for materials cast a cloud over industrial expansion. The Institute for Supply Management’s latest measure of factory activity settled at 59.3 last month, the WSJ’s Josh Mitchell reports, down one and a half points from a February reading that was the highest in 14 years . But prices for materials also rose nearly four percentage points to the highest level in nearly seven years, and factory operators appear to be taking actions that may slim down manufacturing supply chains. Manufacturer and customer inventories both pulled back, and measures for new orders and production also declined. The survey came before new U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports took effect, suggesting that prices still have room to rise. Factories are still pushing out plenty of goods, but it’s costing more to keep up the pace.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ We continue to struggle with finding carriers and drivers for shipments ’\n—A U.S. food, beverage and tobacco products executive cited in the latest ISM manufacturing report.\nNumber of the Day 96.8% Share of U.S. wine exports by weight to China that go through the Port of Oakland, according to Beacon Economics.\nIN OTHER NEWS The Environmental Protection Agency is easing Obama-era emissions standards for passenger vehicles .
