    "text": "CINCINNATI, April 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Cincinnati Financial Corporation (Nasdaq: CINF) today reported:\nFirst-quarter 2018 net loss of $31 million, or 19 cents per share, compared with $201 million of net income, or $1.21 per share, in the first quarter of 2017, after recognizing a $156 million reduction in the fair value of equity securities still held that prior to 2018 would have been reported in other comprehensive income instead of net income. $22 million increase in non-GAAP operating income* to $120 million, or 72 cents per share, compared with $98 million, or 59 cents per share, in the first quarter of last year. $232 million decrease in first-quarter 2018 net income, reflecting the after-tax net effect of a $254 million decrease in net investment gains. Included in the $254 million decrease in net investment gains was a reduction of $98 million in net gains of securities sold, in addition to the $156 million noted above related to adopting a new accounting standard. $48.42 book value per share at March 31, 2018, down $1.87 or 3.7 percent since year-end. Negative 2.7 percent value creation ratio for the first three months of 2018, compared with positive 3.8 percent for the same period of 2017.\nFinancial Highlights\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data)\nThree months ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n% Change\nRevenue Data\nEarned premiums\n$\n1,260\n$\n1,208\n4\nInvestment income, net of expenses\n150\n149\n1\nTotal revenues\n1,224\n1,523\n(20)\nIncome Statement Data\nNet income (loss)\n$\n(31)\n$\n201\nnm\nInvestment gains and losses, after-tax\n(151)\n103\nnm\nNon-GAAP operating income*\n$\n120\n$\n98\n22\nPer Share Data (diluted)\nNet income (loss)\n$\n(0.19)\n$\n1.21\nnm\nInvestment gains and losses, after-tax\n(0.91)\n0.62\nnm\nNon-GAAP operating income*\n$\n0.72\n$\n0.59\n22\nBook value\n$\n48.42\n$\n44.07\n10\nCash dividend declared\n$\n0.53\n$\n0.50\n6\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding\n164.0\n166.5\n(2)\n*\nThe Definitions of Non-GAAP Information and Reconciliation to Comparable GAAP Measures defines and reconciles measures presented in this release that are not based on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.\n**\nForward-looking statements and related assumptions are subject to the risks outlined in the company's safe harbor statement.\nInsurance Operations First-Quarter Highlights\n97.9 percent first-quarter 2018 property casualty combined ratio, down from 99.7 percent for the first quarter of 2017. 2 percent growth in first-quarter net written premiums, reflecting price increases and premium growth initiatives. $159 million first-quarter 2018 property casualty new business written premiums, up 4 percent. Agencies appointed since the beginning of 2017 contributed $14 million or 9 percent of total new business written premiums. $13 million of life insurance subsidiary net income, up less than $1 million from first-quarter 2017, and 8 percent growth in first-quarter 2018 term life insurance earned premiums.\nInvestment and Balance Sheet Highlights\n1 percent or $1 million increase in first-quarter 2018 pretax investment income, including an 8 percent increase for stock portfolio dividends and a 1 percent decrease for bond interest income. Three-month decrease of 2 percent in fair value of total investments at March 31, 2018, including a 3 percent decrease for the stock portfolio and a decrease of 2 percent for the bond portfolio. $2.494 billion parent company cash and marketable securities at March 31, 2018, down less than 1 percent from year-end 2017.\nProperty Casualty Underwriting Producing Steady Results\nSteven J. Johnston, president and chief executive officer, commented: \"Non-GAAP operating income started the year strong, increasing 22 percent compared with last year's first-quarter result. While our swing in net income may be surprising to some, it's mostly due to a change in accounting rules as required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. This was the first quarter we had to recognize investment gains or losses on all equity securities we still hold as part of net income. In the past, these gains or losses would have been reported in other comprehensive income.\n\"Going forward, this accounting change will produce more volatility than we are used to seeing in our net income results. While this quarter it had a negative effect, if this rule would have been in place at the end of last year, our fourth quarter net income would have increased by $256 million.\n\"Turning to our insurance business, property casualty underwriting continued to produce steady results as our first quarter combined ratio improved 1.8 points to 97.9 percent compared with first-quarter 2017. While lower weather-related catastrophes helped the combined ratio this quarter by nearly 5 points, an increase in losses caused by weather, but not part of a named catastrophe event for the industry, contributed 6.4 points to the first quarter ratio this year compared with 2.9 points a year ago.\n\"Looking through to our results without the effects of those weather-related losses, our combined ratio decreased by half of a percentage point compared with first-quarter 2017. That decrease helps to show the steady, ongoing benefits of our initiatives to improve profitability through pricing precision and the use of predictive analytics.\"\nBalancing Growth and Profitability\n\"Net written premiums for our property casualty business grew 2 percent in the quarter with growth in our personal lines business up 9 percent and our excess and surplus lines business up 15 percent, both compared to first-quarter 2017. Our commercial lines business experienced a small decline in net written premiums for the quarter due to a combination of underwriting discipline and timing of renewals for larger accounts.\n\"We've grown faster than the industry in each of the past 5 years. And, we believe we can sustain that trend as we continue to execute on our premium growth strategies. Already in 2018, we've appointed 46 new agencies, written $15 million in new business for our agencies' high net worth personal lines customers and grown net written premiums through Cincinnati Re SM by 15 percent.\n\"We now have relationships with 1,724 premier independent agencies. We're confident in the abilities of our teams of associates – both in the field and at our headquarters – to fulfill the promise we make to deliver outstanding customer service, earning our agents' best business and balancing growth and profitability for the long-term.\"\nFocusing on a Long-Term Investment Strategy\n\"Downward pressure in both the equity and bond markets contributed to a 3.7 percent decline in book value to $48.42 per share at March 31 compared with year-end 2017. Despite this movement, we estimate that our total portfolio still holds nearly $3 billion in appreciated value before taxes.\n\"We maintain a long-term perspective with our investment philosophy and aren't swayed by periodic market volatility. Our insurance business continues to provide cash that we invest in high-quality bonds and dividend-paying stocks. We are poised to further benefit from these purchases when the markets rebound.\"\nInsurance Operations Highlights\nConsolidated Property Casualty Insurance Results\n(Dollars in millions)\nThree months ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n% Change\nEarned premiums\n$\n1,200\n$\n1,151\n4\nFee revenues\n3\n3\n0\nTotal revenues\n1,203\n1,154\n4\nLoss and loss expenses\n791\n788\n0\nUnderwriting expenses\n383\n360\n6\nUnderwriting profit\n$\n29\n$\n6\n383\nRatios as a percent of earned premiums:\nPt.

The ultimate changes and eventual effects, if any, of these initiatives are uncertain.\n* * *\nCincinnati Financial Corporation\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and Statements of Income (unaudited)\n(Dollars in millions)\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\n2018\n2017\nAssets\nInvestments\n$\n16,721\n$\n17,051\nCash and cash equivalents\n604\n657\nPremiums receivable\n1,626\n1,589\nReinsurance recoverable\n423\n432\nDeferred policy acquisition costs\n691\n670\nOther assets\n1,405\n1,444\nTotal assets\n$\n21,470\n$\n21,843\nLiabilities\nInsurance reserves\n$\n8,085\n$\n8,002\nUnearned premiums\n2,459\n2,404\nDeferred income tax\n652\n745\nLong-term debt and capital lease obligations\n829\n827\nOther liabilities\n1,499\n1,622\nTotal liabilities\n13,524\n13,600\nShareholders' Equity\nCommon stock and paid-in capital\n1,655\n1,662\nRetained earnings\n7,565\n5,180\nAccumulated other comprehensive income\n115\n2,788\nTreasury stock\n(1,389)\n(1,387)\nTotal shareholders' equity\n7,946\n8,243\nTotal liabilities and shareholders' equity\n$\n21,470\n$\n21,843\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data)\nThree months ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nRevenues\nEarned premiums\n$\n1,260\n$\n1,208\nInvestment income, net of expenses\n150\n149\nInvestment gains and losses, net\n(191)\n160\nOther revenues\n5\n6\nTotal revenues\n1,224\n1,523\nBenefits and Expenses\nInsurance losses and contract holders' benefits\n854\n853\nUnderwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses\n403\n377\nInterest expense\n13\n13\nOther operating expenses\n4\n4\nTotal benefits and expenses\n1,274\n1,247\nIncome (Loss) Before Income Taxes\n(50)\n276\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\n(19)\n75\nNet Income (Loss)\n$\n(31)\n$\n201\nPer Common Share:\nNet income (loss)—basic\n$\n(0.19)\n$\n1.22\nNet income (loss)—diluted\n(0.19)\n1.21\nDefinitions of Non-GAAP Information and Reconciliation to Comparable GAAP Measures\n(See attached tables for reconciliations; additional prior-period reconciliations available at cinfin.com/investors .)\nCincinnati Financial Corporation prepares its public financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Statutory data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules as defined by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' (NAIC) Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP data.\nManagement uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its primary business areas – property casualty insurance, life insurance and investments. Management uses these measures when analyzing both GAAP and non-GAAP results to improve its understanding of trends in the underlying business and to help avoid incorrect or misleading assumptions and conclusions about the success or failure of company strategies. Management adjustments to GAAP measures generally: apply to non-recurring events that are unrelated to business performance and distort short-term results; involve values that fluctuate based on events outside of management's control; supplement reporting segment disclosures with disclosures for a subsidiary company or for a combination of subsidiaries or reporting segments; or relate to accounting refinements that affect comparability between periods, creating a need to analyze data on the same basis.\nNon-GAAP operating income: Non-GAAP operating income is calculated by excluding investment gains and losses (defined as investment gains and losses after applicable federal and state income taxes) and other significant non-recurring items from net income. Management evaluates non-GAAP operating income to measure the success of pricing, rate and underwriting strategies. While investment gains (or losses) are integral to the company's insurance operations over the long term, the determination to realize investment gains or losses on fixed-maturity securities sold in any period may be subject to management's discretion and is independent of the insurance underwriting process. Also, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, gains and losses are recognized from certain changes in market values of securities without actual realization. Management believes that the level of investment gains or losses for any particular period, while it may be material, may not fully indicate the performance of ongoing underlying business operations in that period.\nFor these reasons, many investors and shareholders consider non-GAAP operating income to be one of the more meaningful measures for evaluating insurance company performance. Equity analysts who report on the insurance industry and the company generally focus on this metric in their analyses. The company presents non-GAAP operating income so that all investors have what management believes to be a useful supplement to GAAP information. Consolidated property casualty insurance results: To supplement reporting segment disclosures related to our property casualty insurance operations, we also evaluate results for those operations on a basis that includes results for our property casualty insurance and brokerage services subsidiaries. That is the total of our commercial lines, personal lines and our excess and surplus lines segment plus our reinsurance assumed operations. Life insurance subsidiary results: To supplement life insurance reporting segment disclosures related to our life insurance operation, we also evaluate results for that operation on a basis that includes life insurance subsidiary investment income, or investment income plus investment gains and losses, that are also included in our investments reporting segment. We recognize that assets under management, capital appreciation and investment income are integral to evaluating the success of the life insurance segment because of the long duration of life products.\nCincinnati Financial Corporation\nNet Income (Loss) Reconciliation\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data)\nThree months ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet income (loss)\n$\n(31)\n$\n201\nLess:\nInvestment gains and losses, net\n(191)\n160\nIncome tax on investment gains and losses\n40\n(57)\nInvestment gains and losses, after-tax\n(151)\n103\nNon-GAAP operating income\n$\n120\n$\n98\nDiluted per share data:\nNet income (loss)\n$\n(0.19)\n$\n1.21\nLess:\nInvestment gains and losses, net\n(1.16)\n0.96\nIncome tax on investment gains and losses\n0.25\n(0.34)\nInvestment gains and losses, after-tax\n(0.91)\n0.62\nNon-GAAP operating income\n$\n0.72\n$\n0.59\nLife Insurance Reconciliation\n(Dollars in millions)\nThree months ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet income of the life insurance subsidiary\n$\n13\n$\n13\nInvestment gains and losses, net\n—\n4\nIncome tax on investment gains and losses\n—\n1\nNon-GAAP operating income\n13\n10\nInvestment income, net of expenses\n(38)\n(39)\nInvestment income credited to contract holders'\n24\n23\nIncome tax excluding tax on investment gains and losses, net\n3\n6\nLife insurance segment profit\n$\n2\n$\n—\nCincinnati Financial Corporation\nOther Measures\nValue creation ratio: This is a measure of shareholder value creation that management believes captures the contribution of the company's insurance operations, the success of its investment strategy and the importance placed on paying cash dividends to shareholders. The value creation ratio measure is made up of two primary components: (1) rate of growth in book value per share plus (2) the ratio of dividends declared per share to beginning book value per share. Management believes this measure is useful, providing a meaningful measure of long-term progress in creating shareholder value. It is intended to be all-inclusive regarding changes in book value per share, and uses originally reported book value per share in cases where book value per share has been adjusted, such as adoption of Accounting Standards Updates with a cumulative effect of a change in accounting. Statutory accounting rules: For public reporting, insurance companies prepare financial statements in accordance with GAAP. However, insurers also must calculate certain data according to statutory accounting rules as defined in the NAIC's Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, which may be, and has been, modified by various state insurance departments and differ from GAAP. Statutory data is publicly available, and various organizations use it to calculate aggregate industry data, study industry trends and compare insurance companies. Written premium: Under statutory accounting rules, property casualty written premium is the amount recorded for policies issued and recognized on an annualized basis at the effective date of the policy. Management analyzes trends in written premium to assess business efforts. Earned premium, used in both statutory and GAAP accounting, is calculated ratably over the policy term. The difference between written and earned premium is unearned premium.\nValue Creation Ratio Calculations\n(Dollars are per share)\nThree months ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nValue creation ratio:\nEnd of period book value*\n$\n48.42\n$\n44.07\nLess beginning of period book value\n50.29\n42.95\nChange in book value\n(1.87)\n1.12\nDividend declared to shareholders\n0.53\n0.50\nTotal value creation\n$\n(1.34)\n$\n1.62\nValue creation ratio from change in book value**\n(3.7)\n%\n2.6\n%\nValue creation ratio from dividends declared to shareholders***\n1.0\n1.2\nValue creation ratio\n(2.7)\n%\n3.8\n%\n* Book value per share is calculated by dividing end of period total shareholders' equity by end of period shares outstanding\n** Change in book value divided by the beginning of period book value\n*** Dividend declared to shareholders divided by beginning of period book value\nCincinnati Financial Corporation\nProperty Casualty Insurance Reconciliation\n(Dollars in millions)\nThree months ended March 31, 2018\nConsolidated\nCommercial\nPersonal\nE&S\nCincinnati Re\nPremiums:\nWritten premiums\n$\n1,258\n$\n854\n$\n297\n$\n61\n$\n46\nUnearned premiums change\n(58)\n(64)\n28\n(5)\n(17)\nEarned premiums\n$\n1,200\n$\n790\n$\n325\n$\n56\n$\n29\nStatutory ratios:\nCombined ratio\n96.4\n%\n96.1\n%\n104.6\n%\n67.3\n%\n70.6\n%\nContribution from catastrophe losses\n4.4\n2.9\n8.9\n1.9\n(0.3)\nCombined ratio excluding catastrophe losses\n92.0\n%\n93.2\n%\n95.7\n%\n65.4\n%\n70.9\n%\nCommission expense ratio\n18.0\n%\n17.0\n%\n19.2\n%\n24.4\n%\n20.4\n%\nOther underwriting expense ratio\n12.4\n13.5\n12.1\n3.6\n6.4\nTotal expense ratio\n30.4\n%\n30.5\n%\n31.3\n%\n28.0\n%\n26.8\n%\nGAAP ratios:\nCombined ratio\n97.9\n%\n98.3\n%\n103.2\n%\n68.8\n%\n81.8\n%\nContribution from catastrophe losses\n4.4\n2.9\n8.9\n1.9\n(0.3)\nPrior accident years before catastrophe losses\n(3.3)\n(3.5)\n(0.1)\n(17.2)\n(9.3)\nCurrent accident year combined ratio before\ncatastrophe losses\n96.8\n%\n98.9\n%\n94.4\n%\n84.1\n%\n91.4\n%\nDollar amounts shown are rounded to millions; certain amounts may not add due to rounding.
