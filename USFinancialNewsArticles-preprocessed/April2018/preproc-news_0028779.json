    "text": "April 12 (Reuters) - New Jersey Senate on Thursday passed a bill that would cost about $300 million a year to subsidize three nuclear reactors operated by New Jersey power company Public Service Enterprise Group Inc, a source familiar with the development said.\n“The bill passed the New Jersey Senate by a vote of 29-7. ... We are awaiting action in the assembly,” the source said.\nPSEG had said it could shut the reactors - two at Salem and one at Hope Creek - in a couple of years if they do not receive some sort of federal or state assistance.
