    "text": "April 9, 2018 / 8:19 PM / Updated 39 minutes ago War crimes prosecutor seeks jurisdiction over Rohingya deportations Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nAMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) has asked it to rule on whether it had jurisdiction over the deportations of Rohingya people from Myanmar to Bangladesh, a possible war crime, according to a filing published on Monday. FILE PHOTO - Fatou Bensouda, Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), poses for pictures at the European Council in Brussels, Belgium, January 26, 2017. REUTERS/Eric Vidal \nProsecutor Fatou Bensouda said in the filing that doubt over jurisidiction arises because Bangladesh is a member of the court but Myanmar is not. \nBensouda argued that, given the cross-border nature of the crime of deportation, a ruling in favour of ICC jurisdiction would be in line with established principles of criminal law.
