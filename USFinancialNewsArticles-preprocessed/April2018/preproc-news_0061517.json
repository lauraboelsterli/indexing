    "text": " 09 PM / Updated 26 minutes ago McDonald's global same-restaurant sales tops estimates Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\n(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp ( MCD.N ) reported a better-than-expected rise in quarterly sales at its restaurants on Monday, helped by strong international sales, especially in the UK and Germany, sending its shares up 3.6 percent. FILE PHOTO: A sign for the U.S. fast food restaurant chain McDonald's is seen outside one of their restaurants in Sint-Pieters-Leeuw, near Brussels, Belgium February 14, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo\nGlobal sales at stores open at least 13 months rose 5.5 percent, easily topping the average analyst estimate of 3.94 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nSame-store sales for what it calls its international lead markets - comprising Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the United Kingdom - rose 7.8 percent, surging past analysts’ expectation of a 5.30 percent gain.\nSales at McDonald’s U.S. restaurants also topped estimates due to higher menu prices and an increase in customer visits.\nExcluding items, the company earned $1.79 per share, beating the estimate of $1.67.\nNet income rose to $1.38 billion (1 billion pounds), or $1.72 per share, from $1.21 billion, or $1.47 per share, a year earlier.\nRevenue fell 9 percent to $5.14 billion, but edged past the estimate of $4.98 billion.
