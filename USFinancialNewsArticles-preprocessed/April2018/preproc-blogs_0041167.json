Photo: European Pressphoto Agency \nEvery weekend we select a handful of in-depth articles we think are worth a bit of your time, either because they peel back the layers on a compelling business story, or somehow make us look at business in a different light. \nHow Palantir gets to know everything about you. Palantir Technologies Inc.’s engineers and products don’t do any spying themselves; they’re more like a spy’s brain. The software combs through disparate data sources and searches for connections that human analysts might miss. It then presents the linkages in colorful, easy-to-interpret graphics that look like spider webs, reports Bloomberg Businessweek.\nWhat to think of before hiring a friend. You can be a friend and a boss, assuming that you have the right combination of patience and candor before and during the hiring process, argues Harvard Business Review.\nHow to cram in more media. Unread books. Unheard music albums. Unwatched films and television series, plus a heap of audiobooks: The amount of media content you think you cannot miss can be overwhelming. The Financial Times explains how to get more media into your day.\nShare this: the weekend reader Previous The Morning Ledger: Trade Spat Affects U.S., Chinese Tech Companies Next CFO Moves: Bloomsbury Publishing, Debenhams  ",
