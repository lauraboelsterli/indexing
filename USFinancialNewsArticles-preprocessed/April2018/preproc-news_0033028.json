    "text": "NEW YORK, April 18, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Checkpoint Therapeutics, Inc. (“Checkpoint”) (NASDAQ:CKPT), a clinical-stage, immuno-oncology biopharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel treatments for patients with solid tumor cancers, announced that preclinical data supporting the clinical development of its BET inhibitor CK-103 (also known as TG-1601) will be presented today in a poster session at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting in Chicago, Illinois, at McCormick Place North/South. The Company’s poster is available for viewing today from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. CT, during the Experimental and Molecular Therapeutics/ Canonical Targets 2 Session in Exhibit Hall A.\nKey conclusions from the poster are as follows:\nTG-1601 is a novel BET inhibitor with strong binding affinity and long-lasting effect in preclinical models\nCK-103 is a novel and potent BET inhibitor that specifically inhibits the binding of the BET sub-family of bromodomain-containing protein family; CK-103 potently inhibits cell growth of various multiple myeloma and lymphoma cell lines in vitro , but does not affect the growth of normal cell lines; CK-103 inhibits MYC and Bcl-2 expression in preclinical models; and CK-103 showed combinatorial effects in an in vivo model with anti-PD-1 antibodies.\nJames F. Oliviero, President and Chief Executive Officer of Checkpoint, said, “These data demonstrate CK-103’s potential to be a novel BET inhibitor that potently inhibits MYC expression. Elevated levels of MYC proteins are found in 60-70% of all cancers, making this family of oncogenes a promising therapeutic target. We believe the preclinical data presented today provides encouraging evidence to support the development of CK-103 as an anti-cancer agent, alone and in combination with our anti-PD-L1 antibody, and look forward to the advancement of CK-103 into a first-in-human Phase 1 trial expected to commence later this year.”\nThe poster is available on the Publications page in the Pipeline section of Checkpoint’s website, www.checkpointtx.com .\nAbout Checkpoint Therapeutics\nCheckpoint Therapeutics, Inc. (“Checkpoint”) is a clinical-stage, immuno-oncology biopharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel treatments for patients with solid tumor cancers. Checkpoint is currently evaluating its lead antibody product candidate, CK-301, an anti-PD-L1 antibody licensed from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, in a Phase 1 clinical trial in checkpoint therapy-naïve patients with selected recurrent or metastatic cancers. Checkpoint plans to develop CK-301 as a treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) and other solid tumors. In addition, Checkpoint is evaluating its lead small-molecule, targeted anti-cancer product candidate, CK-101, in the Phase 1 portion of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (“EGFR”) mutation-positive NSCLC. Checkpoint’s pipeline also includes antibodies that target glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related protein (“GITR”) and carbonic anhydrase IX (“CAIX”), in addition to oral, small-molecule, targeted anti-cancer agents that inhibit bromodomain and extra-terminal (“BET”) proteins and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (“PARP”).
