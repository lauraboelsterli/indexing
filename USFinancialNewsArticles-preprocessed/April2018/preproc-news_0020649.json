    "text": "JAKARTA (Reuters) - Former Indonesian general Prabowo Subianto has accepted the endorsement of the main opposition party to stand as a candidate in a presidential election next year, setting the stage for a rematch with President Joko Widodo.\nFILE PHOTO: Indonesia's losing presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto waves as he leaves the Constitutional Court in Jakarta August 6, 2014. REUTERS/Darren Whiteside/File Photo Subianto, who narrowly lost the election, in 2014, to Widodo, is chairman of the nationalist Gerindra Party which forms the main opposition alongside two Islamic parties.\n“We have affirmed that Mr Prabowo is ready to be a presidential candidate and has received the party’s mandate to proceed as presidential candidate in 2019,” Gerindra deputy chairman Arief Poyuono said by telephone from a party meeting.\nGerindra spokesman Irawan Ronodipuro said Subianto had accepted the party’s mandate on Wednesday evening.\nA presidential candidate needs the support of parties that together won 25 percent of the national vote in the previous legislative election or have 20 percent of seats in parliament.\nWidodo, a former furniture salesman, is Indonesia’s first president to come from outside the political and military elite. He has gained the support of five parties and is currently well ahead in most opinion polls.\nAn Indo Barometer Survey conducted in late January gave Widodo 48.8 percent support, with Subianto at 22.3 percent and 28.9 percent undecided.\nWhile in office, Widodo has led a push to build infrastructure though annual growth in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy, at about 5 percent, has yet to reach the 7 percent he pledged when campaigning in 2014.\nSubianto appeared to improve his political prospects last year after backing a successful challenge by former education minister Anies Baswedan to win the powerful post of Jakarta governor.\nBut the bitterly fought campaign to unseat the ethnic Chinese, Christian governor, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, a close ally of Widodo, exposed deep religious and ethnic divisions in the world’s biggest Muslim-majority country.\nWriting by Fergus Jensen; Editing by Nick Macfie, Robert Birsel\n ",
