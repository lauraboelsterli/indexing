The logo of Uber is pictured during the presentation of their new security measures in Mexico City, Mexico April 10, 2018. REUTERS/Ginnette Riquelme \nThe Silicon Valley startup is in advanced talks with Rowe, who is currently CFO at VMware, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. bloom.bg/2qG6c4C \nAn agreement has not been finalised yet and talks could still fall through, Bloomberg said citing one of the sources. \nUber’s board of directors has agreed to take the company public in 2019 and is searching for a chief financial officer to lead this effort. The position has been vacant since 2015. \nVMware declined to comment. Uber was not immediately available for comment outside regular U.S. business hours.
