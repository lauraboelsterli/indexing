    "text": "ISLANDIA, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Gold Coast Bancorp, Inc. (OTC:GLDT) (“Gold Coast”), the holding company of Gold Coast Bank, known as “Long Island’s Community Bank” sm , (the”Bank”) today reported net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 of $ 531,000, or $0.14 per share compared with net income of $515,000, or $0.13 per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Return on average assets and return on average equity was 0.43 percent and 5.14 percent, respectively, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 0.48 percent and 5.15 percent in the 2017 first quarter.\nTotal assets at March 31, 2018 were $509 million, an increase of $39 million, or 8 percent from total assets of $470 million at December 31, 2017. Total assets increased $66 million, or 15 percent from $443 million at March 31, 2017.\nDeposits at March 31, 2018 totaled $424 million, an increase of $32 million, or 8 percent from $392 million at December 31, 2017. Total deposits increased $36 million, or 9 percent from $388 million at March 31, 2017. Non-interest bearing demand deposits were 25 percent of the total deposit portfolio at both March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, compared to 28 percent of the total deposit portfolio at March 31, 2017. FHLB borrowings were $25 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $20 million at December 31, 2017 and $10 million at March 31, 2017, respectively.\nTotal loans outstanding at March 31, 2018 were $391 million, an increase of $10 million, or 3 percent from $381 million at December 31, 2017 and an increase of $47 million, or 14 percent from $344 million at March 31, 2017. Loan originations and draws were $31 million in both the first quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2017. The bank experienced loan repayments and pay downs of $21 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $28 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nAsset quality continues to remain strong: The Bank’s nonperforming loans were 0.02 percent of gross loans at March 31, 2018. Allowance for loan losses was 1.01 percent of total loans at March 31, 2018.\nThe Bank remained well capitalized at March 31, 2018, with the following regulatory capital ratios:\n- Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio of 11.1 percent.\n- Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital and Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratios of 15.3 percent.\n- Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 16.4 percent.\nAt March 31, 2018 book value per share was $10.70 per share, increasing from $10.69 per share at December 31, 2017 and $10.43 per share at March 31, 2017.\nNet interest income grew $258,000, or 8 percent in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017, largely due to a 13 percent increase in average interest earning assets, partially offset by a decrease in the net interest margin to 2.88 percent in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 3.12 percent in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in the Bank’s net interest margin is largely due to an increase in the Bank’s cost of funds, primarily due to the issuance of $13.5 million of 6.50% subordinated notes on September 29, 2017. The provision for loan losses was $80,000 in the three months ended March 31, 2018. There was no provision required in the 2017 first quarter.\nNon-interest income was $107,000 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $99,000 in the first quarter of 2017. Non-interest expense increased $305,000, or 12 percent in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 , largely due to the opening of the Bank’s newest branch in Brooklyn in April 2017 and the addition of staff to support the bank’s expanded lending activities in the NYC metropolitan area.\nJohn C. Tsunis, Chairman and CEO stated, “The successful issuance of our subordinated debt last year has allowed us to expand our balance sheet these past six months, and grow our loan portfolio as interest rates rise. Notwithstanding the challenging interest rate environment for new loans, as well as higher costs for deposits, we believe that with prudent management and continuing investment in our technology and personal infrastructure, our balance sheet and net income will continue to grow in a prudent and balanced fashion. The Bank’s deposits, the lifeblood of our industry, have accelerated as our customer base, in our trade area, has become aware of our bank’s certificate of deposit program, allowing for longer term, stable deposits to fund our growing loan portfolio. We are fiercely determined to execute on our community banking strategy, supporting our neighbors, local community businesses, and not-for-profit corporations that make our communities special. We are grateful for their support and we in turn reinvest their deposits LOCALLY and not outside of our trade area or country.”\nAbout Gold Coast Bancorp, Inc.\nGold Coast Bancorp, Inc. is the holding company for Gold Coast Bank .
