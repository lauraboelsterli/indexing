    "text": "A fast-moving spring snowstorm swept through parts of the Northeast, spreading a wintry mix that made for a slow and slushy commute to start the work week.\nThe storm stretched from Ohio to coastal southern New England early Monday and was expected to drop 2 to 6 inches of snow on parts of the area, while other areas saw accumulation only on grassy surfaces. A winter weather advisory was in effect in New York , and a steady snow forced the Yankees to postpone their scheduled 1:05 p.m. home opener against Tampa Bay.\nSome school districts closed for the day and others opted for a delayed opening while others are on spring break.\nCommuters using NJ Transit may also experience some delays.\n@NJTRANSIT delays tweet \nIn the New York City area, LaGuardia, Kennedy and Newark Liberty airports all reported some flight disruptions.\n@JFKairport departure and arrival update tweet \n@EWRairport delays and cancellation tweet \nAmerican Airlines released a statement saying that while airports in the New York City-area are now open, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued ground stops and ground delay programs. \nThe airline also stated that 110 flights throughout the Northeast were canceled out of the 6318 schedule. \nThe storm was forecast to move off the coast later in the day, giving way to gradually warming temperatures and melting.\nMonday's snowstorm was the fifth to move through the area after four nor'easters in March.\n--CNBC.com's Tamanna Desai contributed to this report.",
