REUTERS/David Gray 1148 EARL OF WESSEX CLOSES GAMES Queen Elizabeth’s youngest son Prince Edward called on the athletes to gather again in Birmingham in four years time before officially closing the XXI Games.\n“Every four years these Games bring the spirit of our Commonwealth alive,” the Prince said.\n“They express friendship between nations and the desire to share our common values and our common wealth for the good of humanity and the peace of the world.\n“So I call sportsmen and women from all countries and territories of the Commonwealth to come together in four years’ time in Birmingham, England, to celebrate the 22nd Commonwealth Games.\n“Until then, in the name of the Commonwealth Games Federation, I proclaim Gold Coast 2018 closed.”\n1123 CGF PRESIDENT MARTIN HANDS FLAG TO NEXT HOSTS Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) President Louise Martin thanked the organizers, volunteers, various levels of government, athletes and sponsors for their input to the Games before handing the flag over to the next hosts.\nEnglish city Birmingham were awarded the next Games in 2022 after original hosts Durban were stripped of the multi-sport event for failing to meet CGF deadlines.\n“Congratulations Gold Coast, congratulations Queensland and congratulations Australia,” Martin said before the flag lowering ceremony. “You have truly delivered a golden Games for the Commonwealth.\n“Athletes, 11 days ago I asked you to grasp this opportunity and create your own history and fulfil your dreams. I thank you.\n“What a Games these have been. You have written a new chapter in Commonwealth history.\n“On behalf of the Commonwealth Games family, thank you Gold Coast, thank you athletes and thank you all.”\n0856 NEW ZEALAND MEN MATCH WOMEN WITH RUGBY SEVENS GOLD New Zealand rugby sevens captain Tim Mikkelson said watching the women’s team beat Australia in the final had inspired the men to a 14-0 victory against Fiji.\n“It’s pretty satisfying. We watched the women go into overtime and their win at the end really inspired us to get the double,” Mikkelson said.\n“Not many guys in this team would know the feeling of a gold medal. I got one in Delhi (2010 Commonwealth Games) and was part of the team that lost in Glasgow (2014), so to get this win is amazing,” he added.\n0530 NEW ZEALAND WOMEN CLAIM RUGBY SEVENS GOLD A try in sudden-death extra time by Kelly Brazier helped New Zealand beat Olympic champions Australia 17-12 to clinch the first Commonwealth Games women’s rugby sevens gold medal.\nGold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games - Closing Ceremony - Carrara Stadium - Gold Coast, Australia - April 15, 2018.

It could have gone either way. Today I felt very calm,” Gao said.\n“Twice I’ve been the runner up, now the winner but at the Commonwealth Games I’ve won men’s team and men’s doubles gold medals...
