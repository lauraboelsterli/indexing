    "text": "April 3 (Reuters) - Japanese government bonds rose on Tuesday as worries over U.S.-China trade tensions weighed on equities, with the bond market receiving an added boost as an auction of 10-year JGBs attracted solid demand.\nThe key June 10-year JGB futures contract finished 0.16 point higher at 150.97, clocking its biggest one-day rise in nearly a month.\nThe Finance Ministry offered 2.2 trillion yen ($20.75 billion) in 10-year JGBs on Tuesday with a coupon rate of 0.1 percent, in a re-opening of the 350th 10-year JGB.\nThe bid-to-cover ratio was 4.16, down slightly from 4.53 at the previous 10-year JGB auction, but still high enough to suggest that demand at Mondayâ€™s auction was robust.\nYields on long-term and super-long JGBs fell, with the benchmark 10-year JGB yield slipping 1.5 basis point to 0.025 percent.\nThe 20-year JGB yield fell 2 basis points to 0.505 percent, the lowest level in almost 16 months.\nThe 30-year JGB yield set a 15-month low of 0.715 percent, falling 2.5 basis points on the day.\nThe 40-year JGB yield also hit a 15-month low at 0.855 percent, down 2 basis points on the day.
