    "text": "1Q18 Reported EPS of $1.40 Adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) of $1.44 1Q18 Net sales increased 13.0% to $1.78 billion Sales change ex. currency (non-GAAP) of 6.8% Organic sales change (non-GAAP) of 3.4% FY18 Reported EPS guidance midpoint reduced by $0.63, reflecting higher anticipated restructuring charges Raised FY18 guidance midpoint for Adjusted EPS by $0.13\nGLENDALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Avery Dennison Corporation (NYSE:AVY) today announced preliminary, unaudited results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018. All non-GAAP financial measures referenced in this document are reconciled to GAAP in the attached tables. Unless otherwise indicated, comparisons are to the same period in the prior year.\n“We are off to a good start to the year, with adjusted EPS up 30 percent driven by a combination of solid operating results, currency translation tailwinds, and a lower tax rate,” said Mitch Butier, President and CEO. “Label and Graphic Materials delivered solid organic growth and sustained its strong operating margin; Retail Branding and Information Solutions expanded its margin significantly, with solid organic growth driven by strength in RFID; and Industrial and Healthcare Materials results were in line with expectations, with revenue up nearly 50 percent, largely due to acquisitions, while operating margin declined.\n“We have initiated a large, multi-year restructuring plan associated with the consolidation of LGM’s European footprint, designed to further enhance our competitive position in the region,” said Butier. “Excluding the incremental charges from this action, our current year outlook has improved, reflecting a continuation of strong operating performance and an increased benefit from currency translation.”\nFor more details on the company’s results, see the summary table accompanying this news release, as well as the supplemental presentation materials, “First Quarter 2018 Financial Review and Analysis,” posted on the company’s website at www.investors.averydennison.com , and furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results by Segment\nSales change ex. currency refers to the increase or decrease in sales excluding the estimated impact of foreign currency translation. The estimated impact of foreign currency translation is calculated on a constant currency basis, with prior period results translated at current period average exchange rates to exclude the effect of currency fluctuations. Organic sales change refers to the increase or decrease in sales excluding the estimated impact of foreign currency translation, product line exits, and acquisitions and divestitures. Adjusted operating margin refers to income before interest expense, other non-operating expense, and taxes, excluding restructuring charges and other items, as a percentage of sales.\nLabel and Graphic Materials\nReported sales increased 11.8 percent. Sales ex. currency increased 4.2 percent; on an organic basis, sales grew 3.6 percent. Sales on an organic basis increased mid-single digits in Label and Packaging Materials and increased low-single digits in the combined Graphics and Reflective Solutions businesses. Reported operating margin decreased 30 basis points to 12.3 percent, reflecting the impact of restructuring actions. Adjusted operating margin increased 20 basis points to 13.0 percent as the benefits of increased volume and productivity more than offset higher employee-related costs and the net impact of pricing and raw material costs.\nRetail Branding and Information Solutions\nReported sales increased 5.2 percent; on an organic basis, sales grew 3.1 percent driven by strength in radio frequency identification (RFID) solutions. Reported operating margin increased 160 basis points to 9.0 percent as the benefits from productivity, reduced amortization expense, and increased volume were partially offset by higher employee-related costs and investments. Adjusted operating margin increased 170 basis points to 10.2 percent.\nIndustrial and Healthcare Materials\nReported sales increased 48.8 percent. Sales ex. currency increased 42.2 percent; on an organic basis, sales grew 2.8 percent. Sales in industrial categories grew more than 50 percent ex. currency and mid-single digits on an organic basis. Sales in healthcare categories grew roughly 10 percent ex. currency and were relatively unchanged on an organic basis. Reported operating margin declined 390 basis points to 7.5 percent as the impact of acquisitions, increased investments, and the net impact of pricing and raw material costs were partially offset by increased volume. Adjusted operating margin declined 430 basis points to 7.5 percent.\nOther\nShare Repurchases / Equity Dilution\nThe company repurchased 0.4 million shares in the first quarter at an aggregate cost of $52 million. Net of dilution from long-term incentives, the company’s share count decreased 0.2 million in the quarter.\nIncome Taxes\nThe first quarter effective tax rate was 20.9 percent, up from 17.4 percent in the prior year. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 25 percent, consistent with the company’s expectation for the full year tax rate.\nCost Reduction Actions\nIn the first quarter, the company realized approximately $11 million in pretax savings from restructuring, net of transition costs, and incurred pretax restructuring charges of approximately $13 million, roughly half of which represented cash charges.\nThe company approved a restructuring plan associated with the consolidation of the European footprint of its Label and Graphic Materials segment, which is expected to result in a net reduction in headcount of approximately 150 positions. The company expects this plan to be largely complete by the end of 2019.\nTotal pretax restructuring charges associated with this plan are estimated at approximately $70 million. Of these charges, $6.9 million represents non-cash asset impairment charges, all of which were recorded in the first quarter of 2018. The remaining charges, which relate to cash costs primarily for severance, will largely be recognized during the second quarter of 2018; the vast majority of the cash payments associated with these accruals will be made in 2019.\nThe company expects to realize approximately $25 million in annualized savings from this plan, beginning in 2020.\nPension Accounting Change\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the company adopted ASU 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, on a retrospective basis. This ASU requires the net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit plans, other than service cost, to be presented below operating income. These changes in presentation do not change net income or earnings per share, but have a modest favorable impact on both reported and adjusted operating margins for the total company and its segments.\nA summary of historical reclassified results, “Supplemental Historical Results (ASU 2017-07 Reclassification),” has been posted on the company’s website at www.investors.averydennison.com .\nOutlook\nIn its supplemental presentation materials, “First Quarter 2018 Financial Review and Analysis,” the company provides a list of factors that it believes will contribute to its 2018 financial results. Based on the factors listed and other assumptions, the company now expects 2018 reported earnings per share of $4.90 to $5.10. Excluding an estimated $0.95 per share for restructuring charges and other items, the company now expects adjusted earnings per share (non-GAAP) of $5.85 to $6.05.\nNote: Throughout this release and the supplemental presentation materials, amounts on a per share basis reflect fully diluted shares outstanding.\nAbout Avery Dennison\nAvery Dennison (NYSE:AVY) is a global materials science company specializing in the design and manufacture of a wide variety of labeling and functional materials.

This ASU reduces the diversity in the presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. Prior year results have been reclassified as required by the guidance.\nA-4\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Accordance with SEC Regulations G and S-K We report our financial results in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, and also communicate with investors using certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for or superior to, the comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement presentation of our financial results that are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Based upon feedback from investors and financial analysts, we believe that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures we provide are useful to their assessment of our performance and operating trends, as well as liquidity. Our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain events, activities or strategic decisions. The accounting effects of these events, activities or decisions, which are included in the GAAP financial measures, may make it difficult to assess our underlying performance in a single period. By excluding the accounting effects, both positive or negative, of certain items (e.g., restructuring charges, legal settlements, certain effects of strategic transactions and related costs, losses from debt extinguishments, gains and losses from curtailment and settlement of pension obligations, gains or losses on sales of certain assets, and other items), we believe that we are providing meaningful supplemental information that facilitates an understanding of our core operating results and liquidity measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are used internally to evaluate trends in our underlying performance, as well as to facilitate comparison to the results of competitors for a single period. While some of the items we exclude from GAAP financial measures recur, they tend to be disparate in amount, frequency, or timing. We use the following non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying news release and presentation: Sales change ex. currency refers to the increase or decrease in sales excluding the estimated impact of foreign currency translation. The estimated impact of foreign currency translation is calculated on a constant currency basis, with prior period results translated at current period average exchange rates to exclude the effect of currency fluctuations. Organic sales change refers to the increase or decrease in sales excluding the estimated impact of foreign currency translation, product line exits, acquisitions and divestitures, and, where applicable, the extra week in our fiscal year. We believe that sales change ex. currency and organic sales change assist investors in evaluating the sales growth from the ongoing activities of our businesses and provide greater ability to evaluate our results from period to period. Adjusted operating income refers to income before interest expense, other non-operating expense, and taxes, excluding restructuring charges and other items. Adjusted operating margin refers to adjusted operating income as a percentage of sales. Adjusted tax rate refers to our anticipated full-year GAAP tax rate using the most likely scenario in a range of estimated tax rates for the year. This range includes various items such as the impact of the discrete rates applicable to the adjustments we make in calculating our adjusted non-GAAP earnings, changes in uncertain tax positions and our repatriation assertions on unremitted earnings, and other items that may impact our full-year GAAP tax rate. Adjusted net income refers to income before taxes, tax-effected at the adjusted tax rate, and adjusted for tax-effected restructuring charges and other items. Adjusted net income per common share, assuming dilution (adjusted EPS) refers to adjusted net income divided by weighted average number of common shares outstanding, assuming dilution. We believe that adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, and adjusted EPS assist investors in understanding our core operating trends and comparing our results with those of our competitors. Free cash flow refers to cash flow from operations, less payments for property, plant and equipment, software and other deferred charges, plus proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment, plus (minus) net proceeds from sales (purchases) of investments and proceeds from insurance. We believe that free cash flow assists investors by showing the amount of cash we have available for debt reductions, dividends, share repurchases, and acquisitions. The following reconciliations are provided in accordance with Regulations G and S-K and reconcile our non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
