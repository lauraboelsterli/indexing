FILE PHOTO: The logo of Nike (NKE) is seen in Los Angeles, California, United States, April 12, 2016. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo \nNike’s vice president of diversity and inclusion, Antoine Andrews, left earlier this week. Trevor Edwards, president of Nike’s namesake brand, resigned last month, followed by the exit of another vice president Jayme Martin. \nNike, at the time of Edwards’ exit, said there had been “conduct inconsistent with Nike’s core values and against our code of conduct,” but added that there was no direct allegations of misconduct against Edwards. Edwards is continuing as an adviser to Nike CEO until he retires in August. Reporting by Subrat Patnaik in Bengaluru; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier",
