    "text": "0 COMMENTS European dietary supplements won’t cure what ails Procter & Gamble.\nP&G PG -3.00% said Thursday it has agreed to acquire the consumer health business of Germany’s Merck KGaA for $4.2 billion, whose portfolio features a nasal decongestant and various specialty dietary supplements.\nThe deal news came as the Cincinnati consumer products giant released disappointing results for the quarter ending in March. Investors pushed shares down nearly 3% in morning trading.\nOn a conference call, analysts mostly ignored the Merck deal and peppered the company with questions on its sputtering core business. That is appropriate. Perhaps best thing that could be said about the Merck acquisition is that P&G didn’t do a bigger, more distracting deal like one for the consumer health care unit that Pfizer has been trying to sell .\nP&G still needs to come up with a compelling response to fundamental challenges in its home U.S. market. These include retailers pushing for lower prices and private label alternatives, shifts in consumer preferences.\nThese trends have been hitting P&G across the board, but particularly in its shaving and diaper businesses, two historic cash cows. The company highlighted that sales growth has turned positive for Gillette, but only on the back of sharp price reductions last year. Total organic sales for both the grooming and family and baby care segments were each down 3% from a year earlier.\nEven more strikingly, pricing fell in each of the five categories broken out by P&G. This comes as commodity input prices are rising, pushing operating margins down to 20.2% from 21.5% a year earlier.\nMerck’s consumer health care unit will alleviate some of this strain, by adding products with what P&G described as “very attractive margins” and diversifying away from the U.S. market. But the unit’s $1 billion of annual sales will hardly move the needle for a company with more than $66 billion of sales in the last 12 months. There are also signs that the price pressures in household goods are extending to over-the-counter medicines . Merck was looking a while for a buyer before settling for P&G’s offer.\nThe deal comes just after activist investor Nelson Peltz joined the company’s board last month. P&G’s protracted battle with Mr. Peltz made the company look resistant to change, an image it is now trying hard to shed.\nChief Executive David Taylor told analysts Thursday he believes strong product innovation is the solution to rising competitive pressures. “I’ve got my eyes wide open that it is going to take additional funds to do that,” he added, showing the need for cost cutting elsewhere.\nMr. Taylor is right on both points. But he has made little progress in achieving that goal.\nWrite to Aaron Back at aaron.back@wsj.com",
