    "text": "NEW YORK, April 25 (Reuters) - Venture capitalist Peter Thiel on Wednesday abandoned his effort to buy the irreverent news website Gawker.com, as part of a settlement freeing the billionaire from possible lawsuits for having secretly funded litigation that led to its demise.\nThe proposed settlement between Thiel Capital LLC and a liquidator for Gawker Media LLC requires the approval of a judge at the U.S. bankruptcy court in Manhattan.\nIt calls for Thiel to withdraw from efforts to buy Gawker, and release claims against any eventual buyer.\nThe accord clears the way for a sale of Gawker’s remaining assets, including domain names and nearly 200,000 archived articles. Gawker has been inactive since late 2016.\nUnivision Holdings Inc, the media company best known for its Spanish-language broadcasters, bought many Gawker assets, including the Deadspin sports website and feminist blog Jezebel for $135 million in 2016.\nThiel had funded former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan’s lawsuit against Gawker after it published a video of him in a sexual encounter.\nHogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, won a $140 million judgment against Gawker, forcing the website into Chapter 11. He later settled for $31 million. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; editing by Scott Malone)\n ",
