    "text": "HOUSTON, April 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- INDEPENDENCE CONTRACT DRILLING, INC. (the \"Company\") (NYSE: ICD) today reported financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nRecord quarterly revenues of $25.6 million. Net loss of $4.1 million, or $0.11 per share. Adjusted net loss, as defined below, of $4.3 million, or $0.11 per share. Adjusted EBITDA, as defined below, of $3.9 million. Fleet utilization of 100.0%. Revenue days of 1,259. Fully-burdened margin per day of $5,641 per day. Net debt, excluding capitalized leases, of $50.7 million, on a borrowing base of $102.6 million.\nIn 2018, the Company reported record quarterly revenues of $25.6 million, a net loss of $4.1 million, or $0.11 per share, an adjusted net loss (defined below) of $4.3 million, or $0.11 per share, and adjusted EBITDA (defined below) of $3.9 million. This compares to revenues of $25.0 million, a net loss of $5.7 million, or $0.15 per share, an adjusted net loss of $4.6 million, or $0.12 per share, and adjusted EBITDA of $3.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and revenues of $20.2 million, a net loss of $6.3 million, or $0.17 per share, an adjusted net loss of $5.3 million, or $0.14 per share, and adjusted EBITDA of $2.6 million in 2017.\nChief Executive Officer Byron Dunn commented, \"ICD's first quarter continued the trend of full effective utilization of our ShaleDriller fleet. The first quarter also reflected the initial rerating of contracts in backlog to current market conditions, evidenced by sequential improvements in revenue per day. Based upon the contract expiration matrix currently established for 2018, as well as additional opportunities to renew contracts for remaining contract rolls, we are confident this trend will continue throughout 2018. Construction of our next newbuild ShaleDriller has begun and it remains on schedule to enter our drilling fleet mid third quarter\".\nQuarterly Operational Results\nIn 2018, the Company's fleet operated at 100.0% utilization and recorded 1,259 revenue days, compared to 100% utilization and 1,289 revenue days in the fourth quarter of 2017, and 91.7% utilization and 1,073 revenue days in 2017.\nOperating revenues in 2018 totaled $25.6 million, compared to $25.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $20.2 million in 2017. On a revenue per day basis, revenues were $19,055 per day in 2018, compared to $18,338 in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $17,949 in 2017. Sequential revenue per day improvements were driven by increased pricing on contract renewals.\nOperating costs in 2018 totaled $18.9 million, compared to $18.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $14.9 million in 2017. Fully-burdened operating costs, excluding reactivation and rig construction costs, were $13,414 per day in 2018, compared to $13,094 in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $11,930 in 2017. The sequential increase in cost per day related primarily to higher payroll taxes and rig level incentive compensation.\nFirst quarter 2018 fully-burdened rig operating margins, excluding reactivation and rig construction costs, were $5,641 per day, compared to $5,244 per day in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $6,019 per day in 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in 2018 were $3.5 million (including $0.6 million of non-cash stock-based compensation), compared to $3.1 million (including $0.5 million of non-cash stock-based compensation) in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $3.7 million (including $1.0 million of non-cash stock-based compensation) in 2017. The sequential increase in selling, general and administrative expenses related primarily to higher payroll taxes, stock-based compensation and training expenses.\nDrilling Operations Update\nAll 14 of the Company's ShaleDrillerÂ® rigs are contracted and operating under term contracts.\nThe Company's March 31, 2018 backlog of revenues from contracts, with original terms of six months or more, was $52.7 million. Approximately 84% of this backlog is expected to be realized during the remainder of 2018.\nCapital Expenditures and Liquidity Update\nAggregate cash outlays for capital expenditures in 2018, net of disposals, were $6.1 million, including $5.3 million of payments for fourth quarter 2017 deliveries. The Company's aggregate capital expenditure budget for 2018 is $22 million, including $10 million associated with the completion of one additional newbuild rig.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had drawn $53.2 million on its $85.0 million credit facility and had net debt, excluding capital leases, of $50.7 million. The borrowing base under the Company's credit facility was $102.6 million as of March 31, 2018.\nConference Call Details\nA conference call for investors will be held today, April 26, 2018, at 11:00 a.m. Central Time (12:00 p.m. Eastern Time) to discuss the Company's first quarter 2018 results.

This information contains non-GAAP financial measures of the Company's operating performance. The Company believes this non-GAAP information is useful because it provides a means to evaluate the operating performance of the Company on an ongoing basis using criteria that are used by our management. Additionally, it highlights operating trends and aids analytical comparisons. However, this information has limitations and should not be used as an alternative to operating income (loss) or cash flow performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP, as this information excludes certain costs that may affect the Company's operating performance in future periods.\nOTHER FINANCIAL & OPERATING DATA\nUnaudited\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2017\nNumber of completed rigs end of period\n14\n14\n14\nRig operating days (1)\n1,259.4\n1,072.9\n1,288.6\nAverage number of operating rigs (2)\n14.0\n11.9\n14.0\nRig utilization (3)\n100.0%\n91.7%\n100.0%\nAverage revenue per operating day (4)\n$ 19,055\n$ 17,949\n$ 18,338\nAverage cost per operating day (5)\n$ 13,414\n$ 11,930\n$ 13,094\nAverage rig margin per operating day\n$ 5,641\n$ 6,019\n$ 5,244\n(1)\nRig operating days represent the number of days our rigs are earning revenue under a contract during the period, including days that standby revenues are earned. During the three months ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 we did not earn any revenue on a standby basis. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, there were 77.9 operating days in which we earned revenue on a standby basis, including 69.0 standby-without-crew days.\n(2)\nAverage number of operating rigs is calculated by dividing the total number of rig operating days in the period by the total number of calendar days in the period.\n(3)\nRig utilization is calculated as rig operating days divided by the total number of days our drilling rigs are available during the applicable period.\n(4)\nAverage revenue per operating day represents total contract drilling revenues earned during the period divided by rig operating days in the period. Excluded in calculating average revenue per operating day are revenues associated with the reimbursement of out-of-pocket costs paid by customers of $1.6 million, $1.0 million and $1.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, and December 31, 2017, respectively.\n(5)\nAverage cost per operating day represents operating costs incurred during the period divided by rig operating days in the period. The following costs are excluded in calculating average cost per operating day: (i) out-of-pocket costs reimbursed by customers of $1.6 million, $1.0 million and $1.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, and December 31, 2017, respectively, (ii) new crew training costs of $25.0 thousand, $60.0 thousand and zero during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, and December 31, 2017, respectively, (iii) construction overhead costs expensed due to reduced rig construction activity of $0.4 million, $0.2 million and $0.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, and December 31, 2017, respectively, (iv) rig reactivation costs associated with the redeployment of previously stacked rigs, excluding new crew training costs (included in (ii) above), of $0.7 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and (v) out-of-pocket expenses of $0.1 million, net of insurance recoveries, incurred as a result of damage to one of our rig's mast during the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted net loss, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. In addition, adjusted EBITDA is consistent with how EBITDA is calculated under our credit facility for purposes of determining our compliance with various financial covenants. We define \"EBITDA\" as earnings (or loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, and we define \"adjusted EBITDA\" as EBITDA before stock-based compensation, non-cash asset impairments, gains or losses on disposition of assets, and other non-recurring items added back to, or subtracted from, net income for purposes of calculating EBITDA under our credit facility. Neither adjusted net loss, EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA is a measure of net income as determined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\").\nManagement believes adjusted net loss, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are useful because they allow our stockholders to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compliance with various financial covenants under our credit facility and compare the results of our operations from period to period and against our peers without regard to our financing methods or capital structure or non-recurring, non-cash transactions. We exclude the items listed above from net income (loss) in calculating adjusted net loss, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. None of adjusted net loss, EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA should be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss), the most closely comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from adjusted net loss, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's return on assets, cost of capital and tax structure. Our presentation of adjusted net loss, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computations of adjusted net loss, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nReconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted Net Loss:\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2017\nAmount\nPer Share\nAmount\nPer Share\nAmount\nPer Share\n(in thousands)\nNet loss\n$ (4,146)\n$(0.11)\n$(6,269)\n$(0.17)\n$(5,745)\n$(0.15)\nAdd back:\nAsset impairments, net (1)\n(35)\n-\n129\n0.01\n994\n0.03\n(Gain) loss on disposition of assets, net (2)\n(82)\n-\n828\n0.02\n104\n-\nAdjusted net loss\n$ (4,263)\n$(0.11)\n$(5,312)\n$(0.14)\n$(4,647)\n$(0.12)\nReconciliation of Net Loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2017\n(in thousands)\nNet loss\n$ (4,146)\n$ (6,269)\n$ (5,745)\nAdd back:\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\n(49)\n46\n177\nInterest expense\n943\n630\n895\nDepreciation and amortization\n6,591\n6,256\n6,724\nAsset impairments, net (1)\n(35)\n129\n994\nEBITDA\n3,304\n792\n3,045\n(Gain) loss on disposition of assets, net (2)\n(82)\n828\n104\nStock-based compensation\n644\n1,012\n528\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 3,866\n$ 2,632\n$ 3,677\n(1)\nIn 2018, we recorded a $208 thousand recovery of impairment expense as a result of the decision to hold and use certain buildings and property previously held for sale, offset by the impairment of certain buildings of $173 thousand. In 2017, we recorded a $0.1 million, or $0.01 per share, non-cash impairment representing the estimated damage to the mast of one of our rigs, net of insurance recoveries. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a $1.0 million, or $0.03 per share, non-cash impairment of certain held for sale assets.\n(2)\nIn 2017, we recorded a loss on disposition of assets of $0.8 million, or $0.02 per share, primarily due to non-cash disposal of equipment in connection with the upgrade to 7,500 psi mud systems.\nINVESTOR CONTACTS:\nIndependence Contract Drilling, Inc.\nE-mail inquiries to: Investor.relations@icdrilling.com\nPhone inquiries: (281) 598-1211\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/independence-contract-drilling-inc-reports-financial-results-for-the-first-quarter-ended-march-31-2018-300636830.html\nSOURCE Independence Contract Drilling, Inc.",
