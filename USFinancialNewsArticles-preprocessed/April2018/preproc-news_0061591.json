    "text": "BOSTON, April 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- American Well®, the leading U.S. telehealth provider, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Avizia, a leading player in acute care telehealth.\nThis acquisition will bring to American Well a comprehensive acute care capability, including the best in class hospital-based cart lineup and custom software workflows for more than forty clinical specialties, including telestroke and tele-behavioral health. The move will enhance options available to clients across American Well's diverse telehealth ecosystem, including health systems, health plans, consumer aggregators, and health care service innovators, enabling clients to choose one comprehensive single platform solution. This acquisition is scheduled to close in late Q2 subject to the attainment of certain conditions.\n\"American Well helps providers treat patients who are not in the room. We do that by effectively connecting the four key players in the ecosystem: consumers, providers, payers and innovators,\" said Ido Schoenberg, MD, Chairman and CEO at American Well. \"We share Avizia's passion and relentless commitment to enabling better care anywhere.

Superior software solutions coupled with purpose-built telehealth devices will support a range of hospital use cases, enabling health systems to streamline clinical workflows; manage records easily by integrating with leading EMRs; optimize physician availability and utilization; and deliver care beyond their typical geographic reach.\n\"Avizia has always sought to help providers be confident they're giving patients the best access to the best care, regardless of location,\" said Mike Baird, CEO of Avizia. \"As part of American Well, we can expand this vision. Together, we will offer a truly best-in-class, enterprise telehealth platform – for urgent care, chronic disease management, acute care, and post acute care.
