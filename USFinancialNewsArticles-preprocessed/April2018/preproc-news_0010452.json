    "text": "6 COMMENTS Good morning. It’s been such a busy news week that you’d be forgiven for forgetting that one of the most important antitrust cases of modern times is still rolling in the background. On Wednesday, Judge Leon, the federal judge presiding over the government’s legal challenge to AT&T’s proposed takeover of Time Warner, asked whether the merger’s alleged harms to rival pay-TV distributors could be mitigated through fair arbitration. His questions raised the prospect that he might stop short of blocking the deal outright if he considers it a threat to competition, and consider remedies instead. WSJ has more .\nYou’re Going to Need a Bigger Boat I’m going to need to break out the bullet points again as Facebook unloaded a *lot* of news on us Wednesday. Buckle up.\n50 million users isn’t bad. You know what’s bad? 87 million users. That’s how many people’s data Facebook said may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica , significantly more than first reported. (For its part, Cambridge Analytica released a statement saying it licensed data for 30 million individuals, not 87 million, and it “immediately deleted the raw data” when Facebook told the company it had been improperly obtained.”)\nMore alarming, perhaps, is that the company said “most people on Facebook” could have had their information scraped by “malicious actors” who used a feature that let people search for users’ profiles by using their phone numbers or email addresses. That function has now been disabled. (Business Insider has the rundown on the kind of information that was up for grabs .) Mark this in your calendars: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will testify before the Senate Commerce Committee and Senate Judiciary Committee on April 10. He’ll then appear before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on April 11. Mr. Zuckerberg had a dress rehearsal for those hearings on Wednesday afternoon, when he held a rare and frank Q&A session with reporters ( Transcript here .) The call was mea culpa city, with the Facebook CEO saying he made a “ huge mistake ” in not focusing more on the potential abuse of users’ personal information and being caught on the backfoot when issues came to light. Mr. Zuckerberg also said the “delete Facebook” movement had not had a “meaningful impact,” but nevertheless, “it’s not good” as it signals a lack of trust in the platform from some users. We also learned Mr. Zuckerberg is a “power user of the internet,” which is good to know.\nElsewhere on Wednesday, Facebook released the first significant update to its privacy disclosures since 2015 . Mr. Zuckerberg said the company is planning to make the same privacy controls and settings available across the world, not just in Europe , where the new General Data Protection Regulation is set to apply.\nAnd we’re done! Only joking, one more: The company announced it is significantly restricting developers’ access to user data across areas including events, pages, groups and the login function that allows users to login to third-party services using their Facebook information. WPP’s Tsunami As the investigation into allegations of personal misconduct by WPP Chief Executive Martin Sorrell continues, the ad giant had another big piece of news out on Wednesday. WPP settled a 2016 lawsuit brought by Erin Johnson , the chief communications officer of J.Walter Thompson, WSJ’s Alex Bruell and Suzanne Vranica first reported. Ms. Johnson’s suit alleged the creative agency’s then-chief executive, Gustavo Martinez, had engaged in a pattern of misconduct that amounted to gender discrimination and a violation of her civil rights. The suit was filed before the #MeToo movement gathered pace and you may recall that back then it sparked a wave of soul-searching on Madison Avenue about diversity and sexual-harassment in the industry. As for what happens next at WPP? Ms. Johnson has received a “substantial settlement,” WSJ reported, and has resigned from her role at the agency. Mr. Martinez, who left his post of CEO at JWT shortly after the suit was filed, will continue to work on assignments in Spain for WPP.\n—Sorrell Latest—\nWSJ’s Nick Kostov takes a look at how WPP’s investigation into Mr. Sorrell marks a rare and public attempt to scrutinize the advertising mogul . Investors have long criticized the board for going too easy on Mr. Sorrell—especially regarding his pay and the lack of a clear successor. But the decision to hire an outside law firm to investigate the advertising chief has broken the bonhomie, according to a person familiar with the relationship.\nSee You At the Bitter End As we’ve been relaying in this newsletter, merger talks between CBS and Viacom have been advancing. But now those talks are getting bitter as both sides are sticking to their guns in negotiations over price and who will lead the merged company, WSJ’s Joe Flint reports. The latest? Viacom rejected what it considered to be a lowball bid —CBS’s all-stock offer that was below Viacom’s current valuation—and it’s expected to make a counterproposal this week. As you’d imagine, Viacom wants a premium on its current stock price, and it also wants its CEO, Bob Bakish, to be No. 2 to CBS CEO Leslie Moonves (CBS wants its president, Joe Ianniello, to remain Mr. Moonves’s right-hand man.) Meanwhile, in the background, Shari Redstone, the president of National Amusements and vice chair of both companies, is growing frustrated at the long-winded process, not least because CBS’s proposal took her by surprise, according to a person familiar with her thinking. Expect this one to remain messy.\nBest of the rest NBCUniversal is introducing a new viewing metric called “CFlight” that will take into account impressions across live audiences, as well as people viewing on-demand on digital platforms. The total number will be comprised of data from third-party research companies including Nielsen, Moat, comScore, and platforms such as Hulu and Roku.
