    "text": "0 COMMENTS The White House said on Tuesday that Tom Bossert is leaving as homeland security and counterterrorism adviser, an abrupt departure that comes as President Donald Trump’s new national security adviser moves to establish power.\nMr. Bossert’s position was on the same level as that of John Bolton, who just began as national security adviser on Monday. His departure also came days after Michael Anton, a spokesman for the National Security Council, resigned, the White House said.\nIn his role, Mr. Bossert has overseen issues including the administration’s response to a hurricane that battered Puerto Rico , a massive cyberattack last year that the administration blamed on the North Korean government , and, more recently, a plan to deploy National Guard members to the U.S.-Mexico border .\nBefore joining the administration, Mr. Bossert worked as a private consultant on homeland-security matters and previously served in the George W. Bush administration as deputy homeland security adviser overseeing issues including cybersecurity.\nMr. Bossert came into the job with high praise from lawmakers from both parties. But after he took the job, current and former staffers at the National Security Council said he repeatedly clashed with former national security adviser Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, and they said Mr. Bossert failed to develop a cyberstrategy or a counterterrorism policy as planned.\nHis resignation was earlier reported by Bloomberg News.\nIn a statement, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Mr. Trump “is grateful for Tom’s commitment to the safety and security” of the U.S.\nMr. Bossert is the most recent in a series of staff or administration departures in recent weeks, including Gary Cohn as director of the National Economics Council, Gen. McMaster as national security adviser, Hope Hicks as White House communications director and David Shulkin as veterans affairs secretary .\nMr. Bossert’s departure is likely to empower Mr. Bolton, a hawkish former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and Fox News commentator. It wasn’t clear if Mr. Trump would replace Mr. Bossert.\nFor years, the White House homeland security adviser had a staff separate from the national-security team, but President Barack Obama united those groups.\nIn the White House, Mr. Bossert had sought to establish himself as a power center to rival the national security adviser. One person familiar with the move said Mr. Bossert’s departure was a sign that Mr. Bolton was quickly moving to consolidate power.\n“This is an assertion of the primacy of the national security adviser,” the person said.\nWrite to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com and Dion Nissenbaum at dion.nissenbaum@wsj.com",
