    "text": "HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Weingarten Realty (NYSE: WRI) announced today the results of its operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. The supplemental financial package with additional information can be found on the Company's website under the Investor Relations tab.\nFirst Quarter Operating and Financial Highlights\nNet income attributable to common shareholders (“Net Income”) for the quarter was $1.13 per diluted share (hereinafter “per share”) compared to $0.24 per share in the same quarter of 2017; Core Funds From Operations Attributable to Common Shareholders (\"Core FFO\") for the quarter was $0.57 per share compared to $0.61 per share a year ago; Same Property Net Operating Income (“SPNOI”) including redevelopments increased 2.0% over the same quarter of the prior year; Occupancy increased to 94.8% from 93.7% at the end of the first quarter of 2017; Dispositions for the quarter totaled $268 million; and Common shares totaling $13.9 million and unsecured debt totaling $14.3 million were repurchased to-date in 2018.\nFinancial Results\nThe Company reported Net Income of $146.8 million or $1.13 per share for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $30.8 million or $0.24 per share for the same period in 2017. This significant increase was due primarily to higher gains on sales of properties during 2018.\nFunds From Operations attributable to common shareholders in accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts definition (“NAREIT FFO”) was $78.3 million or $0.60 per share for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $74.4 million or $0.57 per share for 2017. The increase is primarily due to increased occupancy, increased rental rates and incremental income from our new developments and redevelopments. Also contributing to the increase in NAREIT FFO was reduced interest expense due to the reduction of debt outstanding with disposition proceeds from 2017 and 2018; however, these increases were offset by the reduced operating income from these same property dispositions in both years. Additionally, NAREIT FFO for 2018 included about $0.03 per share of gain on debt extinguishment in the quarter. In 2017, NAREIT FFO included $.04 per share for a lease termination payment and impairments of non-operating property, net of the related tax benefit. Core FFO is calculated by deducting from NAREIT FFO the gain on debt extinguishment in 2018 and adding back a lease termination payment and impairments in 2017. Core FFO for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $74.7 million or $0.57 per share compared to $79.5 million or $0.61 per share for the same quarter of last year.\nEffective this quarter, the Company adopted the new revenue recognition standard, ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, which resulted in the classification of about $1.1 million of revenue from parking, licensing and occupancy agreements out of Rental Revenue into Other Revenue. As this standard was adopted on a modified retrospective approach, we did not restate the prior year amounts. The detail of the classification adjustments by line item is included on Page 45 of the Supplemental and this impact was adjusted for on Same Property NOI by line item on Page 30.\nReconciliations of Net Income to NAREIT FFO and Core FFO are included herein.\nOperating Results\nFor the period ending March 31, 2018, the Company’s operating highlights were as follows:\nQ1 2018\nOccupancy (Signed Basis): Occupancy - Total 94.8% Occupancy - Small Shop Spaces 90.4% Occupancy - Same Property Portfolio 95.4% Same Property Net Operating Income, with redevelopments 2.0% Rental Rate Growth - Total: 5.8% New Leases 4.9% Renewals 5.9% Leasing Transactions: Number of New Leases 75 New Leases - Annualized Revenue (in millions) $5.3 Number of Renewals 169 Renewals - Annualized Revenue (in millions) $14.9 A reconciliation of Net Income to SPNOI is included herein.\n“We are pleased with our performance as we continue to add quality merchants to our outstanding portfolio of properties. Our occupancy continues to improve, increasing 1.1% over last year to 94.8%. Additionally, as 2.8% of our portfolio has signed leases that have not commenced, we have imbedded growth for the remainder of 2018 which should contribute to meeting our Same Property NOI guidance for the year ,” said Johnny Hendrix, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.\nPortfolio Activity\nDuring the quarter, the Company closed $268 million of dispositions with the sale of eight shopping centers including Moore Plaza in Corpus Christi, Texas, Best in the West and Paradise Marketplace in Las Vegas, Nevada, Millpond Center and Tates Creek Centre in Lexington, Kentucky, Horne Street Market in Fort Worth, Texas, Palmilla Center in Avondale, Arizona and a portion of Stoneridge Towne Centre in Moreno Valley, California. The Company also sold two land parcels.\nAs for acquisitions, the Company purchased a land parcel adjacent to an existing shopping center for $1.3 million during the quarter and will begin construction of a 9,000 square foot multi-tenant building in the next 30 days.\nThe Company invested $27 million in new developments and redevelopments during the first quarter. Groundbreaking on the Driscoll at River Oaks, a 30-story residential tower to be constructed at the Company’s River Oaks Shopping Center, is expected to occur this summer.\n“We are pleased with our solid start to 2018 considering the retail real estate environment. Further, our dispositions reduce our exposure to power centers and to tertiary markets which clearly enhances the overall quality of our portfolio. Our new developments and redevelopments are progressing nicely, which will provide earnings growth going forward,” said Drew Alexander, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nBalance Sheet\nProceeds for the Company’s 2017 and 2018 dispositions were used to further enhance its balance sheet. The Company paid down its $200 million term loan in two $100 million tranches, the second of which closed on April 3rd. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company repurchased $13.7 million of its unsecured bonds and $8.1 million of its common shares at an average price of $27.37 per share. Subsequent to quarter-end, the Company repurchased an additional $0.6 million of its unsecured bonds and $5.8 million of its common shares at an average price of $26.89. At quarter-end, Net Debt to Core EBITDAre was a strong 5.1 times and Debt to Total Market Capitalization was 34.6%.\n“With the strongest credit metrics we have had in many years, we are poised to take advantage of whatever opportunities may arise, which could include quality acquisitions, additional purchases of our bonds and buying back our stock. Low leverage provides the flexibility to react quickly as market conditions change,” said Steve Richter, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\n2018 Guidance\nAs to earnings guidance, we are increasing NAREIT FFO per share to a range of $2.29 to $2.35 and reaffirm Core FFO for the year along with the supporting details as previously provided. All of the details of our guidance are included on page 10 of our Supplemental.\nDividends\nThe Board of Trust Managers declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.395 per common share payable on June 15, 2018 to shareholders of record on June 8, 2018.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company also announced that it will host a live webcast of its quarterly conference call on April 25, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Central Time. The live webcast can be accessed via the Company’s website at www.weingarten.com .

Management uses these measures along with our Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") financial statements in order to evaluate our operating results. Management believes these additional measures provide users of our financial information additional comparable indicators of our industry, as well as, our performance.\nFunds from Operations Attributable to Common Shareholders\nThe National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\") defines NAREIT FFO as net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items and gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets and interests in real estate equity investments and their applicable taxes, plus depreciation and amortization of operating properties and impairment of depreciable real estate and in substance real estate equity investments, including our share of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships. The Company calculates NAREIT FFO in a manner consistent with the NAREIT definition.\nManagement believes NAREIT FFO is a widely recognized measure of REIT operating performance which provides our shareholders with a relevant basis for comparison among other REITs. Management uses NAREIT FFO as a supplemental internal measure to conduct and evaluate our business because there are certain limitations associated with using GAAP net income by itself as the primary measure of our operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, management believes that the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that uses historical cost accounting is insufficient by itself. There can be no assurance that NAREIT FFO presented by the Company is comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs.\nThe Company also presents Core FFO as an additional supplemental measure as it is more reflective of the core operating performance of our portfolio of properties. Core FFO is defined as NAREIT FFO excluding charges and gains related to non-cash, non-operating and other transactions or events that hinder the comparability of operating results. Specific examples of items excluded from Core FFO include, but are not limited to, gains or losses associated with the extinguishment of debt or other liabilities, impairments of land, transactional costs associated with acquisition and development activities, certain deferred tax provisions/benefits, redemption costs of preferred shares and gains on the disposal of non-real estate assets. NAREIT FFO and Core FFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income or other measurements under GAAP as indicators of operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as measures of liquidity. NAREIT FFO and Core FFO do not reflect working capital changes, cash expenditures for capital improvements or principal payments on indebtedness.\nNAREIT FFO and Core FFO is calculated as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018 2017 (Unaudited) Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 146,824 $ 30,826 Depreciation and amortization of real estate 37,765 42,188 Depreciation and amortization of real estate of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures\nand partnerships\n3,184 3,639 Impairment of operating properties and real estate equity investments — 12,005 (Gain) on sale of property and interests in real estate equity investments (109,038 ) (15,748 ) (Gain) on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships (2,363 ) — Provision (benefit) for income taxes (1) 161 (2,392 ) Noncontrolling interests and other (2) 1,210 3,369 NAREIT FFO – basic 77,743 73,887 Income attributable to operating partnership units 528 526 NAREIT FFO – diluted 78,271 74,413 Adjustments to Core FFO: Other impairment loss — 3,017 Provision (benefit) for income taxes — (952 ) (Gain) on extinguishment of debt including related swap activity (3,557 ) — Other — 3,066 Core FFO – diluted $ 74,714 $ 79,544 FFO weighted average shares outstanding – basic 127,926 127,610 Effect of dilutive securities: Share options and awards 781 938 Operating partnership units 1,432 1,462 FFO weighted average shares outstanding – diluted 130,139 130,010 NAREIT FFO per common share – basic $ .61 $ .58 NAREIT FFO per common share – diluted $ .60 $ .57 Core FFO per common share – diluted $ .57 $ .61 (1) The applicable taxes related to gains and impairments of operating properties. (2) Related to gains, impairments and depreciation on operating properties and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, where applicable. Same Property Net Operating Income\nManagement considers SPNOI an important additional financial measure because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level and when compared across periods, reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. The Company calculates this most useful measurement by determining our proportional share of SPNOI from all owned properties, including the Company’s share of SPNOI from unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships, which cannot be readily determined under GAAP measurements and presentation. Although SPNOI (see page 1 of the supplemental disclosure regarding this presentation and limitations thereof) is a widely used measure among REITs, there can be no assurance that SPNOI presented by the Company is comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs. Additionally, the Company does not control these unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships, and the assets, liabilities, revenues or expenses of these joint ventures and partnerships, as presented, do not represent its legal claim to such items.\nProperties are included in the SPNOI calculation if they are owned and operated for the entirety of the most recent two fiscal year periods, except for properties for which significant redevelopment or expansion occurred during either of the periods presented, and properties that have been sold. While there is judgment surrounding changes in designations, management moves new development and redevelopment properties once they have stabilized, which is typically upon attainment of 90% occupancy. A rollforward of the properties included in the Company’s same property designation is as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 Beginning of the period 183 Properties added: Acquisitions 6 New Developments 1 Redevelopments 2 Properties removed: Dispositions (8) End of the period 184 The Company calculates SPNOI using operating income as defined by GAAP excluding property management fees, certain non-cash revenues and expenses such as straight-line rental revenue and the related reversal of such amounts upon early lease termination, depreciation, amortization, impairment losses, general and administrative expenses, acquisition costs and other items such as lease cancellation income, environmental abatement costs, demolition expenses and lease termination fees. Consistent with the capital treatment of such costs under GAAP, tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other direct leasing costs are excluded from SPNOI. A reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders to SPNOI is as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 (Unaudited) Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 146,824 $ 30,826 Add: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 2,145 5,570 Provision (benefit) for income taxes 783 (3,359 ) Interest expense, net 14,672 21,082 Less: Gain on sale of property (109,045 ) (15,763 ) Equity in earnings of real estate joint ventures and partnership interests (5,993 ) (5,317 ) Interest and other income/expense (1,533 ) (1,622 ) Operating Income 47,853 31,417 Less: Revenue adjustments (1) (3,932 ) (4,109 ) Add: Property management fees 867 926 Depreciation and amortization 38,095 42,449 Impairment loss — 14,986 General and administrative 5,595 7,384 Acquisition costs — 1 Other (2) 89 3,117 Net Operating Income 88,567 96,171 Less: NOI related to consolidated entities not defined as same property and noncontrolling interests (3,892 ) (13,643 ) Add: Pro rata share of unconsolidated entities defined as same property 8,374 8,687 Same Property Net Operating Income 93,049 91,215 Less: Redevelopment Net Operating Income (7,133 ) (6,693 ) Same Property Net Operating Income excluding Redevelopments $ 85,916 $ 84,522",
