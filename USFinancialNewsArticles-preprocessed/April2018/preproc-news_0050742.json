    "text": "April 25 (Reuters) - Britain’s TSB Bank, owned by Spain’s Banco Sabadell, said its mobile banking application and online banking were up and running after resolving a slew of glitches with its digital services.\nTSB, which has apologised after some customers were unable to access their accounts online, said on Tuesday it needed to take its mobile application and online banking down for a “few hours” after working for 48 hours to fix the problems.\n“Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us,” CEO Paul Pester said on Twitter.\nRoyal Bank of Scotland’s Irish unit also reported an issue that led to salaries going missing from some accounts on Tuesday.\nReporting by Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru, editing by Sinead Cruise\n ",
