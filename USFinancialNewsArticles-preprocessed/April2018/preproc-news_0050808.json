    "text": "NORTH LIBERTY, Iowa, Heartland Express, Inc. (Nasdaq:HTLD) announced today financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nThree months ended March 31, 2018:\nNet Income of $13.4 million, Basic Earnings per Share of $0.16, Operating Revenue of $156.7 million a year-over-year increase of 20.6%, Operating Ratio of 91.7% and 90.4% Non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Ratio (1) , Cash balance of $105 million, a $29.6 million increase from December 31, 2017, Debt-Free Balance Sheet, Total Stockholders' Equity of $585.1 million and Total Assets of $823.2 million.\nHeartland Express Chief Executive Officer Michael Gerdin, commented on the quarterly operating results and ongoing initiatives of the Company, \"I am excited to report our results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 which are our strongest operating results delivered to date since our acquisition of Interstate Distributor Co. We delivered our lowest quarterly operating ratio (91.7% and 90.4% non-GAAP adjusted operating ratio (1) ) as compared to the last two quarters following the acquisition on July 6, 2017. Further, the month of March was our strongest month of the quarter where we delivered the lowest operating ratio in any single month since the acquisition. Our overall earnings for the first quarter include the favorable tax impacts related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (approximately $0.02 per share). We have also been diligently working on eliminating or lowering unnecessary or unproductive costs following the acquisition and we anticipate continuing to do so in the months ahead. We expect in the coming quarters, additional operational improvements and progress towards our goal of returning to an operating ratio in the low-80's. Heartland remains committed to on-time and just-in-time service for our loyal customers.\"\nFinancial Results\nHeartland Express ended the first quarter of 2018 with net income of $13.4 million, compared to $14.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Basic earnings per share were $0.16 during the quarter compared to $0.17 earnings per share in the first quarter of 2017. Operating revenues were $156.7 million, compared to $129.9 million in the first quarter of 2017, a 20.6% increase. Operating revenues for the quarter included fuel surcharge revenues of $21.5 million compared to $14.9 million in the same period of 2017, a $6.6 million increase. Operating revenues increased 17.5%, excluding the impact of fuel surcharge revenues (1) , primarily due to higher miles driven following the Interstate Distributor Co. (\"IDC\") acquisition during the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017. Operating income for the three-month period decreased $6.4 million primarily due to lower gains on sale of equipment combined with the negative operating impacts from the consolidation of IDC financial results when compared to the prior period. The Company posted an operating ratio of 91.7%, adjusted operating ratio (1) of 90.4%, and an 8.5% net margin (net income as a percentage of operating revenues) in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 85.1%, 83.2%, and 10.8%, respectively in the first quarter of 2017.\nBalance Sheet, Liquidity, and Capital Expenditures\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had $105.0 million in cash balances and no borrowings under the Company's unsecured line of credit. The Company had $171.3 million in available borrowing capacity on the line of credit at March 31, 2018 after consideration of $3.7 million outstanding letters of credit. The Company continues to be in compliance with associated financial covenants. The Company ended the quarter with total assets of $823.2 million and stockholders' equity of $585.1 million.\nNet cash flows from operations for the first three months of 2018 were $32.2 million, 20.6% of operating revenue. The primary use of net cash generated from operations during the three month period ended March 31, 2018 was $5.9 million for net equipment transactions, $1.7 million for dividends, and $1.3 million for the repurchase of our common stock. The average age of the Company's tractor fleet was 1.5 years as of March 31, 2018 compared to 1.8 years at March 31, 2017. The average age of the Company's trailer fleet was 4.9 years at March 31, 2018 compared to 4.5 years at March 31, 2017. The Company currently anticipates a total of approximately $85 to $95 million in net capital expenditures for calendar year 2018. The Company ended the past twelve months with a return on total assets of 9.4% and a 13.4% return on equity.\nThe Company continues its commitment to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and repurchases of common stock.
