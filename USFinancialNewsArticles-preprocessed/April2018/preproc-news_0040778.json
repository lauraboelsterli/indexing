    "text": "Russia: Trump promised to make a reciprocal visit to Moscow Published 4 Hours Ago The Associated Press BPA | Getty Images In this photo provided by the German Government Press Office (BPA), Donald Trump meets Vladimir Putin during the G20 Summit on July 7, 2017 in Hamburg, Germany. \nRussia's foreign minister says U.S. President Donald Trump indicated he could make a reciprocal trip to Russia if President Vladimir Putin were able to accept his invitation to the White House . \nSergey Lavrov told Russian state television Friday that Trump mentioned the possibility of travelling to Russia when he called Putin on March 20 to congratulate him on his re-election. \nBoth the White House and the Kremlin previously revealed that Trump had invited Putin to the White House during the same call, when the two leaders discussed wanting to meet soon. \nLavrov says the Trump administration hasn't followed up on Trump's offer. \nLavrov said Russia has urged the U.S. to discuss specifics about such a meeting. He says Russian officials \"don't want to be too obtrusive, but don't want to be impolite.\" ",
