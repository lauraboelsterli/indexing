    "text": "Tyler Anderson pitched six strong innings and had a key at-bat in Colorado’s fifth inning, and the Rockies beat the visiting Chicago Cubs 5-2 on Saturday night.\nNolan Arenado had two hits and Gerardo Parra drove in a pair of runs for Colorado, which prevailed in the cold weather.\nAlbert Almora Jr. followed Friday’s four-hit night with two more for Chicago, and Willson Contreras had two RBIs.\nAnderson (1-0) got his first win in five starts this season after settling down following a rough beginning. Wade Davis got the last three outs for his ninth save in 10 opportunities.\nThe Cubs scored two runs in the top of the first for the second straight game. Almora led off with a bloop single to center, Javier Baez followed with a single and Contreras drove them in with a two-out double that just missed being a home run.\nYu Darvish (0-2) didn’t allow a hit until Arenado’s two-out single in the fourth but then the Rockies hit him hard in the fifth.\nA two-out walk to Anderson put runners on first and second, and DJ LeMahieu hit a ground-rule double to drive in the first run. Parra singled up the middle to score two more. After a walk to Charlie Blackmon, Arenado singled home another run, and Trevor Story had an RBI double to make it 5-2.\nBrian Duensing relieved Darvish and got the last out of the fifth. Darvish finished with five runs allowed on five hits and four walks in 4 2/3 innings.\nThe weather was cold for the second straight game, but the rain that fell Friday had stopped by first pitch. It was 41 degrees at first pitch and dropped to 35 degrees by game’s end.\nSaturday was the major league debut of Colorado native and Cubs rookie David Bote. Bote was recalled from Triple-A Iowa after Ben Zobrist was placed on the 10-day disabled list with back tightness. Bote, who grew up in Longmont, approximately 28 miles from Coors Field, doubled in his first at-bat and went 1-for-3.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
