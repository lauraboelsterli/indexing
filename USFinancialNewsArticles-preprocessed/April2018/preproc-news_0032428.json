    "text": "TOKYO, April 17 (Reuters) - Japanâ€™s Nikkei ended little changed on Tuesday as investors turned cautious ahead of a meeting between Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. President Donald Trump which Tokyo fears may link vital security matters with touchy trade issues.\nThe Nikkei share average ended up 0.1 percent at 21,847.59 after trading in negative territory for most of the session. The broader Topix fell 0.4 percent to 1,729.98, with 27 of its 33 sub-sectors falling.\nShares of food companies gained, with NH Foods rising 1.6 percent and Ajinomoto up 0.9 percent.\nFinancial stocks underperformed, with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group falling 1.0 percent and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group shedding 1.3 percent. Nomura Holdings lost 0.9 percent while MS&AD Insurance declined 1.5 percent.\nTakeda Pharmaceutical Co soared 2.0 percent after Shire, which faces a potential bid from Takeda, said it would sell its oncology business to unlisted French drugmaker Servier for $2.4 billion.
