    "text": "GLENDALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Americas United Bank (OTC Pink: AUNB) today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2018, with quarterly earnings of $471,994, or $0.16 per basic share and $0.15 per diluted share. Total assets at the period-end were $229.1 million, and the Bank’s equity capital was $29.7 million.\n“We are pleased to report that we achieved another profitable quarter and have continued to operate in prudent and sound manner and this has contributed to our continued success. We were also profitable while having incurred merger related expenses as a result of our announced merger with the Bank of Southern California that is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018,” said Adriana M. Boeka, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights:\nNet income increased 41.5% to $471,994 in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $333,625 in the first quarter of 2017. Net interest margin was 3.55% in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to 3.40% in the first quarter of 2017. Credit quality remains strong. The loan portfolio decreased 0.15% or $309,000 to $201.9 million in the first quarter of 2018, when compared to the first quarter 2017 of $202.2 million. Book value per share increased to $10.15 per share compared to $9.53 a year ago. Tangible book value per share increased to $10.01 per share.\nNo provision for loan losses was taken in the quarter as a result of the reserve being at the appropriate level and there being zero non-performing assets. The allowance for loan losses totaled $2.2 million at March 31, 2018, or 1.10% of total loans.\nTotal assets were $229.1 million at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $4.4 million, or 1.9% from $233.5 million at March 31, 2017\nTotal deposits were $198.4 million, at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 1.4% from $201.3 million at March 31, 2017. Core deposits defined as noninterest bearing demand, money market, NOW, and savings accounts decreased 7.1% to $124.9 million from $134.5 million a year earlier at March 31, 2017.\nShareholder equity increased to $29.7 million at March 31, 2018, from $27.4 million at March 31, 2017.\nPresident and CEO Boeka said, “Our deposit levels dipped in the first quarter from our customers using their funds as the strong economy has spurred use of available funds. Our balance sheet remains strong and is comprised of good quality earning assets that allows for steady and progressive earnings growth. We continue to seek additional opportunities to enhance shareholder value and we are looking forward to the consummation of our merger with the Bank of Southern California that was announced earlier in 2018.”\nThe bank’s capital ratios exceeded the regulatory guidelines for a well-capitalized financial institution under the Basel III and Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform requirements at March 31, 2018. The Bank reported the following capital ratios at March 31, 2018:\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio 14.07% Tier 1 Leverage Ratio 12.61% Tier 1 Capital Ratio 14.07% Total Capital Ratio 15.16% About Americas United Bank\nAmericas United Bank provides a full range of financial services, including credit and deposit products, cash management, and internet banking for businesses and high net worth individuals from its head office at 801 N.
