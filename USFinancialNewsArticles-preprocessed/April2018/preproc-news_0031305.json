    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, April 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (from booth #423 at RSA Conference 2018) – FireMon , the leader in network security policy management, today announced FireMon Global Policy Controller™ (GPC), a new product that enables frictionless security infrastructure management for the hybrid enterprise. FireMon GPC brings together DevOps and other business stakeholders with security managers in a consistent, parallel operating model that improves security and agility while reducing costs. The result is a policy orchestration platform that delivers efficient, compliant security configurations in seconds, global visibility and management of network posture, and continuous security control for traditional and virtual platforms.\nAs enterprises navigate major technology shifts in their computing environments, management of network security across traditional infrastructure, cloud resources and containers has become so complex that delays, outages and security lapses are common and costly. FireMon GPC solves this problem by enabling application owners and line-of-business leaders to directly define and manage their intent for access while, in parallel, allowing security teams to enforce secure templates that govern the access that gets created. This frictionless operating model supports the transition to cloud-native and container-first environments with consistent automation and DevOps practices, including the enablement of new security architectures such as Zero Trust and microsegmentation.\n“Fifty-seven percent of respondents plan to merge responsibilities for teams responsible for on-premises and public-cloud resident portions of their hybrid cloud infrastructure,” said Doug Cahill, senior analyst, Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG), referencing research results from ESG’s report Trends in Hybrid Cloud Security: Minding the Gap . “Hybrid cloud security is a team sport. For FireMon, orchestration helps enterprises deploy hybrid cloud security controls and bridge the gap between security and DevOps teams.”\nFireMon GPC eliminates deviations from policy compliance through its patent-pending Policy Compute Engine, which provides the following capabilities:\nDynamic policy change: Instantly adapting to network changes, FireMon GPC creates a continuous state of security across all IT assets in any environment, at all times. Embedded security: Before any applications or assets are pushed onto the network, FireMon GPC automatically performs a compliance check to ensure the right policies are assigned. By enforcing policy “guardrails,” FireMon GPC ensures continuous security on a global scale. Intent translation: FireMon GPC automatically translates business intent into specific security rules, with no human intervention. This enables new applications to deploy in seconds rather than hours or even days, while eliminating human error. Automated distribution: By automatically distributing the right rules to any enforcement point, FireMon GPC provides DevOps and other application owners with guided “self-serve” security capabilities. This eliminates the delays caused by traditional manual rules creation and provisioning.\n“FireMon invented the network security policy management market two decades ago, and with the Global Policy Controller, we are leading its evolution into next-generation hybrid IT infrastructures,” said FireMon CEO Satin Mirchandani. “FireMon GPC is the first of its kind – a solution that automatically ensures real-time compliance with enterprise security intent, across any IT asset, in any computing environment. This means enterprises can move as fast as they need to without introducing new security risk. In today’s dynamic and complex business environment, persistent security that moves at the speed of business is a powerful value proposition.”\nAbout FireMon\nThe FireMon platform delivers continuous security for hybrid enterprises through a powerful fusion of vulnerability management, continuous compliance and orchestration. Since creating the first-ever network security management solution 15 years ago, FireMon solutions have continued to deliver visibility into and control over complex network security infrastructure, policies and risk for more than 1,500 customers around the world.
