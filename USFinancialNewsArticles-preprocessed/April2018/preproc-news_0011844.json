So the ability of the equity markets to push significantly lower is going to be limited,\" said John Brady, senior vice president at R.J. O'Brien & Associates in Chicago.\n\"We're going to need brand new, bad news on trade for the equity markets to push lower.\"\nFacebook, Amazon, Alphabet and Netflix - collectively known as the \"FANG\" group - were up between 1.2 percent and 2.6 percent.\nAt 12:02 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.46 percent at 24,617.39. The S&P 500 gained 1.03 percent to 2,671.85 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.92 percent to 7,106.54.\nIf current gains for S&P 500 hold, it would be the best three-day run since Trump's election victory in November 2016.\nNine of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by a 1.2 percent gain on the material and the energy indexes.\nThe S&P 500 index showed four new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 47 new highs and 24 new lows.\nFacebook shares gained after Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the company had not seen \"any meaningful impact\" on usage or ad sales since the data privacy scandal.\n\"Zuckerberg is going to testify the Congress next week on the Facebook issues, so probably there's some bargain hunting in FANG space,\" said Brady.\nOn Wednesday, the Dow bounced back from a 500 point fall earlier to close up about 230 points after President Donald Trump's top economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the administration was involved in a \"negotiation\" with China rather than a trade war.\nEconomic data on Thursday showed the U.S. trade deficit increased to a near 9-1/2-year high in February, but the shortfall with China narrowed sharply. While exports to China were unchanged in February, imports from the country declined 14.7 percent.\nAdvanced Micro Devices jumped 3.2 percent after Stifel upgraded to \"buy\", while Micron Technology fell 5.3 percent after UBS started with a \"sell\" rating.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE for a 2.76-to-1 ratio and on the Nasdaq for a 1.90-to-1 ratio.
