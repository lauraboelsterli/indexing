Soccer Football - Champions League Quarter Final Second Leg - Manchester City vs Liverpool - Etihad Stadium, Manchester, Britain - April 10, 2018 Manchester City's Kevin De Bruyne reacts after conceding their second goal scored by Liverpool's Roberto Firmino REUTERS/Darren Staples \nAfter a trophyless debut season in England, manager Pep Guardiola oversaw the exits of several older players and brought in younger replacements. \nCity, who have 11 players below the age of 25 in their current squad, have been rampant this season, winning 28 of their 33 league matches to seal the title and add to February’s League Cup triumph. \n\"It's no coincidence that the type of players brought in over the last year or two have all been of a similar age and we will look to build as a group together,\" De Bruyne,26, told City's website. www.mancity.com \n“The feeling amongst the squad is great. We have enjoyed the season a lot but there is work to do if we want to achieve more in future. \n“That can be the trickiest thing in football, to not only win but keep winning. Having such a young squad will hopefully help us to achieve that.” \nCity have scored 93 league goals so far and could still surpass Chelsea’s record tally of 103 goals in a single campaign. \nThe champions host 17th-placed Swansea City in the league on Sunday.
