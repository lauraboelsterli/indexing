Subscribe to WSJ Pro Cybersecurity for in-depth coverage on cybersecurity trends, breaches and best practices. Good morning, CIOs. Companies are working hard to figure out how to extract value from artificial intelligence (more on that below). Some promising early efforts can be found in sales, an activity that generates lots of usable data that lends itself to analysis.\nThe sales team at Snowflake Computing Inc. employs an automated, AI-powered chatbot designed to engage with potential buyers by email or text. Each assistant, developed by Conversica , speaks six languages and works around the clock engaging with prospects and turning over the most advanced leads to humans, CIO Journal’s Angus Loten reports . Collective (i) use AI to help sales managers assess the odds a deal will produce results .\nThe use of AI and sales is ramping up. Gartner Inc. estimates that 30% of all business-to-business companies world-wide will employ some form of AI in at least one of their primary sales processes by 2020.\nMachine learning at scale remains elusive for many firms. For all the talk of machine learning and AI’s potential in the enterprise, many firms aren’t yet equipped to take advantage of it fully, panelists said Friday at the MIT Digital Economy Conference. Few companies have deployed these technologies in a core business process or at scale, said panelist Michael Chui, a partner at McKinsey Global Institute. “We’re very early.”\nBuilding a framework for the safe management of digital identities and data. In a world that’s increasingly governed by digital transactions and data, our existing methods for managing security and privacy are proving inadequate. What’s needed is the ability to share information in a privacy-preserving manner, says CIO Journal Columnist Irving Wladawsky-Berger .\nSECURITY\nGiant letters, reading the word “blockchain”, are displayed at the blockchain centre, in Lithuania’s capital Vilnius. Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Blockchain will be theirs. Technologists who attended a meeting in Tokyo to discuss blockchain standards tell the New York Times they were surprised by comments made by the head of the Russian delegation, a former intelligence agent, who said that while the internet belonged to the U.S., blockchain would be Russia’s. Says the NYT: “The Russian interest in the normally wonky technical sessions has caused concern among other delegations, who worry that individual countries could push standards that would make the security of the blockchain technology vulnerable to surveillance and attack.”\nEnergy cyber spending questioned. Security consultants Precision Analytics LLC and The CAP Group LLCnergy say energy companies are spending less than 0.2 percent of their revenue on cybersecurity. Bloomberg reports that the figure is at least a third less than financial institutions. An attack last month that shut down several pipeline operators in North America underscores the threat.\nU.K. pols grok Facebook more than U.S. pols. That was evident in the more than four hours of questioning Facebook chief technology officer Mike Schroepfer faced from a British parliamentary committee over the company’s data-collection techniques. The New York Times reports that the session had “little of the rancor and political speechifying that takes over high-profile American hearings.”\nEMERGING TECHNOLOGY\nPeople are needed to oversee the work of machines to make sure they’re doing their jobs properly. R. KIKUO JOHNSON FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Digital assistants start to get more human. Bot makers are trying to move beyond such scripting by employing artificial-intelligence techniques including deep learning. But coaxing a computer to converse meaningfully as context builds and shifts is extraordinarily difficult. “It’s harder than image recognition, speech recognition, self-driving cars—much harder than all these amazing things,” Tom Hebner leader of the cognitive innovation group at Nuance Communications, tells the WSJ’s Ted Greenwald .\nSeven jobs robots will create—or expand. Yes, jobs will be lost as artificial intelligence takes on more tasks , and many people will be forced to learn new skills to keep up in this new environment. But experts say the picture has a surprisingly big silver lining. The WSJ’s Daniela Hernandez identifies seven jobs–from AI builder to data labeler to drone performance artist–that will be created—or transformed—by these new smart technologies.\nPreparing the kids. Journal contributor Alexandra Samuel has several suggestions for preparing children for their AI future, including teaching them to code, fostering creativity through arts education and nurturing emotional intelligence.\nShould the government regulate AI? “One of the ironies of artificial intelligence is that proponents often make two contradictory claims. They say artificial intelligence is going to change everything, but there should be no changes to law or legal institutions in response,” Ryan Calo, an associate law professor at the University of Washington and a co-director of the school’s Tech Policy Lab, tells the Journal’s Heidi Vogt . “The question is not whether there should be regulation but how can regulation best channel AI toward its ultimate goal of promoting human flourishing.”\nMORE TECHNOLOGY NEWS\nThe relatively high pay at Google parent Alphabet and at Facebook is a sign of the talent war in Silicon Valley. MICHAEL SHORT/BLOOMBERG NEWS At Alphabet, median pay nears $200,000. Google parent Alphabet Inc. said its workers earned a median pay package of more than $197,000 last year, the fourth-highest pay among the hundreds of companies in the S&P 500 index that have disclosed those figures, the Journal’s Douglas MacMillan reports . Alphabet’s median pay was about 18% lower than at Facebook Inc ., where employees earned a median salary of $240,000. The highest median pay reported in the S&P 500 so far was by Incyte Corp. , a Wilmington, Del., biotechnology firm with 1,208 employees. Incyte’s median pay was about $253,000.\nToo late? Reuters reports that Google co-founder Sergy Brin used Alphabet’s annual shareholder letter to call on tech companies to take greater responsibility for the social impact of their work.\nIn Europe, Amazon.com remains out of fashion. Amazon.com Inc.’ s first international foray was in Europe two decades ago, but it is still playing catchup selling apparel and footwear online to Europeans, the WSJ’s Jeanette Neumann and Laura Stevens report . Retail executives and analysts point to an absence of top fashion brands, a website they say isn’t conducive to browsing for clothes and a fragmented market full of plucky competitors.\nApple’s big payday will only go so far. The launch of three new iPhone models last year—including the redesigned iPhone X—seems to have cooled early, setting the company up a potentially difficult report for its fiscal second quarter, coming Tuesday afternoon. The Journal’s Dan Gallagher has more .\nThe race for 5G is heating up sooner than expected. And that is promising to benefit two struggling Nordic telecommunications-equipment makers, Ericsson AB of Sweden and Finland’s Nokia Corp. just as their two largest competitors—both from China—are hitting potentially serious hurdles. The Journal’s Stu Woo has more .\nEVERYTHING ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW\nAs financial firms have come under pressure from both sides in the gun debate, banks and credit-card companies are discussing how they could track gun purchases in their payment systems . (WSJ)\nThe dollar is rallying after floundering for most of the past year, another sign that global growth momentum may be shifting back to the U.S. and away from other major economies. (WSJ)\nWalmart said it would sell its British arm Asda to rival J Sainsbury, a deal that values the chain at about $10 billion and would, if successful, create the largest player in the U.K.’s fiercely competitive grocery market. (WSJ)\nWalt Disney’s “Avengers: Infinity War” set new records for the biggest domestic and global opening of all time this weekend, collecting an estimated $250 million in the U.S. and Canada and $630 million around the world.
