    "text": "TORONTO, April 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BRIO GOLD INC. (“BRIO GOLD” or the “Company”) (TSX:BRIO) herein announces the voting results from the Company's Special Meeting held on April 12, 2018 (the \"Meeting\"). At the Meeting, shareholders of the Company were asked to consider and, if deemed advisable, to approve a special resolution (the “Arrangement Resolution”) authorizing the proposed plan of arrangement (the “Arrangement”) of Brio Gold under section 182 of the Business Corporations Act (Ontario), whereby Leagold Mining Corporation will acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Brio Gold pursuant to an arrangement agreement dated February 15, 2018.\nThe Arrangement Resolution required the approval of: (i) at least two-thirds of the votes cast by Shareholders; and (ii) at least a simple majority of the votes cast by Shareholders, excluding the votes cast by certain persons whose votes were required to be excluded in determining minority approval of a business combination pursuant to Multilateral Instrument 61-101 – Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (“MI 61-101”).\nAt the Meeting, Shareholders approved the Arrangement Resolution with approximately 99.99% of the votes cast at the Meeting in favour of the Arrangement (99.99% excluding the votes cast by certain persons whose votes were required to be excluded in determining minority approval of a business combination pursuant to MI 61-101).\nBrio Gold will be seeking a final order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Commercial List) with respect to the Arrangement on April 17, 2018 and the Arrangement is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2018.\nAbout Brio Gold\nBrio Gold is an established Canadian mining company with significant gold producing, development and exploration stage properties in Brazil. Brio Gold’s portfolio includes three operating gold mines and a fully-permitted, fully-constructed mine that was on care and maintenance and currently is in development to be re-started. Brio Gold is expected to produce 205,000 to 235,000 ounces of gold in 2018 and at full run-rate is expected to produce approximately 400,000 ounces of gold annually in 2019.\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT:\nLetitia Wong\nVice President, Corporate Development\nTelephone: +1 (416) 860-6310\nEmail: info@briogoldinc.com\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS: This news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and forward-looking information within the meaning of Canadian securities laws (together, \"forward-looking statements\").
