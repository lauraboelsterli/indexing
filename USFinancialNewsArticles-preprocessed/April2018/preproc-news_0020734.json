REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader \n“I believe in this situation around 60 (dollars per barrel) is a good price,” said Zangeneh, who was attending the International Energy Forum. \n“I think we should look at the market not for short-term, long-term, mid-term is important for us,” he said. “It is very important for producers and consumers not to have volatility in the market.” \nWhen asked if global benchmark Brent oil trading at $70 a barrel were too high, Zangeneh answered, “Yes.” \nZangeneh added that he hopes India and Iran can finalise the main issue on the development of the Farzad B natural gas field in the next two months.
