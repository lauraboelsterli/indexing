    "text": "Seoul, Korea, April 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nGRAVITY REPORTS FIRST QUARTER OF 2018 RESULTS AND BUSINESS UPDATES\nSeoul, South Korea – April 27, 2018 – GRAVITY Co., Ltd. (NasdaqCM: GRVY) (“Gravity” or “Company”), a developer and publisher of online and mobile games based in South Korea, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, prepared in accordance with international Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 HIGHLIGHTS\nTotal revenues were KRW 66,311 million (US$ 62,499 thousand), representing a 1.8% decrease from the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 (“QoQ”) and a 184.0% increase from the first quarter ended March 31, 2017 (“YoY”). Operating profit was KRW 4,820 million (US$ 4,543 thousand), representing a 63.9% increase QoQ and a 46.1% increase YoY. Profit before income tax expenses was KRW 5,117 million (US$ 4,823 thousand), representing a 76.8% increase QoQ and a 51.3% increase YoY. Net profit attributable to parent company was KRW 3,549 million (US$ 3,345 thousand), representing a 27.5% decrease QoQ and a 63.5% increase YoY.\nREVIEW OF FIRST QUARTER 2018 FINANCIAL RESULTS\nRevenues\nSubscription revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were KRW 8,896 million (US$ 8,385 thousand), representing a 16.1% increase QoQ from KRW 7,661 million and a 9.7% decrease YoY from KRW 9,855 million. The increase QoQ was mainly attributable to increased revenues from Ragnarok Online in Korea and Ragnarok Prequel in the Philippines. Ragnarok Prequel was launched in the Philippines on December 12, 2017. The decrease YoY was largely due to decreased revenues from Ragnarok Prequel and Ragnarok Online in Taiwan, which was partially offset by increased revenues from Ragnarok Online in Korea..\nRoyalty and license fee revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were KRW 4,619 million (US$ 4,353 thousand), representing a 2.4% decrease QoQ from KRW 4,731 million and a 3.2% increase YoY from KRW 4,475 million. The decrease QoQ was primarily due to a revenue recognition related to Ragnarok Online II in china based on a game development and publishing agreement in the fourth quarter 2017, which did not incur in the first quarter of 2018. This decrease was partially offset by increased revenue from Ragnarok Online in Japan. The increase YoY resulted mainly from increased revenues from Ragnarok Online in Japan, Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia.\nMobile game and application revenues were KRW 51,396 million (US$ 48,441 thousand) for the first quarter of 2018, representing a 2.3% decrease QoQ from KRW 52,592 million and a 537.4% increase YoY from KRW 8,063 million. The decrease QoQ resulted primarily from decreased revenues from global service of RO: Idle Poring, except for Japan and China; and Ragnarok M in Taiwan. Such decrease was partially offset by increased revenues from Ragnarok M , which was officially launched in Korea on March 14, 2018. The increase YoY was primarily due to revenues from Ragnarok M in Taiwan and Korea, which was launched on October 12, 2017 and on March 14, 2018, respectively.\nCharacter merchandising and other revenues were KRW 1,400 million (US$ 1,320 thousand) for the first quarter of 2018, representing 44.8% decrease from KRW 2,537 million and a 46% increase YoY from KRW 959 million\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue was KRW 45,784 million (US$ 43,152 thousand) for the first quarter of 2018, representing a 11.1% decrease QoQ from KRW 51,521 million and a 234.8% increase YoY from KRW 13,675 million. The decrease QoQ was mainly due to decreased commission paid for mobile game services and outsourcing fees. The increase YoY was mostly from increased commission paid for game services related to Ragnarok M in Taiwan and Korea; and RO: Idle Poring in global markets except for China and Japan.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses were KRW 15,707 million (US$ 14,804 thousand) for the first quarter of 2018, representing a 20.3% increase QoQ from KRW 13,059 million and a 146.3% increase YoY from KRW 6,378 million. The increase QoQ was mainly attributable to increased advertising expenses related to pre-launch marketing for Ragnarok M and RO: Idle Poring in Korea. The increase YoY was mostly resulted from increased advertising expenses for Ragnarok M and RO: Idle Poring in Korea; and research and development expenses.\nProfit before income tax expenses\nProfit before income tax expenses was KRW 5,117 million (US$ 4,823 thousand) for the first quarter of 2018 compared with profit before income tax expense of KRW 2,895 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and profit before income tax expenses of KRW 3,382 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nNet Profit\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, Gravity recorded a net profit attributable to parent company of KRW 3,549 million (US$ 3,345 thousand) for the first quarter of 2018 compared with net profit attributable to parent company of KRW 4,898 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and a net profit attributable to parent company of KRW 2,170 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nLiquidity\nThe balance of cash and cash equivalents and short-term financial instruments was KRW 57,397 million (US$ 54,097 thousand) as of March 31, 2018.\nNote: For convenience purposes only, the KRW amounts have been expressed in U.S. dollars at the exchange rate of KRW 1,060.99 to US$ 1.00, the noon buying rate in effect on March 30, 2018 as Quote: d by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\nGRAVITY BUSINESS UPDATE\nRagnarok Online IP-based Games\nRagnarok M, an MMORPG mobile game\nGravity launched Ragnarok M in Korea on March 14, 2018.
