    "text": "STOCKHOLM, April 16 (Reuters) - Swedish apartment prices fell 7 percent in the January-March period from the same period a year earlier, data from an association of Swedish real estate agents showed on Monday.\nPrices of single-family homes increased 1 percent, the Svensk Maklarstatistik association said.\nCompared with the December-February period, apartment prices were down 1 percent while single-family home prices were up 1 percent.\nHome prices in the Nordic country have surged since the mid-1990s, leaving households among the most indebted in Europe. Swedish authorities as well as the European Commission and the IMF have for long warned debt levels are a serious threat to the economy.\nThe countryâ€™s financial watchdog has introduced a number of regulations in recent years to cool down the overheated housing market, including mortgage-repayment rules on big borrowers.
