    "text": "MARIETTA, Ga., April 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Deep Green Waste & Recycling, Inc. (OTCMarkets: DGWR) reported $9,875,869 in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 which represents an increase of $2,347,091 or 31% versus $7,528,778 in 2016. Gross profit margin for the company increased by 43.3% over the same period. Deep Green incurred an EBITDA operating loss of $843,491 in 2017 compared to a $498,330 loss in 2016.\n\"2017 was a momentous year for Deep Green. We achieved very good revenue growth and increase in gross profits. We also closed our first acquisitions in the fourth quarter. Throughout 2017 we invested heavily in organizational structure and professional services to pursue our organic growth and acquisition strategy, which put significant stress on operating margins. To help improve margins, in addition to concentrating only on higher margin business coming in, we are reviewing all existing managed service contracts to improve or eliminate low margin performers. On the acquisition front, we are pursuing several candidates both in the managed services business and in the equipment sales and service segment,\" stated David Bradford, Chief Operating Officer. \"We believe our overall strategy of organic growth and acquisitions in managed waste services combined vertically with tactical geographic acquisitions and development of fixed waste equipment sales and service centers will continue to create value for our shareholders.\"\nAbout Deep Green\nWe are a full-service waste & recycling company that manages services to and logistics for large commercial properties throughout the continental U.S. We have presence in 35 states across the Midwest, South and East regions of the United States, and serve approximately 300 commercial customers. www.deepgreenwaste.com\nWe also provide complete waste equipment handling solutions, which includes design, engineering, fabrication and installation of new and used equipment along with maintenance services through our wholly owned subsidiary, Compaction and Recycling Equipment Inc. www.waste-equipment.com\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current beliefs, expectations or intentions regarding future events.
