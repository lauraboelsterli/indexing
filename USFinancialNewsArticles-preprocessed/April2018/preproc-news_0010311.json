    "text": "Sean Manaea cruised through eight effective innings as the Oakland Athletics continued their home success over the Texas Rangers with a 6-2 victory on Wednesday.\nManaea (1-1) allowed one run and three hits as Oakland beat Texas at home for the 10th time in the last 11 meetings at Oakland Coliseum. He won his third straight start over Texas by throwing 64 of 94 pitches for strikes and getting first-pitch strikes on 20 of 27 hitters.\nThe right-hander struck out four, issued one walk, recorded 10 ground-ball outs and was assisted by two double plays. He recorded Oakland’s first win by a starting pitcher as the team’s starters avoided dropping their first five decisions for the first time since going 0-7 to begin 1979.\nManaea tied a career high by pitching eight innings for the second time. He also pitched eight innings July 22, 2016, against the Tampa Bay Rays.\nJed Lowrie hit a two-run single while Marcus Semien, Matt Olson and Bruce Maxwell also drove in runs for Oakland.\nRyan Rua drove in the first run and Shin-Soo Choo homered in the ninth for Texas, which scored two runs or fewer for the fourth time in its first seven games.\nRangers right-hander Doug Fister (1-1) allowed five runs — two earned — on seven hits in 3 2/3 innings.\nThe Athletics took a 1-0 lead with two outs in the second on Maxwell’s double to deep left field that scored Matt Chapman from first base.\nFister loaded the bases with nobody out in the fourth, and Oakland took a 2-0 lead when Texas catcher Robinson Chirinos dropped the ball trying to make a swipe tag on Chapman after catching a high throw from first baseman Joey Gallo.\nOakland went up 3-0 on a sacrifice fly to the center field warning track by Semien and took a five-run lead on Lowrie’s base hit to right-center field that knocked out Fister.\nManaea put two on with nobody out in the fifth but escaped by getting Jurickson Profar on a fly ball to right fielder Chad Pinder, who made a running catch. After allowing a run on Rua’s forceout, Manaea struck out Carlos Tocci.\nOakland loaded the bases with no outs in the seventh and scored its sixth run on Olson’s base hit off Jesse Chavez.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
