    "text": "2 COMMENTS New York\nTom Stoppard’s “Travesties,” in which James Joyce, Vladimir Lenin and Tristan Tzara, Dada’s founding father, share a stage to lunatic effect, was the unlikeliest Broadway semi-hit of 1975 (it ran for 156 much-discussed performances). Some theatergoers found “Travesties” impenetrably complex, but everybody had an opinion about it, and Mr. Stoppard was thereafter viewed on this side of the Atlantic as a man of consequence. Now he’s the greatest living English-speaking playwright, more or less, and “Travesties” is back on Broadway at last, this time in the Roundabout Theatre Company’s transfer of Patrick Marber’s 2017 London staging. The last two Broadway revivals of Mr. Stoppard’s work, David Leveaux’s “Arcadia” and Sam Gold’s “The Real Thing,” were lackluster, but this “Travesties” is a total success: The staging is outrageously vital and the cast is as close to ideal as it’s possible to imagine.\nTravesties\nRoundabout Theatre Company, American Airlines Theatre, 227 W. 42nd St.\n$49-$149, closes June 17, 212-719-1300\n‘Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Parts One and Two’ I couldn’t begin to summarize “Travesties” accurately in a review three times as long as this one. I’ll say only that it’s a whirligig variation on “The Importance of Being Earnest” in which Mr. Stoppard, having taken note of the unlikely but true fact that Joyce, Lenin and Tzara (played here by Peter McDonald, Dan Butler and Seth Numrich ) were all in Zurich in 1917, uses that coincidence as the point of departure for a farce-flavored fantasy. The play’s real subject, one long beloved of Mr. Stoppard, is the double-edged effect of the coming of modernity to the West. Hence it is as darkly serious as it is crazily funny, and you don’t have to get all of the highbrow jokes (in fact, you probably won’t) to relish the fizzing éclat with which “Travesties” reminds us that whenever artists and revolutionaries turn the world upside down, things—and people—have a way of getting broken.\nIn addition to the Broadway transfer of the original Royal Shakespeare Theatre production, I’ve seen “Travesties” done twice, by New Haven’s Long Wharf Theatre in 2005 and Wisconsin’s American Players Theatre in 2014. All of those productions were extraordinarily fine, and so is this one, in which Tom Hollander is sensational as Henry Carr, the senile British diplomat in whose fast-crumbling memory the events of “Travesties” purport to take place. His eyes glitter with demented glee as he leads his colleagues through Mr. Stoppard’s intellectual high-wire act. This is a play in which everybody gets a chance to do verbal handsprings, and there’s no point in singling out any of the supporting players, since they’re all as good as Mr. Hollander.\nYou’re never going to see a finer revival of “Travesties,” so catch this one while you can.\nMr. Teachout, the Journal’s drama critic, is the author, most recently, of “Billy and Me.” ",
