    "text": "April 14, 2018 / 12:33 PM / Updated 40 minutes ago Trump: 'mission accomplished' on 'perfectly executed' Syria strike Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Twitter praised Western air strikes against the Syrian government on Saturday as “perfectly executed”, and added “Mission Accomplished”. \n“A perfectly executed strike last night. Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military. Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!” Trump said in a Twitter post. \nTrump’s message echoed the words of a banner that hung behind former President George W. Bush when he gave a speech in 2003 from the USS Abraham Lincoln, during the Iraq War. \nThat visual dogged Bush’s presidency as the war dragged out, with worsening American casualties, for the remainder of his two terms in office. \n(This version of the story refiles to fix typographical error in paragraph 3). U.S. President Donald Trump makes a statement about Syria at the White House in Washington, U.S., April 13, 2018.
