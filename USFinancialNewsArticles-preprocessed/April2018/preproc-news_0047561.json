    "text": "PAOLI, Pa., April 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Malvern Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:MLVF) (the \"Company\"), parent company of Malvern Bank, National Association (“Malvern” or the “Bank”), today reported operating results for the second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018. Net income amounted to $2.0 million or $0.31 per fully diluted common share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $0.8 million, or 72.5 percent, as compared with net income of $1.2 million, or $0.18 per fully diluted common share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nFor the six months ended March 31, 2018, net income amounted to $2.4 million, or $0.38 per fully diluted common share, compared with net income of $2.1 million, or $0.33 per fully diluted common share, for the six months ended March 31, 2017.\n“We see this as a strong quarter with fundamental strength. Our results for the period reflected a set of positive factors, including strong loan growth, rebounding from the prior quarter, and strong forward momentum for continued loan growth, a widening of the net interest margin, despite a high liquidity pool, favorable credit results, and continued management of operating overhead” indicated Anthony C. Weagley, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nHighlights for the quarter include:\nReturn on average assets (“ROAA”) was 0.77 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to 0.51 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and return on average equity (“ROAE”) was 7.71 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with 4.77 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The Company originated $74.6 million in new loans in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, which was offset by $44.0 million in payoffs, prepayments and amortization from its portfolio, resulting in a net portfolio increase of $30.6 million over the first quarter of fiscal 2018. New loan originations in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 consisted of $6.6 million in residential mortgage loans, $62.4 million in commercial loans, $4.8 million in construction and development loans and $0.8 million in consumer loans.\nNon-performing assets (“NPAs”) were 0.24 percent of total assets at March 31, 2018, compared to 0.18 percent at March 31, 2017 and 0.12 percent at September 30, 2017. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total non-performing loans was 325.2 percent at March 31, 2018, compared to 425.4 percent at March 31, 2017 and 694.1 percent at September 30, 2017.\nThe Company’s ratio of shareholders’ equity to total assets was 9.73 percent at March 31, 2018, compared to 10.25 percent at March 31, 2017, and 9.80 percent at September 30, 2017.\nBook value per common share amounted to $16.03 at March 31, 2018, compared to $15.00 at March 31, 2017 and $15.60 at September 30, 2017.\nThe efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP measure, was 57.7 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 on an annualized basis, compared to 57.4 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and 55.4 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nThe Company’s balance sheet reflected total asset growth of $37.3 million at March 31, 2018, compared to September 30, 2017, coupled with stable asset quality, and capital levels that exceeded regulatory standards for a well-capitalized institution.\nSelected Financial Ratios (unaudited; annualized where applicable) As of or for the quarter ended : 3/31/18 12/31/17 9/30/17 6/30/17 3/31/17 Return on average assets 0.77 % 0.15 % 0.77 % 0.70 % 0.51 % Return on average equity 7.71 % 1.55 % 7.70 % 6.90 % 4.77 % Net interest margin (tax equivalent basis) (1) 2.58 % 2.47 % 2.76 % 2.72 % 2.75 % Loans / deposits ratio 102.38 % 102.19 % 106.55 % 106.30 % 107.80 % Shareholders’ equity / total assets 9.73 % 9.76 % 9.80 % 9.93 % 10.25 % Efficiency ratio (1) 57.65 % 63.6 % 55.4 % 57.0 % 57.4 % Book value per common share $ 16.03 $ 15.70 $ 15.60 $ 15.28 $ 15.00 Information reconciling non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures is presented elsewhere in this press release.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income on a fully tax-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP measure, was $6.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, increasing $0.6 million, or 9.2 percent, from $6.0 million for the comparable three-month period in fiscal 2017. The change for the three months ended March 31, 2018 primarily was the result of an increase in the average balance of interest earning assets, which increased $143.8 million. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company’s net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP measure, decreased to 2.58 percent as compared to 2.75 percent for the same three-month period in fiscal 2017.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, total interest income on a fully tax-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP measure, increased $1.5 million, or 18.3 percent, to $9.7 million, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. Interest income rose in the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to the comparable period in fiscal 2017, primarily due to a $110.1 million increase in the average balance of our loans. Total interest expense increased by $0.9 million, or 43.6 percent, to $3.1 million, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period in fiscal 2017 due to the increase of $130.0 million in average funding sources.\nThe 43.6 percent increase in interest expense for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase in deposits, as well as the interest expense associated with the Company’s subordinated debt. The average cost of funds was 1.39 percent for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to 1.13 percent for the same three-month period in fiscal 2017 and, on a linked sequential quarter basis, increased two basis points compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase in cost was primarily related to the increase in average volume, coupled with the increased expense related to the issuance of subordinated debt.\nFor the six months ended March 31, 2018, total interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis increased $3.9 million, or 25.2 percent, to $19.3 million, compared to $15.4 million for the six months ended March 31, 2017. Total interest expense increased by $2.2 million, or 54.7 percent, to $6.3 million, for the six months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the comparable period in fiscal 2017. Interest income rose for the six months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the comparable period in fiscal 2017 primarily due to a $160.9 million increase in average loan balances. Compared to the same period in fiscal 2017, for the six months ended March 31, 2018, average interest earning assets increased $189.5 million, the net interest spread decreased on an annualized tax-equivalent basis by twenty basis points and the net interest margin decreased on an annualized tax-equivalent basis by eighteen basis points.\nJoseph Gangemi, Chief Financial Officer of Malvern Bancorp, Inc., added, \"Despite our asset growth this period, we continue to maintain a high liquidity position, which has a dampening effect on our margin. While we anticipate robust growth in loans this year, we continue to replenish the liquidity pool at a commensurate rate, therefore the traction to increase margin has been more gradual.\"\nEarnings Summary for the Period Ended March 31, 2018\nThe following table presents condensed consolidated statements of income data for the periods indicated.\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data) For the quarter ended: 3/31/18 12/31/17 9/30/17 6/30/17 3/31/17 Net interest income $ 6,568 $ 6,382 $ 6,707 $ 6,399 $ 5,991 Provision for loan losses 240 — 489 645 997 Net interest income after provision for loan losses 6,328 6,382 6,218 5,754 4,994 Other income 449 1,711 532 814 542 Other expense 4,105 4,471 3,813 3,986 3,778 Income before income tax expense 2,672 3,622 2,937 2,582 1,758 Income tax expense 654 3,219 982 863 588 Net income $ 2,018 $ 403 $ 1,955 $ 1,719 $ 1,170 Earnings per common share Basic $ 0.31 $ 0.06 $ 0.30 $ 0.27 $ 0.18 Diluted $ 0.31 $ 0.06 $ 0.30 $ 0.27 $ 0.18 Weighted average common shares outstanding: Basic 6,448,691 6,445,264 6,441,731 6,443,515 6,427,309 Diluted 6,452,246 6,450,513 6,445,151 6,445,288 6,427,932 Other Income\nOther income decreased $0.1 million, or 17.2 percent, for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with the same period in fiscal 2017. The decrease in other income was primarily due to a decrease of $37,000 in service charges and other fees, a $58,000 decrease in net gains on sales of investment securities, a $4,000 decrease in net gains on sale of loans, and a $6,000 decrease in earnings on bank-owned insurance offset by an $12,000 increase in rental income.\nFor the six months ended March 31, 2018, total other income increased $1.2 million compared to the same period in fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of a $1.2 million net gain on the sale of real estate, an increase of $11,000 in service charges, a $23,000 increase in rental income, and an $18,000 increase in net gains on sale of loans offset by a $58,000 decrease in net gains on sales of investment securities and a $15,000 decrease in earnings on bank-owned insurance.\nThe following table presents the components of other income for the periods indicated.\n(in thousands, unaudited) For the quarter ended: 3/31/18 12/31/17 9/30/17 6/30/17 3/31/17 Service charges on deposit accounts $ 237 $ 271 $ 262 $ 233 $ 274 Rental income – other 67 66 66 51 55 Net gains on sales of investments, net — — 31 374 58 Gain on sale of real estate, net — 1,186 — — — Gain on sale of loans, net 26 67 48 31 30 Bank-owned life insurance 119 121 125 125 125 Total other income $ 449 $ 1,711 $ 532 $ 814 $ 542 Other Expense\nTotal other expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018, increased $0.3 million, or 8.7 percent, when compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increase primarily reflected increases in salaries and employee benefits of $0.2 million, a $0.1 million increase in occupancy expense, a $0.1 million increase in professional fees, and a $0.1 million increase in other operating expense. The increase was offset by a $16,000 decrease in the federal deposit insurance premium, a $35,000 decrease in advertising expense, and a $34,000 decrease in data processing expense. The increase in salaries and employee benefits primarily reflects higher compensation and related costs due to added staff to support overall franchise growth. The increase in occupancy expense was mainly due to expanded locations. Professional fees increased for the period as a result of expense related to increased legal and accounting fees.\nFor the six months ended March 31, 2018, total other expense increased $1.2 million, or 16.7 percent, compared to the same period in fiscal 2017. The increase primarily reflected increases in salaries and employee benefits of $0.5 million, a $0.1 million increase in occupancy expense, a $0.1 million increase in the federal deposit insurance premium, a $0.4 million increase in professional fees, and a $0.2 million increase in other operating expense. The increase was offset by a $0.1 million decrease in data processing expense and a $32,000 decrease in advertising expense.\nThe following table presents the components of other expense for the periods indicated.\n(in thousands, unaudited) For the quarter ended: 3/31/18 12/31/17 9/30/17 6/30/17 3/31/17 Salaries and employee benefits $ 2,001 $ 1,990 $ 1,725 $ 1,873 $ 1,804 Occupancy expense 586 562 543 533 514 Federal deposit insurance premium 75 76 71 78 91 Advertising 38 54 25 67 73 Data processing 267 278 285 308 301 Professional fees 450 788 473 621 399 Other operating expenses 688 723 691 506 596 Total other expense $ 4,105 $ 4,471 $ 3,813 $ 3,986 $ 3,778 Statement of Condition Highlights at March 31, 2018\nHighlights as of March 31, 2018, included:\nBalance sheet strength, with total assets amounting to $1.1 billion at March 31, 2018, an increase of $37.3 million, or 3.6 percent, compared to September 30, 2017.

The Company's current \"Approved, Accepted but Unfunded\" pipeline, includes approximately $54.0 million in commercial and construction loans and $15.7 million in residential mortgage loans expected to fund over the next 90 days.\nAsset Quality\nMr. Weagley noted that “asset quality remained stable, and we are well positioned from an asset quality perspective, with continued improving trends and a low ratio of non-performing assets to total assets of 0.24 percent.”\nNon-accrual loans were $2.1 million at March 31, 2018 an increase of $1.1 million or 105.1 percent, as compared to $1.0 million at September 30, 2017.

The increase in non-performing loans at March 31, 2018 compared to September 30, 2017 was primarily due to one legacy commercial loan, with an aggregate outstanding balance of approximately $0.6 million moving to non-accrual status.

The Company's management believes that the supplemental non-GAAP information provided in this press release is utilized by market analysts and others to evaluate a company's financial condition and, therefore, that such information is useful to investors. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures presented by other companies.\nThe Company’s other income is presented in the table below including and excluding net investment securities gains. The Company’s management believes that many investors desire to evaluate other income without regard to such gains.\n(in thousands) For the quarter ended: 3/31/18 12/31/17 9/30/17 6/30/17 3/31/17 Other income $ 449 $ 1,711 $ 532 $ 814 $ 542 Less: Net investment securities\ngains and gains on sale of real\nestate — 1,186 31 374 58 Other income, excluding net\ninvestment securities gains and\ngains on sale of real estate $ 449 $ 525 $ 501 $ 440 $ 484 “Efficiency ratio” is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as other expense, excluding certain non-core items, as a percentage of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis plus other income, excluding net securities gains, calculated as follows:\n(dollars in thousands) For the quarter ended: 3/31/18 12/31/17 9/30/17 6/30/17 3/31/17 Other expense $ 4,105 $ 4,471 $ 3,813 $ 3,986 $ 3,778 Less: non-core items (1) 43 72 29 72 29 Other expense, excluding non-core items $ 4,062 $ 4,399 $ 3,784 $ 3,914 $ 3,749 Net interest income (tax\nequivalent basis) $ 6,597 $ 6,393 $ 6,729 $ 6,433 $ 6,043 Other income, excluding net\ninvestment securities gains and\ngains on sale of real estate 449 525 501 440 484 Total $ 7,046 $ 6,918 $ 7,230 $ 6,873 $ 6,527 Efficiency ratio 57.7 % 63.6 % 52.3 % 57.0 % 57.4 % (1) Included in non-core items are costs which include expenses related to the Company’s corporate restructuring initiatives, such as professional fees, litigation and settlement costs, severance costs, and external payroll development costs related to such restructuring initiatives. The Company believes these adjustments are necessary to provide the most accurate measure of core operating results as a means to evaluate comparative results . The Company’s efficiency ratio, calculated on a GAAP basis without excluding net investment securities gains and without deducting non-core items from other expense, follows:\nFor the quarter ended: 3/31/18 12/31/17 9/30/17 6/30/17 3/31/17 Efficiency ratio on a GAAP basis 58.5 % 55.2 % 52.7 % 55.3 % 57.8 % Net interest margin, which is non-interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets, is presented on a fully tax equivalent (“TE”) basis as we believe this non-GAAP measure is the preferred industry measurement for this item. The Company revised its estimated annual effective rate to reflect a change in the federal statutory rate from 35% to 21%, resulting from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The TE basis adjusts GAAP interest income and yields for the tax benefit of income on certain tax-exempt investments using the blended statutory rate of 24.5% for the current period and 34% for each of the prior periods presented. Below is a reconciliation of GAAP net interest income to the TE basis and the related GAAP basis and TE net interest margins for the periods presented.\n(dollars in thousands) For the quarter ended: 3/31/18 12/31/17 9/30/17 6/30/17 3/31/17 Net interest income (GAAP) $ 6,568 $ 6,382 $ 6,707 $ 6,399 $ 5,991 Tax-equivalent adjustment (1) 29 11 22 34 52 TE net interest income $ 6,597 $ 6,393 $ 6,729 $ 6,433 $ 6,043 Net interest income margin (GAAP) 2.57 % 2.46 % 2.75 % 2.71 % 2.72 % Tax-equivalent effect 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.03 Net interest margin (TE) 2.58 % 2.47 % 2.75 % 2.72 % 2.75 %",
