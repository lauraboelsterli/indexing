    "text": "CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. All per share results are reported as available to common shares/units on a diluted basis. Earnings per Share (EPS) was $0.57, Funds From Operations (FFO) was $0.71 per share and Normalized FFO was $0.77 per share for the first quarter of 2018, each as described in further detail below.\n“The demand for rental housing across the nation’s coastal, gateway cities remains very strong but, like last year, new apartment supply continues to limit growth in new lease rates,” said David J. Neithercut, Equity Residential’s President and CEO. “We are pleased to have delivered first quarter results in line with our expectations driven by strong renewal rate growth of 4.6%. As we approach our primary leasing season with occupancy of 96.3% and a company-wide focus on resident retention, we remain well positioned to meet our operating goals for the year.”\nHighlights\nIncreased same store revenues by 2.2% over the first quarter of 2017. Achieved same store Physical Occupancy of 96.0% and a 1.9% increase in Average Rental Rate. Increased the Company’s 2018 annualized common share dividend by 7.2%. Issued $500.0 million of 10-year unsecured notes at a coupon of 3.5%, representing the lowest credit spread (80 basis points) of any 10-year REIT benchmark offering in history.\nFirst Quarter 2018\nEPS for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.57 compared to $0.39 in the first quarter of 2017. The difference is due primarily to higher property sale gains in the first quarter of 2018, the various adjustment items listed on page 22 of this release and the items described below.\nFFO as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) was $0.71 per share for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.76 per share in the first quarter of 2017. The difference is due primarily to the various adjustment items listed on page 22 of this release and the items described below.\nNormalized FFO for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.77 per share compared to $0.74 per share in the first quarter of 2017. The difference is due primarily to:\nA positive impact of approximately $0.02 per share from increased same store net operating income (NOI); A positive impact of approximately $0.02 per share from Lease-Up NOI; and A negative impact of approximately $0.01 per share from other items including higher corporate overhead (property management and general and administrative expenses).\nThe Company has a glossary of defined terms and related reconciliations of Non-GAAP financial measures on pages 24 through 28 of this release. Reconciliations and definitions of FFO and Normalized FFO are provided on pages 5, 25 and 26 of this release and the Company has included guidance for Normalized FFO on page 23 and FFO and EPS on page 26 of this release.\nSame Store Results\nOn a same store first quarter to first quarter comparison, which includes 72,204 apartment units, revenues increased 2.2%, expenses increased 3.9% and NOI increased 1.5%. Average Rental Rate increased 1.9% and Physical Occupancy increased by 0.1% to 96.0%.\nInvestment Activity\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company acquired a 117-unit consolidated apartment property located in Seattle for a purchase price of approximately $53.7 million and an Acquisition Capitalization Rate of 4.6%. During the quarter, the Company sold a consolidated apartment property in each of New York City, the New York suburbs, suburban Seattle and suburban Los Angeles, totaling 786 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of approximately $290.0 million, at a weighted average Disposition Yield of 4.4%, generating an Unlevered IRR of 8.1%. Also during the quarter, the Company completed 855 Brannan, a 449-unit apartment development project in San Francisco, for a total cost of approximately $322.2 million and an anticipated Development Yield of 5.1%.\nCapital Markets Activity\nOn February 7, 2018, the Company issued $500.0 million of 10-year unsecured notes maturing March 1, 2028 at a coupon of 3.5% and an all-in effective rate of 3.61% including the effect of underwriters’ fees and the termination of certain interest rate hedges. The Company used the proceeds from this offering to prepay a $550.0 million secured debt pool maturing in 2020. The Company anticipates issuing $300.0 million to $500.0 million of additional debt to prepay a $500.0 million secured debt pool that matures in 2019 but is pre-payable at par in late 2018 (see page 14 for details). The Company anticipates incurring approximately $23.7 million in debt extinguishment costs/prepayment penalties in connection with all of its debt repayment activities in 2018, of which $23.5 million was incurred in the first quarter of 2018, which will not be included in the Company’s Normalized FFO.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Guidance\nThe Company has established an EPS guidance range of $0.36 to $0.40 for the second quarter of 2018. The difference between the Company’s first quarter 2018 EPS of $0.57 and the midpoint of the second quarter 2018 guidance range of $0.38 is due primarily to lower expected gains on property sales, partially offset by lower expected debt extinguishment costs and the items described below.\nThe Company has established an FFO guidance range of $0.77 to $0.81 per share for the second quarter of 2018. The difference between the Company’s first quarter 2018 FFO of $0.71 per share and the midpoint of the second quarter 2018 guidance range of $0.79 per share is due primarily to lower expected debt extinguishment costs and the items described below.\nThe Company has established a Normalized FFO guidance range of $0.77 to $0.81 per share for the second quarter of 2018. The difference between the Company’s first quarter 2018 Normalized FFO of $0.77 per share and the midpoint of the second quarter 2018 guidance range of $0.79 per share is due primarily to:\nA positive impact of approximately $0.01 per share from increased same store NOI; and A positive impact of approximately $0.01 per share from other items including lower corporate overhead (property management and general and administrative expenses).\nSecond Quarter 2018 Earnings and Conference Call\nEquity Residential expects to announce its second quarter 2018 results on Tuesday, July 24, 2018 and host a conference call to discuss those results at 10:00 a.m. CT on Wednesday, July 25, 2018.\nAbout Equity Residential\nEquity Residential is an S&P 500 company focused on the acquisition, development and management of rental apartment properties in urban and high-density suburban coastal gateway markets where today’s renters want to live, work and play.

The definitions and calculations of these non-GAAP financial measures and other terms may differ from the definitions and methodologies used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings or any other measurement of performance computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) or as an alternative to cash flows from specific operating, investing or financing activities. Furthermore, these non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be a measure of cash flow or liquidity. Acquisition Capitalization Rate or Cap Rate – NOI that the Company anticipates receiving in the next 12 months (or the year two or three stabilized NOI for properties that are in lease-up at acquisition) less an estimate of property management costs/management fees allocated to the project (generally ranging from 2.0% to 4.0% of revenues depending on the size and income streams of the asset) and less an estimate for in-the-unit replacement capital expenditures (generally ranging from $100-$450 per apartment unit depending on the age and condition of the asset) divided by the gross purchase price of the asset. The weighted average Acquisition Cap Rate for acquired properties is weighted based on the projected NOI streams and the relative purchase price for each respective property.\nAverage Rental Rate – Total residential rental revenues reflected on a straight-line basis in accordance with GAAP divided by the weighted average occupied apartment units for the reporting period presented.\nCapital Expenditures to Real Estate:\nBuilding Improvements – Includes roof replacement, paving, building mechanical equipment systems, exterior siding and painting, major landscaping, furniture, fixtures and equipment for amenities and common areas, vehicles and office and maintenance equipment.\nRenovation Expenditures – Apartment unit renovation costs (primarily kitchens and baths) designed to reposition these units for higher rental levels in their respective markets.\nReplacements – Includes appliances, mechanical equipment, fixtures and flooring (including hardwood and carpeting).\nDebt Covenant Compliance – Our unsecured debt includes certain financial and operating covenants including, among other things, maintenance of certain financial ratios. These provisions are contained in the indentures applicable to each notes payable or the credit agreement for our line of credit. The Debt Covenant Compliance ratios that are provided show the Company's compliance with certain covenants governing our public unsecured debt. These covenants generally reflect our most restrictive financial covenants. The Company was in compliance with its unsecured debt covenants for all years presented (the ratios should not be used for any other purpose, including without limitation, to evaluate the Company's financial condition or results of operations, nor do they indicate the Company's covenant compliance as of any other date or for any other period).\nDevelopment Yield – NOI that the Company anticipates receiving in the next 12 months following stabilization less an estimate of property management costs/management fees allocated to the project (generally ranging from 2.0% to 4.0% of revenues depending on the size and income streams of the asset) and less an estimate for in-the-unit replacement capital expenditures (generally ranging from $50-$150 per apartment unit depending on the type of asset) divided by the Total Budgeted Capital Cost of the asset. The weighted average Development Yield for development properties is weighted based on the projected NOI streams and the relative Total Budgeted Capital Cost for each respective property.\nDisposition Yield – NOI that the Company anticipates giving up in the next 12 months less an estimate of property management costs/management fees allocated to the project (generally ranging from 2.0% to 4.0% of revenues depending on the size and income streams of the asset) and less an estimate for in-the-unit replacement capital expenditures (generally ranging from $100-$450 per apartment unit depending on the age and condition of the asset) divided by the gross sale price of the asset. The weighted average Disposition Yield for sold properties is weighted based on the projected NOI streams and the relative sales price for each respective property.\nEarnings Per Share (\"EPS\") – Net income per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Expected EPS is calculated on a basis consistent with actual EPS. Due to the uncertain timing and extent of property dispositions and the resulting gains/losses on sales, actual EPS could differ materially from expected EPS.\nEquity Residential\nAdditional Reconciliations and Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Terms – Continued\n(Amounts in thousands except per share and per apartment unit data) (All per share data is diluted) EBITDA for Real Estate and Normalized EBITDA for Real Estate:\nEarnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (“EBITDAre”) – The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines EBITDAre (September 2017 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP) before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, and further adjusted for gains and losses from sales of depreciated operating properties, impairment write-downs of depreciated operating properties, impairment write-downs of investments in unconsolidated entities caused by a decrease in value of depreciated operating properties within the joint venture and adjustments to reflect the Company’s share of EBITDAre of investments in unconsolidated entities.\nThe Company believes that EBITDAre is useful to investors, creditors and rating agencies as a supplemental measure of the Company’s ability to incur and service debt because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry, and by excluding gains or losses related to sales or impairment of depreciated operating properties, EBITDAre can help compare the Company’s credit strength between periods or as compared to different companies. Normalized Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (“Normalized EBITDAre”) – Represents net income (computed in accordance with GAAP) before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, and further adjusted for non-comparable items. Normalized EBITDAre, total debt to Normalized EBITDAre and net debt to Normalized EBITDAre are important metrics in evaluating the credit strength of the Company and its ability to service its debt obligations. The Company believes that Normalized EBITDAre, total debt to Normalized EBITDAre, and net debt to Normalized EBITDAre are useful to investors, creditors and rating agencies because they allow investors to compare the Company’s credit strength to prior reporting periods and to other companies without the effect of items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period and tend to obscure the Company’s actual credit quality.\nEconomic Gain – Economic Gain is calculated as the net gain (loss) on sales of real estate properties in accordance with GAAP, excluding accumulated depreciation. The Company generally considers Economic Gain to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net gain (loss) on sales of real estate properties in accordance with GAAP because it is one indication of the gross value created by the Company's acquisition, development, rehab, management and ultimate sale of a property and because it helps investors to understand the relationship between the cash proceeds from a sale and the cash invested in the sold property. The following table presents a reconciliation of net gain (loss) on sales of real estate properties in accordance with GAAP to Economic Gain:\nQuarter Ended March 31, 2018 Net Gain (Loss) on Sales of Real Estate Properties $ 142,213 Accumulated Depreciation Gain (63,640 ) Economic Gain $ 78,573 FFO and Normalized FFO:\nFunds From Operations (“FFO”) – NAREIT defines FFO (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales and impairment write-downs of depreciated operating properties, plus depreciation and amortization expense, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Expected FFO per share is calculated on a basis consistent with actual FFO per share and is considered an appropriate supplemental measure of expected operating performance when compared to expected EPS.\nThe Company believes that FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company, because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to sales of depreciated operating properties and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units can help compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. Normalized Funds From Operations (\"Normalized FFO\") – Normalized FFO begins with FFO and excludes:\n• the impact of any expenses relating to non-operating asset impairment and valuation allowances;\n• pursuit cost write-offs;\n• gains and losses from early debt extinguishment and preferred share redemptions;\nEquity Residential\nAdditional Reconciliations and Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Terms – Continued\n(Amounts in thousands except per share and per apartment unit data) (All per share data is diluted) • gains and losses from non-operating assets; and\n• other miscellaneous items.\nExpected Normalized FFO per share is calculated on a basis consistent with actual Normalized FFO per share and is considered an appropriate supplemental measure of expected operating performance when compared to expected EPS. The Company believes that Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company because they allow investors to compare the Company's operating performance to its performance in prior reporting periods and to the operating performance of other real estate companies without the effect of items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period and tend to obscure the Company's actual operating results. FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units do not represent net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units should not be exclusively considered as alternatives to net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies. FFO available to Common Shares and Units and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units are calculated on a basis consistent with net income available to Common Shares and reflects adjustments to net income for preferred distributions and premiums on redemption of preferred shares in accordance with GAAP. The equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units are collectively referred to as the \"Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership\". Subject to certain restrictions, the Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership may exchange their OP Units for Common Shares on a one-for-one basis. The following table presents reconciliations of EPS to FFO per share and Normalized FFO per share for pages 5 and 22 (the expected guidance/projections provided below are based on current expectations and are forward-looking): Actual Actual Expected Expected Q1 2018 Q1 2017 Q2 2018 2018 Per Share Per Share Per Share Per Share EPS - Diluted $ 0.57 $ 0.39 $0.36 to $0.40 $1.75 to $1.85 Add: Depreciation expense 0.51 0.47 0.49 1.96 Less: Net (gain) loss on sales (0.37 ) (0.10 ) (0.08) (0.61) FFO per share - Diluted 0.71 0.76 0.77 to 0.81 3.10 to 3.20 Asset impairment and valuation allowances — — — — Write-off of pursuit costs — — — 0.01 Debt extinguishment and preferred share redemption (gains) losses 0.06 0.03 — 0.06 Non-operating asset (gains) losses — (0.05 ) — — Other miscellaneous items — — — — Normalized FFO per share - Diluted $ 0.77 $ 0.74 $0.77 to $0.81 $3.17 to $3.27 Lease-Up NOI – Represents NOI for development properties: (i) in various stages of lease-up; and (ii) where lease-up has been completed but the properties were not stabilized (defined as having achieved 90% occupancy for three consecutive months) for all of the current and comparable periods presented.\nNet Operating Income (“NOI”) – NOI is the Company’s primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment properties. NOI is defined as rental income less direct property operating expenses (including real estate taxes and insurance). The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of its operating performance because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Company's apartment properties. NOI does not include an allocation of property management expenses either in the current or comparable periods. Rental income for all leases and operating expense for ground leases (for both same store and non-same store properties) are reflected on a straight-line basis in accordance with GAAP for the current and comparable periods.\nThe following tables present reconciliations of operating income per the consolidated statements of operations to NOI, along with rental income, operating expenses and NOI per the consolidated statements of operations allocated between same store and non-same store/other results (see page 9):\nEquity Residential\nAdditional Reconciliations and Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Terms – Continued\n(Amounts in thousands except per share and per apartment unit data) (All per share data is diluted) Quarter Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Operating income $ 196,869 $ 204,371 Adjustments: Fee and asset management revenue (185 ) (180 ) Property management 23,444 22,252 General and administrative 16,278 14,173 Depreciation 196,309 178,968 Total NOI $ 432,715 $ 419,584 Rental income: Same store $ 590,384 $ 577,404 Non-same store/other 42,447 26,516 Total rental income 632,831 603,920 Operating expenses: Same store 180,358 173,605 Non-same store/other 19,758 10,731 Total operating expenses 200,116 184,336 NOI: Same store 410,026 403,799 Non-same store/other 22,689 15,785 Total NOI $ 432,715 $ 419,584 Non-Same Store Properties – For annual comparisons, primarily includes all properties acquired during 2017 and 2018, plus any properties in lease-up and not stabilized as of January 1, 2017.\nPhysical Occupancy – The weighted average occupied apartment units for the reporting period divided by the average of total apartment units available for rent for the reporting period.\nSame Store Properties – For annual comparisons, primarily includes all properties acquired or completed that are stabilized prior to January 1, 2017, less properties subsequently sold. Properties are included in Same Store when they are stabilized for all of the current and comparable periods presented.\n% of Stabilized NOI – Represents budgeted 2018 NOI for stabilized properties and projected annual NOI at stabilization (defined as having achieved 90% occupancy for three consecutive months) for properties that are in lease-up.\nTotal Budgeted Capital Cost – Estimated cost for projects under development and/or developed and all capitalized costs incurred to date plus any estimates of costs remaining to be funded for all projects, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, capitalized real estate taxes and insurance, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees, all in accordance with GAAP.\nTotal Market Capitalization – The aggregate of the market value of the Company’s outstanding common shares, including restricted shares, the market value of the Company’s operating partnership units outstanding, including restricted units (based on the market value of the Company’s common shares) and the outstanding principal balance of debt. The Company believes this is a useful measure of a real estate operating company’s long-term liquidity and balance sheet strength, because it shows an approximate relationship between a company’s total debt and the current total market value of its assets based on the current price at which the Company’s common shares trade. However, because this measure of leverage changes with fluctuations in the Company’s share price, which occur regularly, this measure may change even when the Company’s earnings, interest and debt levels remain stable.\nTurnover – Total residential move-outs divided by total residential apartment units, including inter-property and intra-property transfers.\nUnencumbered NOI % – Represents NOI generated by consolidated real estate assets unencumbered by outstanding secured debt as a percentage of total NOI generated by all of the Company's consolidated real estate assets.\nEquity Residential\nAdditional Reconciliations and Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Terms – Continued\n(Amounts in thousands except per share and per apartment unit data) (All per share data is diluted) Unlevered Internal Rate of Return (“IRR”) – The Unlevered IRR on sold properties is the compound annual rate of return calculated by the Company based on the timing and amount of: (i) the gross purchase price of the property plus any direct acquisition costs incurred by the Company; (ii) total revenues earned during the Company’s ownership period; (iii) total direct property operating expenses (including real estate taxes and insurance) incurred during the Company’s ownership period; (iv) capital expenditures incurred during the Company’s ownership period; and (v) the gross sales price of the property net of selling costs. Each of the items (i) through (v) is calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nThe calculation of the Unlevered IRR does not include an adjustment for the Company’s general and administrative expense, interest expense (including loan assumption costs and other loan-related costs) or property management expense. Therefore, the Unlevered IRR is not a substitute for net income as a measure of our performance. Management believes that the Unlevered IRR achieved during the period a property is owned by the Company is useful because it is one indication of the gross value created by the Company’s acquisition, development, rehab, management and ultimate sale of a property, before the impact of Company overhead. The Unlevered IRR achieved on the properties as cited in this release should not be viewed as an indication of the gross value created with respect to other properties owned by the Company, and the Company does not represent that it will achieve similar Unlevered IRRs upon the disposition of other properties. The weighted average Unlevered IRR for sold properties is weighted based on all cash flows over the investment period for each respective property, including net sales proceeds.\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180424006588/en/\nEquity Residential\nMarty McKenna, (312) 928-1901\nSource: Equity Residential",
