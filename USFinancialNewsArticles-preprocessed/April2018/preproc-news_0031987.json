    "text": "April 19, 2018 / 12:19 PM / Updated an hour ago Daimler open to buying small stake in Volvo cars: Manager Magazin Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ) is open to supplying Volvo with engines and could even take a small stake in the Swedish carmaker, Manager Magazin said, raising the possibility of increased cooperation between Mercedes-Benz and China’s Geely [GEELY.UL]. The Daimler logo is seen before the Daimler annual shareholder meeting in Berlin, Germany, April 5, 2018. REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke \nDaimler could buy “a couple of percent” in Volvo Cars, Manager Magazin said on Thursday, without citing sources. \nVolvo declined to comment and a Daimler spokesman said: “This is pure speculation which we will not comment on.” \nThe chairman of Volvo owner Geely, Li Shufu, stealthily built a $9 billion stake in Daimler by the end of February, seeking to forge an alliance with the German carmaker as a way to counter the threat from new competitors such as Tesla ( TSLA.O ), Google ( GOOGL.O ) and Uber.[nL8N1QD5P5 \nDaimler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche has welcomed the Geely chairman as a new shareholder and said any industrial alliance will depend on whether current China partner BAIC ( 1958.HK ) agrees.
