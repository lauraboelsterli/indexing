    "text": "LONDON, April 25 (LPC) - US cable operator Comcast Corp said on Wednesday that it is backing its offer for Sky Plc with £23bn (US$32.06bn) of loans.\nThe financing is being arranged by Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo.\nThere is an up to £16bn unsecured bridge loan and an up to £7bn unsecured term loan.\nThe bridge loan is expected to be replaced, in whole or in part, by senior unsecured bonds in a public offering or private placement.\nComcast’s £12.50 per share offer represents a premium of around 16% over a rival offer from Twenty-First Century Fox , valuing Sky at around £22bn.
