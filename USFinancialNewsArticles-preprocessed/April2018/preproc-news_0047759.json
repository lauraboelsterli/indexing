All amounts are in US dollars.\nRevenues for the first quarter were $426.5 million, up 12% relative to the same quarter in the prior year, Adjusted EBITDA (note 1) increased 26% to $25.4 million, and Adjusted EPS (note 2) was $0.25, representing 56% growth over the prior year quarter. GAAP Operating Earnings were $11.1 million, relative to $9.0 million in the prior year period. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.17 per share in the quarter, versus $0.12 in the same quarter a year ago.\n“We are pleased to report very strong financial results for the first quarter, reflecting a continuation of the focused execution and healthy market fundamentals that have driven our performance for the past several quarters,” said Scott Patterson, Chief Executive Officer of FirstService. “With a favourable housing and home improvement outlook and recent tuck-under acquisition activity, we have solid momentum towards achieving our growth objectives for the year.”\nAbout FirstService Corporation\nFirstService Corporation is a North American leader in the essential outsourced property services sector, serving its customers through two industry-leading service platforms: FirstService Residential - North America’s largest manager of residential communities; and FirstService Brands - one of North America’s largest providers of essential property services delivered through individually branded franchise systems and company-owned operations.\nFirstService generates US$1.7 billion in annual revenues and has more than 19,000 employees across North America. With significant insider ownership and an experienced management team, FirstService has a long-term track record of creating value and superior returns for shareholders. The Subordinate Voting Shares of FirstService trade on the NASDAQ and the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol “FSV.” More information is available at www.ﬁrstservice.com .\nImpact of New Revenue Recognition Standard\nOn January 1, 2018, as a result of required changes under U.S. GAAP, FirstService adopted the new accounting standard ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and all the related amendments (“New Revenue Standard”) to all contracts using the full retrospective method. Our prior year 2017 financial results as reported herein have been recast in accordance with the New Revenue Standard to provide a consistent comparison to current year results. The impact is confined to our franchised operations within our FirstService Brands segment, particularly as it relates to the timing and recognition of franchise fees, as well as the gross revenue recognition of marketing fund fees. As a result, the effect of the New Revenue Standard on the prior year first quarter results was an increase of $4.4 million to our consolidated revenues, a decrease of $0.6 million to our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, resulting in a 20 basis points decrease to our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA margin, and a decrease of $0.01 to our Adjusted EPS. The same $4.4 million increase to our FirstService Brands revenues and $0.6 million decrease to our FirstService Brands Adjusted EBITDA resulted in an 80 basis point decrease to our FirstService Brands Adjusted EBITDA margin for our recast segmented 2017 first quarter results.\nSegmented Quarterly Results\nFirstService Residential revenues were $284.1 million for the first quarter, up 7% versus the prior year quarter. Organic growth accounted for half of this increase, with performance relatively balanced across our services and geographies. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $17.5 million, up from $14.4 million in the prior year period. GAAP Operating earnings were $11.4 million, up from $9.1 million versus the prior year period. Operating margin expansion was partially driven by ongoing efficiencies, and further amplified during our seasonally weakest first quarter by the contribution of recent acquisitions with a non-seasonal cash flow profile.\nFirstService Brands revenues for the first quarter totalled $142.3 million, up 24% relative to the prior year period. The revenue increase was comprised of 10% organic growth, with the balance coming from tuck-under acquisitions within the past year at our California Closets and Paul Davis Restoration company-owned platforms. During the quarter, organic growth was robust and broad-based across all of our company-owned platforms and franchised operations. Adjusted EBITDA was $11.2 million, a significant increase over the $8.3 million in the prior year quarter. GAAP Operating Earnings were $5.1 million, versus $3.9 million in the prior year quarter. Margin improvement was attributable to the addition of recent, non-seasonal company-owned operations in our seasonally lowest quarter, as well as operating leverage from certain service lines which benefited from strong top-line growth.\nCorporate costs, as presented in Adjusted EBITDA, were $3.2 million in the first quarter, relative to $2.6 million in the prior year period. On a GAAP basis, corporate costs for the quarter were $5.4 million, relative to $4.1 million in the prior year period.\nConference Call\nFirstService will be holding a conference call on Wednesday, April 25, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss results for the first quarter of 2018.

Reconciliation of net earnings to Adjusted EBITDA:\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net earnings, adjusted to exclude: (i) income tax; (ii) other (income) expense; (iii) interest expense; (iv) depreciation and amortization; (v) acquisition-related items; and (vi) stock-based compensation expense. The Company uses adjusted EBITDA to evaluate its own operating performance, its ability to service debt, and as an integral part of its planning and reporting systems. Additionally, this measure is used in conjunction with discounted cash flow models to determine the Company’s overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. Adjusted EBITDA is presented as a supplemental measure because the Company believes such a measure is useful to investors as a reasonable indicator of operating performance, due to the low capital intensity of the Company’s service operations. The Company believes this measure is a financial metric used by many investors to compare companies, especially in the services industry. This measure is not a recognized measure of financial performance under GAAP in the United States, and should not be considered as a substitute for operating earnings, net earnings or cash flow from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s method of calculating adjusted EBITDA may differ from other issuers and accordingly, this measure may not be comparable to measures used by other issuers. A reconciliation of net earnings (loss) to adjusted EBITDA appears below.\nThree months ended (in thousands of US dollars) March 31 2018 2017 Net earnings $ 8,935 $ 8,268 Income tax (672 ) (1,527 ) Other (income) expense (64 ) (95 ) Interest expense, net 2,874 2,325 Operating earnings 11,073 8,971 Depreciation and amortization 11,783 9,495 Acquisition-related items 561 246 Stock-based compensation expense 1,997 1,415 Adjusted EBITDA $ 25,414 $ 20,127 2. Reconciliation of net earnings and net earnings per share to adjusted net earnings and adjusted EPS:\nAdjusted EPS is defined as diluted net earnings per share, adjusted for the effect, after income tax, of: (i) the non-controlling interest redemption increment; (ii) acquisition-related items; (iii) amortization expense related to intangible assets recognized in connection with acquisitions; (iv) stock-based compensation expense; and (v) a stock-based compensation tax adjustment related to a US GAAP change. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because it provides a supplemental way to understand the underlying operating performance of the Company and enhances the comparability of operating results from period to period. Adjusted EPS is not a recognized measure of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as a substitute for diluted net earnings per share, as determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s method of calculating this non-GAAP measure may differ from other issuers and, accordingly, this measure may not be comparable to measures used by other issuers. A reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted net earnings and of diluted net earnings per share to adjusted EPS appears below.\nThree months ended (in thousands of US dollars) March 31 2018 2017 Net earnings $ 8,935 $ 8,268 Non-controlling interest share of earnings (2,320 ) (1,829 ) Acquisition-related items 561 246 Amortization of intangible assets 3,914 3,186 Stock-based compensation expense 1,997 1,415 Stock-based compensation tax adjustment for US GAAP change (2,415 ) (3,743 ) Income tax on adjustments (1,537 ) (1,770 ) Non-controlling interest on adjustments (110 ) (71 ) Adjusted net earnings $ 9,025 $ 5,702 Three months ended (in US dollars) March 31 2018 2017 Diluted net earnings per share $ 0.17 $ 0.12 Non-controlling interest redemption increment 0.01 0.06 Acquisition-related items 0.02 0.01 Amortization of intangible assets, net of tax 0.08 0.05 Stock-based compensation expense, net of tax 0.04 0.02 Stock-based compensation tax adjustment for US GAAP change (0.07 ) (0.10 ) Adjusted EPS $ 0.25 $ 0.16\nFIRSTSERVICE CORPORATION Operating Results (in thousands of US dollars, except per share amounts) Three months ended March 31 (unaudited) 2018 2017 Revenues $ 426,456 $ 380,349 Cost of revenues 298,524 272,279 Selling, general and administrative expenses 104,515 89,358 Depreciation 7,869 6,309 Amortization of intangible assets 3,914 3,186 Acquisition-related items (1) 561 246 Operating earnings 11,073 8,971 Interest expense, net 2,874 2,325 Other (income) expense (64 ) (95 ) Earnings before income tax 8,263 6,741 Income tax (672 ) (1,527 ) Net earnings 8,935 8,268 Non-controlling interest share of earnings 2,320 1,829 Non-controlling interest redemption increment 532 2,147 Net earnings attributable to Company 6,083 4,292 Net earnings per share Basic $ 0.17 $ 0.12 Diluted 0.17 0.12 Adjusted EPS (2) $ 0.25 $ 0.16 Weighted average common shares (thousands) Basic 35,923 35,880 Diluted 36,526 36,561 (1) Acquisition-related items include contingent acquisition consideration fair value adjustments, and transaction costs.\n(2) See definition and reconciliation above.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (in thousands of US dollars) (unaudited) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 58,699 $ 57,187 Restricted cash 10,554 9,707 Accounts receivable 186,474 183,803 Prepaid and other current assets 81,439 73,654 Current assets 337,166 324,351 Other non-current assets 9,507 9,805 Fixed assets 92,454 85,424 Deferred income tax 779 780 Goodwill and intangible assets 455,584 425,764 Total assets $ 895,490 $ 846,124 Liabilities and shareholders' equity Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 145,901 $ 157,260 Other current liabilities 57,000 51,657 Long-term debt - current 3,207 2,751 Current liabilities 206,108 211,668 Long-term debt - non-current 317,231 266,874 Other liabilities 51,060 54,639 Deferred income tax 1,775 1,467 Non-controlling interests 127,966 117,708 Shareholders' equity 191,350 193,768 Total liabilities and equity $ 895,490 $ 846,124 Supplemental balance sheet information Total debt $ 320,438 $ 269,625 Total debt, net of cash 261,739 212,438\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands of US dollars) Three months ended March 31 (unaudited) 2018 2017 Cash provided by (used in) Operating activities Net earnings $ 8,935 $ 8,268 Items not affecting cash: Depreciation and amortization 11,783 9,494 Deferred income tax 308 (3,817 ) Other 2,402 1,670 23,428 15,615 Changes in non cash working capital Accounts receivable 4,078 (290 ) Payables and accruals (14,870 ) (12,046 ) Other (4,334 ) 4,325 Net cash provided by operating activities 8,302 7,604 Investing activities Acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired (29,602 ) (10,363 ) Purchases of fixed assets (10,523 ) (9,968 ) Other investing activities (678 ) (3,181 ) Net cash used in investing activities (40,803 ) (23,512 ) Financing activities Increase in long-term debt, net 50,214 34,353 Purchases of non-controlling interests, net (1,621 ) (3,780 ) Dividends paid to common shareholders (4,400 ) (3,943 ) Other financing activities (9,196 ) (7,317 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 34,997 19,313 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (137 ) 23 Increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 2,359 3,428 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, beginning of period 66,894 56,834 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, end of period $ 69,253 $ 60,262\nSegmented Results (in thousands of US dollars) FirstService FirstService (unaudited) Residential Brands Corporate Consolidated Three months ended March 31 2018 Revenues $ 284,135 $ 142,321 $ - $ 426,456 Adjusted EBITDA 17,476 11,163 (3,225 ) 25,414 Operating earnings 11,366 5,075 (5,368 ) 11,073 2017 Revenues $ 265,853 $ 114,496 $ - $ 380,349 Adjusted EBITDA 14,433 8,299 (2,605 ) 20,127 Operating earnings 9,127 3,897 (4,053 ) 8,971\nCOMPANY CONTACTS:\nD.
