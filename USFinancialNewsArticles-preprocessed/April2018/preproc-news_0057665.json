    "text": "PARIS, April 25 (Reuters) - Central banks need to consider the possibility that they might have to bail out a non-bank financial actor to protect broader financial stability, European Central Bank (ECB) policymaker Philip Lane said on Wednesday.\nSpeaking at a conference at the French central bank, Lane said non-banks were increasingly acting as intermediaries in lending out debt, a role traditionally held by banks with access to central bank liquidity.\nAsked about the possibility that central banks might need to bail out non-banks, Lane said: “In terms of monitoring financial stability, we do need to think about it.” (Reporting by Leigh Thomas; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta)\n ",
