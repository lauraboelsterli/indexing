    "text": "TORONTO, April 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mandalay Resources Corporation (\"Mandalay\" or the \"Company\") (TSX:MND) announced today its production and sales results for the first quarter of 2018.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, Mandalay produced a consolidated 23,172 saleable ounces of gold equivalent and sold 29,151 ounces of gold equivalent.\nMark Sander, President and Chief Executive Officer of Mandalay, commented, “Mandalay’s production and sales results for the first quarter of 2018 place us firmly on track to reach our 2018 production guidance of 101,000 to 113,000 gold equivalent ounces.”\nDr. Sander continued, “Björkdal produced 12,716 ounces of gold in the first quarter of 2018, about 20% higher than the comparative year-ago quarter. Also in the current quarter, Björkdal recorded the second highest sales under Mandalay ownership at 17,677 gold ounces. This occurred as inventory from the record fourth quarter 2017 production was sold. Follow-on revenue due to the high sales volume in the first quarter will strengthen our cash position.”\nDr. Sander concluded, “Costerfield produced 10,456 gold equivalent ounces in the first quarter of 2018. First quarter production was comparatively lower than in the previous year quarter due to expected lower mining grades. We are on track with respect to the capital development program, announced in November 2017, to reach the Brunswick Lode, which we expect will open up additional production fronts and extend mine life. Simultaneously, we are aggressively continuing infill and extensional drilling in the recently announced Youle vein target, for which we released some very encouraging high-grade intercepts earlier this April (see Mandalay April 3, 2018 press release).”\nSaleable production for the three months ended March 31, 2018:\nThe Company produced a total of 19,303 ounces of gold and 605 tonnes of antimony, representing a total of 23,172 ounces of gold equivalent in the first quarter of 2018, versus 21,370 ounces of gold, 741 tonnes of antimony and 435,076 ounces of silver, representing a total of 32,481 ounces of gold equivalent in the first quarter of 2017 when Cerro Bayo was operating.\nThe Björkdal mine (Sweden) produced 12,716 ounces of gold in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to 10,648 ounces of gold in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Costerfield mine (Australia) produced 6,587 ounces of gold and 605 tonnes of antimony in the first quarter of 2018, versus 7,987 ounces of gold and 741 tonnes of antimony in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Cerro Bayo mine (Chile) produced no metal in the first quarter of 2018 because it remains on care and maintenance due to the inundation event of June 2017. By comparison, in the previous year first quarter, it produced 435,076 ounces of silver and 2,735 ounces of gold.\nTable 1 – Saleable Production for the First Quarter 2018 and 2017, and Fourth Quarter 2017\nMetal Source Three months\nended\n31 March\n2018 Three months\nended\n31 March\n2017 Three months\nended\n31 December\n2017 Gold (oz) Björkdal 12,716 10,648 22,035 Costerfield 6,587 7,987 7,222 Cerro Bayo - 2,735 - Total 19,303 21,370 29,257 Antimony (t) Costerfield 605 741 805 Silver (oz) Cerro Bayo - 435,076 - Average quarterly prices: Gold US$/oz 1,329 1,217 1,275 Antimony US$/t 8,499 8,058 8,137 Silver US$/oz 16.77 17.36 16.71 Au Eq.
