    "text": "CHICAGO, April 17 (Reuters) - Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans on Tuesday said he is optimistic that inflation will reach 2 percent, and is beginning to see underlying movement toward that goal.\nBut, he said, he doesn’t see much pressure beyond 2 percent. Earlier in a talk at the Chicago Rotary Club he said he does not foresee “an outsized risk of a breakout in inflation.” (Reporting by Tom Polansek, writing by Ann Saphir Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)\n ",
