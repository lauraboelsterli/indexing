    "text": "Achieves Full-Year Profitability\nRecord Yield and Lower Charge-Offs Drive Highest Credit Spread in Three Years\n60+ Delinquency Rate Declines 80 Basis Points Y-O-Y; Second Consecutive Quarter of Y-O-Y Decline\nStrong Retail Operating Margin Supported by Record Retail Gross Margin\nPlatform Built to Support Compelling Retail Growth Opportunity\nTHE WOODLANDS, Texas, April 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Conn's, Inc. (NASDAQ:CONN), a specialty retailer of furniture and mattresses, home appliances, consumer electronics and home office products, and provider of consumer credit, today announced its financial results for the quarter ended January 31, 2018.\n“Conn’s fiscal year 2018 financial results demonstrate the successful execution of the Company’s turnaround strategies and, as expected, a return to full-year profitability. Credit segment performance improved throughout the fiscal year as a result of higher finance charges, stronger portfolio fundamentals, controlled expenses, and lower borrowing costs. Conn’s retail segment ended the year with record retail gross margins. I am encouraged by the platform we have created and the positive momentum underway at Conn’s,” stated Norm Miller, Conn’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, Conn’s credit spread of 560 basis points was the highest level in the past three years driven by both year-over-year improvement in interest income and fee yield and year-over-year reduction in the percentage of bad debt charge-offs. Credit quality has improved as the Company's 60+ delinquency rate declined year-over-year for the second consecutive quarter. Originations continue to benefit from higher yields and enhanced underwriting, and Conn’s credit segment is on a clear path towards even better financial performance as the portfolio seasons.\n“Conn's unmatched value proposition, combining a differentiated credit offering and compelling retail experience, provides the Company with a significant opportunity to profitably grow retail sales and become a national retailer. As we look to fiscal year 2019, we will leverage the successful platform we have built to continue improving our credit spread, while dedicating more of our focus to driving retail growth,” concluded Mr. Miller.\nFourth Quarter Results\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, net income was $3.2 million or $0.10 per diluted share compared to a net loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 of $0.1 million or $0.00 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 was $17.9 million or $0.56 per diluted share, which excludes the impact of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"), costs associated with a facility relocation, and contingency reserves related to legal matters. This compares to adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 of $1.5 million or $0.05 per diluted share, which excludes credits from legal and professional fees associated with securities-related litigation, an adjustment to our indirect tax audit reserve, executive management transition costs and certain non-recurring discrete tax items.\nRetail Segment Fourth Quarter Results\nTotal retail revenues were $334.5 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 compared to $356.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, a decrease of $21.7 million. The 6.1% decrease in retail revenue was primarily driven by a decrease in same store sales of 8.0%, partially offset by new store growth. Sales for the three months ended January 31, 2018 were impacted negatively by the transition of our lease-to-own partner and general consumer softness along the Mexico border. For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, retail segment operating income was $48.6 million. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted retail segment operating income was $50.8 million which excludes costs associated with a facility closure and contingency reserves related to legal matters.\nThe following table presents net sales and changes in net sales by category:\nThree Months Ended January 31, Same Store (dollars in thousands) 2018 % of Total 2017 % of Total Change % Change % Change Furniture and mattress $ 106,967 32.0 % $ 111,289 31.3 % $ (4,322 ) (3.9 )% (5.3 )% Home appliance 84,494 25.3 83,723 23.5 771 0.9 (0.1 ) Consumer electronics 81,966 24.5 96,415 27.1 (14,449 ) (15.0 ) (16.7 ) Home office 25,385 7.6 25,483 7.2 (98 ) (0.4 ) (1.3 ) Other 4,321 1.3 5,018 1.4 (697 ) (13.9 ) (14.8 ) Product sales 303,133 90.7 321,928 90.5 (18,795 ) (5.8 ) (7.2 ) Repair service agreement commissions 27,680 8.2 30,766 8.6 (3,086 ) (10.0 ) (13.9 ) Service revenues 3,648 1.1 3,203 0.9 445 13.9 Total net sales $ 334,461 100.0 % $ 355,897 100.0 % $ (21,436 ) (6.0 )% (8.0 )% The following provides a summary of the items impacting the performance of our product categories during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017:\nFurniture unit volume decreased 11.0%, partially offset by a 9.4% increase in average selling price; Mattress unit volume decreased 18.6%, partially offset by a 6.3% increase in average selling price; Home appliance unit volume decreased 0.3%, partially offset by a 0.1% increase in average selling price; Consumer electronic unit volume decreased 17.1%, partially offset by a 0.5% increase in average selling price; and Home office unit volume decreased 8.1%, partially offset by a 7.4% increase in average selling price.\nCredit Segment Fourth Quarter Results\nCredit revenues were $85.9 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 compared to $76.6 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. The 12.1% increase in credit revenue was primarily the result of increased originations of our higher-yielding direct loan product, which contributed to the increase in the portfolio yield rate to 20.5% from 16.5%, partially offset by the impact of a 2.6% decline in the average balance of the customer receivables portfolio. Credit revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 also reflect a decline in insurance income primarily due to a decrease in retrospective commissions as a result of higher claim volumes related to Hurricane Harvey. The total customer portfolio balance was $1.5 billion at January 31, 2018, compared to $1.6 billion at January 31, 2017, a decrease of 1.8%.\nProvision for bad debts was $54.7 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 compared to $72.1 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, a decrease of $17.4 million. The most significant reasons for the decrease in the provision for bad debts for the three months ended January 31, 2018 compared to the three months ended January 31, 2017 were:\nimprovements in the credit quality of the portfolio for the three months ended January 31, 2018 compared to the three months ended January 31, 2017, resulting in a decrease in our estimated non-TDR loss rate; lower net charge-offs for the three months ended January 31, 2018 compared to the three months ended January 31, 2017;\npartially offset by:\nhigher growth in the customer receivables portfolio balance for the three months ended January 31, 2018 compared to the three months ended January 31, 2017; and an increase in TDR balances in the three months ended January 31, 2018 compared to the three months ended January 31, 2017.\nAdditional information on the credit portfolio and its performance may be found in the Customer Receivable Portfolio Statistics table included within this press release and in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2018, to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nStore Update\nThe Company has opened two new Conn's HomePlus® stores in Texas during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, bringing the total store count to 118 in 14 states. During fiscal year 2019, the Company plans to open between five and nine new stores in existing states to leverage current infrastructure.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of January 31, 2018, the Company had $207.6 million of immediately available borrowing capacity under its $750 million revolving credit facility, with an additional $462.6 million that may become available upon increases in eligible inventory and customer receivable balances under the borrowing base. The Company also had $9.3 million of unrestricted cash available for use.\nOutlook and Guidance\nThe following are the Company's expectations for the business for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019:\nChange in same store sales down 3% to 5%; Retail gross margin between 38.5% and 39.0% of total net retail sales; Selling, general and administrative expenses between 31.5% and 33.0% of total revenues; Provision for bad debts between $43.0 million and $47.0 million; Finance charges and other revenues between $81.0 million and $85.0 million; and Interest expense between $17.5 million and $18.5 million.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will host a conference call on April 5, 2018, at 10 a.m. CT / 11 a.m. ET, to discuss its fourth quarter fiscal year 2018 financial results.

These non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, comparable GAAP measures and should be considered in addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP. They are intended to provide additional insight into our operations and the factors and trends affecting the business. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to financial statement readers because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics we use in our financial and operational decision making, and (2) they are used by some of our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze our operating results.\nSource:Conn's, Inc.",
