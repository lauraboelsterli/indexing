    "text": "SAN MATEO, Calif., April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Franklin Resources, Inc. (the “Company”) (NYSE:BEN) today announced net income 1 of $443.2 million or $0.78 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to a net loss 1 of $583.3 million or $1.06 per diluted share for the previous quarter, and net income 1 of $420.7 million or $0.74 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The net loss 1 for the previous quarter included an estimated income tax charge 2 of $1.1 billion or $1.94 per diluted share resulting from enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\n“The Company’s financial results continue to be strong, and we remain focused on enhancing shareholder value,” said Greg Johnson, Chairman and CEO of Franklin Resources, Inc. “Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were up 5% from the previous year and reached their highest level since the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016. During the quarter, we announced a special cash dividend in the amount of $3.00 per share, in addition to the regular quarterly cash dividend, and we outlined our plans to invest further in the business. The Board of Directors also authorized the Company to repurchase up to an additional 80.0 million shares of its common stock.”\n“Investment performance trends for our U.S. and cross-border mutual funds continue to be mixed, partly a reflection of the value discipline adhered to by much of our equity product offerings. Over the past decade, we’ve witnessed one of the longest periods of growth investing outperformance. However, we feel that given the recent market volatility, a rising interest rate environment, and simply the cyclical nature of growth versus value, our investment teams are well positioned for the inevitable return of value outperformance.”\nQuarter Ended % Change Quarter Ended % Change 31-Mar-18 31-Dec-17 Qtr. vs. Qtr. 31-Mar-17 Year vs. Year Financial Results (in millions, except per share data) Operating revenues $ 1,617.8 $ 1,615.5 0 % $ 1,600.6 1 % Operating income 555.7 581.1 (4 %) 555.5 0 % Operating margin 34.3 % 36.0 % 34.7 % Net income (loss) 1 $ 443.2 $ (583.3 ) NM $ 420.7 5 % Diluted earnings (loss) per share 0.78 (1.06 ) NM 0.74 5 % Assets Under Management (in billions) Ending $ 737.5 $ 753.8 (2 %) $ 740.0 0 % Average 3 751.8 752.7 0 % 731.7 3 % Net flows (10.0 ) (2.3 ) (11.0 ) Total assets under management (“AUM”) were $737.5 billion at March 31, 2018, down $16.3 billion during the quarter due to $10.0 billion of net outflows and $6.3 billion of net market change, distributions and other.\nCash and cash equivalents and investments were $10.1 billion at March 31, 2018, as compared to $9.9 billion at September 30, 2017.

(“Franklin”) and its subsidiaries, which are not historical facts, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this press release, words or phrases generally written in the future tense and/or preceded by words such as “will,” “may,” “could,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “seek,” “estimate” or other similar words are forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors, some of which are listed below, that could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. While forward-looking statements are our best prediction at the time that they are made, you should not rely on them and are cautioned against doing so. Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance.\nThese and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklin’s recent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation, in Risk Factors and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Franklin’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 and Franklin’s subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q:\nVolatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets, and adverse changes in the global economy, may significantly affect our results of operations and may put pressure on our financial results. The amount and mix of our AUM are subject to significant fluctuations. We are subject to extensive, complex, overlapping and frequently changing rules, regulations, policies, and legal interpretations. Global regulatory and legislative actions and reforms have made the regulatory environment in which we operate more costly and future actions and reforms could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Failure to comply with the laws, rules or regulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could result in substantial harm to our reputation and results of operations. Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Any significant limitation, failure or security breach of our information and cyber security infrastructure, software applications, technology or other systems that are critical to our operations could disrupt our business and harm our operations and reputation. Our business operations are complex and a failure to properly perform operational tasks or the misrepresentation of our products and services, or the termination of investment management agreements representing a significant portion of our AUM, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and income. We face risks, and corresponding potential costs and expenses, associated with conducting operations and growing our business in numerous countries. We depend on key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services. Strong competition from numerous and sometimes larger companies with competing offerings and products could limit or reduce sales of our products, potentially resulting in a decline in our market share, revenues and income. Changes in the third-party distribution and sales channels on which we depend could reduce our income and hinder our growth. Our increasing focus on international markets as a source of investments and sales of our products subjects us to increased exchange rate and market-specific political, economic or other risks that may adversely impact our revenues and income generated overseas. Harm to our reputation or poor investment performance of our products could reduce the level of our AUM or affect our sales, and negatively impact our revenues and income. Our future results are dependent upon maintaining an appropriate level of expenses, which is subject to fluctuation. Our ability to successfully manage and grow our business can be impeded by systems and other technological limitations. Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, or legal liability. Regulatory and governmental examinations and/or investigations, litigation and the legal risks associated with our business, could adversely impact our AUM, increase costs and negatively impact our profitability and/or our future financial results. Our ability to meet cash needs depends upon certain factors, including the market value of our assets, operating cash flows and our perceived creditworthiness. We are dependent on the earnings of our subsidiaries.\nAny forward-looking statement made by us in this press release speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\nContact:\nFranklin Resources, Inc.\nInvestor Relations: Brian Sevilla (650) 312-4091\nMedia Relations: Matt Walsh (650) 312-2245\ninvestors.franklinresources.com\nSource:Franklin Resources, Inc.",
