    "text": "LIMA, April 1 (Reuters) - Peru’s consumer price index rose 0.49 percent in March, its biggest increase in 7 months, even as the annual inflation rate slowed to 0.36, state statistics agency Inei said on Sunday.\nThe annual inflation rate was the lowest registered in nine years, the agency said, and well below the central bank’s target range of 1 to 3 percent.\nThe bank has cut the benchmark interest rate several times in the past year amid slowing economic growth.
