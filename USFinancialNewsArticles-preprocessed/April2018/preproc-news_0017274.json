    "text": "IRVINE, Calif., April 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Truesdail Laboratories, a world class independent testing and certification body, has appointed Clif McLellan to lead Truesdail’s Product Certification Division. In this new position, McLellan will have the responsibility to expand the scope of services offered by Truesdail Laboratories while also focusing on growing existing certification to Standard 61 and Standard 372. He will lead business development, marketing, certification, as well as business and strategic planning.\n“Clif brings a wealth of national and international experience in the water product certification industry to Truesdail Laboratories. His experience includes extensive technical expertise as well as successful new program development and business development,” Chief Operating Officer Randy Gates said in making the announcement. Gates added, “He is widely known and respected by manufacturers, regulators and industry organizations worldwide.”\nMcLellan joins Truesdail Laboratories after serving as vice president for the Water Program at NSF International of Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he was responsible for the growth and development of global certifications. He led a number of strategic initiatives, including the development of Standards related to Building Water Health Programs incorporating Standard 453 and Standard 444, and he has a unique understanding of what it takes to meet customer needs.\nFrom 2000 until 2012, McLellan was the Director of Toxicology and led a number of initiatives.

McLellan has worked closely with industry, creating toxicological assessments as new manufacturing methods and products were developed for polyurethanes, PVC and CPVC, Cross-linked polyethylene (PEX), and epoxy resins.\nMcLellan has authored many articles, papers, manuscripts, and industry presentations throughout his career. Additionally, McLellan has conducted research for the U.S. EPA risk assessments for the American Water Works Association, and has helped local water associations better understand drinking water standards. McLellan is very highly regarded within the drinking water industry by academia, industry, and regulatory officials.\nMcLellan is a 1997 graduate of the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor where he earned an M.A. in Toxicology after receiving a B.S. in Chemistry and Biology at Eastern Michigan University.\nUnder McLellan’s leadership, Truesdail will expand its scope of services, focusing on customer service, while utilizing technical and scientific expertise to serve our clients.
