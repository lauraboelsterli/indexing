    "text": "TORONTO, April 11, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Onex Corporation (“Onex”) (TSX:ONEX) announced today it has filed with the Toronto Stock Exchange, and the Exchange has accepted, a Notice of Intention to make a Normal Course Issuer Bid permitting Onex to purchase for cancellation up to 10% of the public float in its Subordinate Voting Shares, or 8,305,710 shares. There are 101,279,777 Subordinate Voting Shares issued and outstanding and the public float as at March 31, 2018 was 83,057,103 shares.\nOnex may buy back shares from time to time during the next twelve months. Any purchases made under the Normal Course Issuer Bid will be effected through the facilities of TSX or alternative Canadian trading systems. The number of shares Onex is permitted to purchase under the bid may be reduced by private acquisitions pursuant to issuer bid exemption orders issued by a securities regulatory authority or otherwise exempt from the issuer bid requirements of applicable law and/or by purchases of shares by certain Onex executives or employees under purchase programs administered by Onex. Any purchases made by way of private agreements under an issuer bid exemption order issued by a securities regulatory authority will be at a discount to the prevailing market price as provided in the exemption order. Onex may purchase up to 32,165 Subordinate Voting Shares during any trading day, being 25% of its average daily trading volume of 128,661 Subordinate Voting Shares for the most recently completed six calendar months. Onex may also purchase Subordinate Voting Shares from time to time under the Exchange's block purchase exemption, if available.\nOnex commenced a similar bid on April 18, 2017. That bid, which permitted the purchase of up to 8,391,231 Subordinate Voting Shares, expires on April 17, 2018. A total of 709,489 shares were purchased under the bid as at April 10, 2018 at an average purchase price of C$93.004 per share. All such purchases occurred through the facilities of the TSX.\nThe Normal Course Issuer Bid is being renewed as it is Onex' view it is advantageous to the company and its shareholders to continue to repurchase Subordinate Voting Shares, from time to time, when they are trading at prices that result in an attractive risk-adjusted return for the continuing shareholders.\nThe Normal Course Issuer Bid will commence on April 18, 2018 and will conclude on the earlier of the date on which purchases under the bid have been completed and April 17, 2019.\nA bout Onex\nOnex is one of the oldest and most successful private equity firms.
