    "text": "BAKU, April 9 (Reuters) - Elman Rustamov, the governor of Azerbaijanâ€™s central bank, said on Monday there was room for further rate cuts after the bank cut its refinancing rate to 11 from 13 percent.\nRustamov told reporters at a briefing that the central bank expected a significant current account surplus by the end of 2018 by which point reserves could rise to $8 billion.\nHe said the current rate of the manat made it possible for the central bank to normalise monetary policy, adding that there was scope to make monetary policy close to neutral by June.
