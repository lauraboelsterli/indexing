    "text": "April 3, 2018 / 10:39 AM / Updated 25 minutes ago Swatch wins ruling to have UK parts case heard in Swiss court Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss watchmaker Swatch Group ( UHR.S ) won a partial victory in a row with a British group over supplying parts to independent repairers when Switzerland’s highest court ruled the case should be heard by a domestic court. The logo of Swiss watchmaker Swatch is pictured on a shop in Geneva, Switzerland, February 9, 2018. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse \nSwatch has been locked in a legal battle with Britain’s Cousins UK which sells watch spare parts to independent repairers and said it stopped receiving supplies from Swatch and its ETA movement unit in late 2015. \nCousins UK had threatened to sue Swatch at the High Court in London to force the resumption of supplies, but Swatch prevented this by starting a procedure to have the case heard by a commercial court in the Swiss capital, Bern. \nThe Bern court had declined to take up the case, saying Swatch had not shown sufficient cause for a local trial, but Switzerland’s Federal Supreme Court ruled in a verdict announced on Tuesday that Swatch had a sufficient interest in having the case heard in Switzerland. \nThe case will now revert to the court in Bern.
