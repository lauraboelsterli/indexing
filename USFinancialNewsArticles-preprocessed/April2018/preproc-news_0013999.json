    "text": "LAS VEGAS, April 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- PlayAGS, Inc. (\"AGS\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: AGS), a leading designer and supplier of electronic gaming machines (\"EGMs\") and other products and services for the gaming industry, today announced it has appointed well-known industry talent Mike McKiski as its Vice President of Sales for Western U.S. and Corporate Accounts. In his new position, McKiski will lead AGS' continued market expansion by partnering with customers to identify incremental revenue opportunities throughout the western half of the United States.\n\"As demand for our consistently high-performing slot products continues to grow, we've strategically developed a best-in-breed sales management team to capitalize on our opportunities,\" said Robert Perry, Senior Vice President of Sales for AGS. \"Recruiting Mike to lead our current team of account executives in the West will help elevate our revenue potential and heighten our strong customer-centric culture as we continue to expand. Between his proven track record as a sales leader and his natural ability to develop new market opportunities, we're confident Mike will add tremendous value to AGS.\"\n\"Joining AGS is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,\" said McKiski. \"I've watched the Company's impressive growth over the past 18 months – including successfully going public earlier this year – and I have been eager to join Team AGS. I'm excited to work for a company that has been named one of 2017's 'Best and Brightest' places to work, earning this honor through a deliberate focus on customer service, employees, and culture. I'm confident that our current product momentum in the marketplace, along with the upcoming library of additional game themes, progressive solutions, and cabinets, will help continue the AGS growth story within both the Corporate and Tribal Gaming markets.\"\nIn his new role, McKiski will focus on bolstering the Company's slot sales strategy to increase revenue growth throughout the Western states including California, Nevada, Arizona, and Washington, to name a few, as well as key corporate accounts within those states. Prior to joining AGS, McKiski was the Vice President of Sales for Western U.S. at Interblock. Before joining Interblock, he served as Director of Sales and Commercial Operations at Scientific Games Interactive. McKiski holds a B.A. from UNLV, where he was a four-year letter winner as an offensive lineman for the Rebels, and he will complete his MBA from Arizona State University's W.P. Carey School of business this Fall.\nAbout AGS\nAGS is a global company focused on creating a diverse mix of entertaining gaming experiences for every kind of player.
