Chris Coons and Cory Booker plan to introduce the legislation Wednesday. The bill would give any special counsel a 10-day window to seek expedited judicial review of a firing. The legislation, which combines two bipartisan bills introduced last summer, signals escalating concerns in Congress as Trump has fumed about an FBI raid of the office of personal attorney Michael Cohen. Published 8 Hours Ago Andrew Burton | Getty Images Robert S. Mueller III \nA bipartisan group of senators is moving to protect special counsel Robert Mueller 's job as President Donald Trump publicly muses about firing him. \nRepublican Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Democrats Chris Coons of Delaware and Cory Booker of New Jersey plan to introduce legislation Wednesday that would give any special counsel a 10-day window to seek expedited judicial review of a firing, according to two people familiar with the legislation. They were not authorized to discuss the bill ahead of its release and requested anonymity. \nThe legislation, which combines two bipartisan bills introduced last summer, signals escalating concerns in Congress as Trump has fumed about a Monday FBI raid of the office of his personal attorney, Michael Cohen. Trump has privately pondered firing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and publicly criticized Mueller and his Russia probe. \nIn addition to investigating potential ties between Russia and the Trump campaign, Mueller is also examining whether the president's actions constitute obstruction of justice. As the investigation has worn on, Trump has repeatedly called it a \"witch hunt.\" On Monday, after the Cohen raid, he said it was \"an attack on our country.\" The raid was overseen by the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan and was based in part on a referral from Mueller, said Cohen's lawyer, Stephen Ryan. \nAfter introducing similar bills in August, when Trump first began criticizing the Mueller probe, both Tillis and Graham had been quiet for months on whether the legislation was still needed as Democrats continued to push for a bill. Both Republicans said they didn't think Trump would really move to fire Mueller. But the senators moved to push out a new, combined bill in the hours after Trump's tirade. \nUnder the legislation, the expedited review would determine whether the special counsel was fired for good cause. The bill would also ensure that any staff, documents and other investigation materials were preserved as the matter was pending. \nIt's unclear if it could ever become law. Such legislation is unlikely to move through the House, and many Republicans in the Senate still expressed confidence Tuesday that Trump would not fire the special counsel. \n\"I don't think he's going to be removed,\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. \"I think he'll be allowed to finish his job.\" \nStill, senators have publicly and privately let the White House know that firing Mueller would be a mistake, said the No. 2 Republican, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas. \n\"There would be serious repercussions,\" said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn. \"I've shared with the president what a massive mistake it would be for him to do this. I've done that in person.\" \nSen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said Tuesday on Fox Business News: \"It would be suicide for the president to want to talk about firing Mueller. The less the president said on this whole thing, the better off he would be, the stronger his presidency would be.\" \nDemocratic leaders have pushed for Republicans to move legislation to protect Mueller. \n\"Stand up and say what the president is doing is wrong,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. \"Make it clear that firing Mueller or interfering in his investigation crosses a red line.\" \nTrump cannot directly fire Mueller. Any dismissal, for cause, would have to be carried out by Rosenstein, who appointed the counsel in May 2017 and has repeatedly expressed support for him. ",
