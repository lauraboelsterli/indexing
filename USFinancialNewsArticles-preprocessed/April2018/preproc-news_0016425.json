Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki meets with First Vice-President of European Commission Frans Timmermans in Warsaw, Poland, April 9, 2018. Agencja Gazeta/Slawomir Kaminski via REUTERS \n“We can see some actions taken by the parliament, we are analysing them very closely and carefully. We haven’t seen an end of this process yet,” he said at a joint news conference with the Polish foreign minister summarising his visit to Warsaw. \n“We will reveal our assessment once ... we have a clear image. I hope it will be positive,” he also said. Reporting by Pawel Sobczak; additional reporting by Pawel Florkiewicz and Anna Wlodarczak-Semczuk; Writing by Marcin Goclowski; Editing by Justyna Pawlak",
