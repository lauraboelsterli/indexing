    "text": "(Adds Alitalia, Hyundai Motor Group, SSE, Bayer)\nApril 26 (Reuters) - The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 2010 GMT on Thursday:\n** Australian hospital operator Healthscope Ltd said it had received a $3.1 billion buyout approach from a new but high-profile domestic private equity firm and its consortium partners just four years after listing.\n** Welltower Inc, a healthcare-focused real estate investment trust, will acquire Quality Care Properties for about $1.95 billion in cash, the companies said late on Wednesday.\n** South Korea’s LG Electronics and holding company LG Corp said they agreed to buy a combined 100 percent stake in Austrian car light maker ZKW Holding GmbH for 1.4 trillion won ($1.3 billion).\n** South Korea’s Lotte Shopping said on Thursday that it has agreed to sell one of its six operators of hypermarket and supermarket stores in China to Wumei Holdings for about 248.5 billion won ($230.2 million).\n** Mexico’s Coca-Cola Femsa, the world’s largest Coke bottler, said on Wednesday a subsidiary had reached a deal to acquire a Guatemala-based Coke bottler and distributor for $124.6 million.\n** British bookshop chain Waterstones is to be acquired by Elliott Advisers, the U.S. activist hedge fund which has made its presence felt in the UK’s corporate world recently by helping force the demerger of Costa Coffee amongst other shake ups.\n** The sale of Italy’s struggling carrier Alitalia has been further delayed because of continued political uncertainty following March’s inconclusive elections, the industry minister said.\n** South Korea’s antitrust chief on Thursday said U.S. activist fund Elliott Management’s proposal for Hyundai Motor Group to adopt a holding company structure was “inappropriate” and, if implemented, would be in violation of antitrust law.\n** Britain’s competition watchdog said the planned merger of SSE’s retail power and gas business in the UK with Npower, owned by German rival Innogy, could lead to higher prices for customers and warrants further scrutiny.\n** Bayer AG said it had agreed to sell more crop science businesses to BASF in a deal that fulfils undertakings to the European Union and other regulators as part of its takeover of Monsanto Co.
