Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland (L) and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer leave after delivering statements at the close of the third round of NAFTA talks involving the United States, Mexico and Canada in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, September 27, 2017. REUTERS/Chris Wattie \n“There are of course a number of other significant issues that still need to be resolved and we look forward to digging into those issues as discussions continue tomorrow,” Freeland said as she left the meeting with Lighthizer in Washington.
