    "text": "April 20, 2018 / 5:29 PM / Updated 14 minutes ago Multiple 'No' votes at Deutsche Bank's April 8 meet to change CEO - sources Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Multiple supervisory board members cast dissenting votes at a meeting that reshuffled top management at Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) earlier this month, according to several people with knowledge of the matter. The headquarters of the Deutsche Bank's DWS Asset Management is pictured in Frankfurt, Germany, March 19, 2018. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski/File Photo \nBoard chairman Paul Achleitner called the bank’s 20-member board to a hastily arranged telephone conference on April 8 to make three major decisions: To vote out former chief executive John Cryan, to vote in Christian Sewing to replace him, and to name two co-deputy CEOs. \nIn each decision, there were several “no” votes cast, said the sources on Friday. Both employee representatives on the board as well as investor representatives on the board cast dissenting votes, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \nIn the end, however, Christian Sewing was chosen as the bank’s new CEO, amid frustration over continuing losses at the German lender and a sagging share price. \nA spokesman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment.
