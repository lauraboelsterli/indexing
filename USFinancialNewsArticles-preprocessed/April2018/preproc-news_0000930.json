U.S. President Donald Trump addresses a joint news conference with Baltic leaders at the White House in Washington, U.S., April 3, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque \n“The leaders discussed Iran’s increasingly reckless behaviour in the region and the threat it poses to regional stability,” the White House said in a statement. Trump emphasized to the emir “that it is critical to end the Gulf dispute,” it said. \nThe White House said Trump spoke on Monday with King Salman of Saudi Arabia about the split in the Gulf Cooperation Council, as well as other regional issues, including Syria and Yemen.
