    "text": "RIYADH (Reuters) - Kuwait’s Crown Prince Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Sabah left the United States following medical tests on Friday, state news agency KUNA reported.\nThe crown prince went to New York for “routine” medical check-ups 10 days ago, KUNA reported. He also went to the United States for medical check-ups last August.\nSheikh Nawaf, 80-year-old brother of the small Gulf Arab state’s ruler, underwent minor back surgery in 2013 in Germany. A relatively low-profile figure, he became next in line to lead the U.S.-allied oil exporter in 2006, shortly after Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah became ruling emir.\nThe health of leading members of the ruling family is a sensitive issue in Kuwait, where less senior al-Sabah members have long been jostling for position, according to diplomats and analysts. It is not public knowledge who is third in line in Kuwait, an OPEC member state.\nWriting by Sarah Dadouch; Editing by Alison Williams\n ",
