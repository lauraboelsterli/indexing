Garrett and Paul Woodward to its Board of Directors.\nDr. Garrett is a Principal of John Garrett & Partners with a practice focusing on early stage US and international biomedical companies as well as corporate initiatives in the domains of software, and communication companies. Since 2004, Dr. Garrett has led five startup companies in CEO/COO positions, including initiatives with partners emanating from Harvard University and Roswell Park Cancer Center. Currently, he is co-CEO of Glycosyn, Inc., centered on treating/curing common childhood diseases, and the Executive Director of Glycosyn Health Initiatives, devoted to bringing life-saving treatments to children in the developing world.\nPaul Woodward is currently President of Conation Capital Corp., and has been a frequent investor in early stage private companies.

Paul Woodward has been a strong supporter of APC. His extensive experience in capital markets and corporate finance will be a major asset to the Company going forward.”\nABOUT THE COMPANY:\nAdvanced Proteome Therapeutics Corporation is developing a proprietary technology to directly target cancerous tumors and avoid destroying normal cells. This type of agent is capable of greater potency, higher specificity, and lower toxicity than other therapies that can also attack healthy cells. Advanced Proteome is working to streamline the process by which these agents are prepared, which to date, has been extremely cumbersome, limiting their potential. www.advancedproteome.com\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT:\nAdvanced Proteome Therapeutics Corporation\nAllen Krantz, Ph.D.\nChief Operating and Chief Scientific Officer\nTel: 617 638 0340\nhttp://www.advancedproteome.com\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nThis communication contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the Company’s business, which can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \"estimates\", \"believes\", \"expects\", \"may\", \"will”, \"should”, \"future\", \"potential\" or similar expressions or by a general discussion of the Company’s strategies, plans or intentions.
