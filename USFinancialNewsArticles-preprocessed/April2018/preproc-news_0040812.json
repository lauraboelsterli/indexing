FILE PHOTO - A European Union flag flies from a lamp post opposite the Houses of Parliament in London, Britain, January 16, 2018. REUTERS/Hannah McKay \nIn a joint statement, the two countries said the working group would be a forum for the two treasury departments and staff at regulatory authorities to exchange views on the future relationship. \nBoth sides said the working group would meet twice a year, with additional technical meetings and calls when needed.
