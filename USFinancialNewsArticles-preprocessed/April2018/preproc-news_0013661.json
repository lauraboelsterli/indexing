    "text": "  Updated 7 minutes ago War crimes prosecutor seeks jurisdiction over Rohingya deportations Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nAMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) has asked it to rule on whether it had jurisdiction over the deportations of Rohingya people from Myanmar to Bangladesh, a possible war crime, according to a filing published on Monday. FILE PHOTO: Rohingya refugees build shelter with bamboo at the Jamtoli camp in the morning in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, January 22, 2018. REUTERS/Mohammad Ponir Hossain/File Photo \nProsecutor Fatou Bensouda said in the filing that doubt over jurisidiction arises because Bangladesh is a member of the court but Myanmar is not. \nBensouda argued that, given the cross-border nature of the crime of deportation, a ruling in favor of ICC jurisdiction would be in line with established principles of criminal law.
