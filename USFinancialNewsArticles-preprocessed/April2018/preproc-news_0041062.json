    "text": "(Reuters) - Photo management platform SmugMug said on Friday it has agreed to buy image and video-hosting website Flickr for an undisclosed amount.\nFlickr will continue to operate as a separate entity after the deal closes, SmugMug said.\n“Uniting the SmugMug and Flickr brands will make the whole photography community stronger and better connected,” SmugMug Chief Executive Don MacAskill said in a statement. “Together, we can preserve photography as the global language of storytelling.”\nVerizon bought Yahoo Inc’s core business for $4.48 billion last year and the acquisition included Flickr, among other web properties.\nReporting by Rishika Chatterjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ",
