    "text": "(Adds details, Quote: s)\nMOSCOW, Russia’s largest steelmaker NLMK said on Tuesday its core earnings rose 31 percent year-on-year in the first quarter to a 10-year high, beating analysts’ expectations, due in large part to operational efficiency gains.\nCore earnings of $812 million exceeded analysts’ forecasts for $784 million and rose from $618 million a year earlier.\nNLMK, controlled by billionaire Vladimir Lisin, said first quarter revenue fell 1 percent on a quarterly basis to $2.8 billion due to a seasonal drop in sales.\nHowever, this was offset by price increases. Year-on-year, revenue increased 30 percent, from $2.2 billion in the first quarter of 2017.\n“The widening of steel product/raw material price spreads, gains from completed capex projects, and operational efficiency gains were the key drivers behind the growth of EBITDA to a 10-year high,” acting CFO Sergey Karataev said in a statement.\n“A significant liquidity cushion and a strong balance (sheet) create favourable conditions for high dividend payments,” he added.\nNLMK’s shares were up 0.6 percent at 154.89 in Moscow by 0833 GMT.\nIn March, NLMK’s board recommended a fourth-quarter dividend payout of 3.36 roubles ($0.0590) per share.\nNLMK said first quarter net profit totalled $502 million, up 56 percent from $323 million in the same period last year.
