The 1933 law legalized the buying, selling and drinking of beer and wine for the first times since Prohibition took over the U.S. in 1920. Prohibition of all alcohol officially came to an end with the ratification of the 21st Amendment, but Roosevelt‚Äôs signature nearly eight decades ago still carries weight today. \nWhile many major chains like Applebee‚Äôs don‚Äôt have any beer-day specific deals, many local bars and smaller chains are celebrating Here are five of the best beer deals for National Beer Day 2018 .
