Mr. Clausen will complete his current obligations, including the closing of the acquisition of Brio Gold Inc., prior to joining Copper Mountain. Mr. O'Rourke will remain as non-executive Chairman and Director of the Company.\nMr. Clausen is a mining executive with more than 30 years experience in the areas of management, finance, development and operations in the base and precious metals industry.

His proven leadership skills and track record of value creation will unquestionably be an asset to the Company as we launch into our new phase of growth.\"\nAbout Copper Mountain Mining Corporation:\nCopper Mountain's flagship asset is the 75% owned Copper Mountain mine located in southern British Columbia near the town of Princeton. The Copper Mountain mine produces about 100 million pounds of copper equivalent per year with a large resource that remains open laterally and at depth. This significant exploration potential will be explored over the next few years in order to fully appreciate the property's full development potential. Recently, Copper Mountain shareholders approved the acquisition of Altona Mining Limited which brings significant growth potential with the development-ready Eva Copper (Cloncurry) Project and a massive exploration potential in the ~ 4,000 square km (379,000 hectare) mineralized land package all within the highly prospective Mt. Isa area in Queensland, Australia.\nAdditional information is available on the Company's web page at www.CuMtn.com .\nOn behalf of the Board of\nCOPPER MOUNTAIN MINING CORPORATION\n\"Jim O'Rourke\"\nJim O'Rourke, P.Eng.\nChief Executive Officer\nNote: This release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
