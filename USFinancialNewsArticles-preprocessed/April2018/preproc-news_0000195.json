    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Yukon Partners (\"Yukon\"), a provider of mezzanine capital for middle market private equity transactions, is pleased to announce it has partnered with Sorenson Capital (“Sorenson”) and Webster Capital (“Webster”) in the recapitalization of their shared portfolio company, Home Brands Group Holdings, Inc.
