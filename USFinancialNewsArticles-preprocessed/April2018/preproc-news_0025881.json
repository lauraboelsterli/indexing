Earnings at the S&P 500 companies are estimated to grow by 18.4 percent from a year earlier.\nBy 7:02 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 69 points, or 0.28 percent, S&P 500 e-minis rose 8.25 points, or 0.31 percent, Nasdaq 100 e-minis gained 8.5 points, or 0.13 percent.\nStocks got a boost on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump cast doubt over the timing of his threatened strike on Syria, easing the risk of clashes between Western powers and Russia in Syria over an alleged chemical attack.\nTalks of the United States re-opening negotiations with the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), a multinational trade deal the Trump administration walked away from last year, also helped sentiment.\nBut he later tweeted that the United States would only join the TPP if the deal were substantially better than the one offered to former President Barack Obama.\nAmong other stocks, Starbucks shares fell 1.3 percent after brokerage Cowen and Co downgraded the stock to “market perform”.\nReporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila\n ",
