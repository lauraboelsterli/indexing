The firm left the OPEC nation after it could not reach a deal to convert its projects into joint ventures controlled by PDVSA.\nThe ICC has no means of enforcing its decisions though Conoco considers this award as the first step in a series of legal actions to receive compensation for the expropriation.\nConoco had sought up to $22 billion from PDVSA for broken contracts and loss of future profits from the Hamaca and Petrozuata oil projects. The agreements with PDVSA contained price formulas that limited the compensation Conoco could claim.\nA separate arbitration case by Conoco against Venezuela before the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes introduced in 2007 could issue a final decision later this year, a lawyer close to the case said.
