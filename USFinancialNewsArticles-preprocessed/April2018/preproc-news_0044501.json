    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - Air France ( AIRF.PA ) unions said they would continue strike action into May, in addition to two further days in April, in a dispute over pay that has already cost the French carrier hundreds of millions of euros.\nThe unions representing pilots, cabin crew and ground staff plan to go on strike on April 23 and 24, continuing a series of walkouts since the end of February, and said they would update members on new strike dates next week.\nUnions are calling for a 6 percent pay increase for this year for Air France staff.\nManagement has proposed a draft agreement that runs for several years, including a pay increase of 2 percent for 2018. That draft agreement, which also contains a general wage increase of 5 percent over the 2019-2021 period, is open for signatures until Friday.\nSo far, the walkouts have cost parent group Air France-KLM 220 million euros ($272 million).\n“Each further day of strikes worsens the financial situation of Air France, affects customer confidence and increases the pressure on those staff not striking,” Air France said in a statement.\nReporting by Cyril Altmeyer, writing by Victoria Bryan; editing by David Evans\n ",
