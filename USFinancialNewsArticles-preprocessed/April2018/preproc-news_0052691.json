    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump may meet with South Korea’s president before his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to seek a denuclearization deal, a White House official said on Wednesday.\nFILE PHOTO: South Korea's President Moon Jae-in is seen during a meeting with Vietnam's Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc (not pictured) at the Government Office in Hanoi, Vietnam March 23, 2018. REUTERS/Kham/Pool South Korean President Moon Jae-in is due to meet with Kim on Friday, and Trump has said he could have talks with the North Korean leader in late May or June.\nWhite House national security adviser John Bolton spoke with his South Korean counterpart, Chung Eui-yong, on Wednesday and they discussed “looking into a meeting between the two presidents that would take place before the United States-North Korea summit,” the official said.\nThe United States is pressing North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons and says it will keep up a policy of “maximum pressure” on Pyongyang through sanctions to achieve that goal.\nMoon said last week that North Korea had expressed a commitment to “complete denuclearization” of the Korean peninsula, and Pyongyang said on Saturday it would immediately suspend nuclear and missile tests.\nReporting by Steve Holland; Writing by Eric Beech; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ",
