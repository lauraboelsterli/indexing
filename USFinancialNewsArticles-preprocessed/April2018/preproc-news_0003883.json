    "text": "(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc is in talks with Procter & Gamble Co for a sale of the largest U.S. drugmakerâ€™s consumer health business, CNBC reported on Tuesday, citing sources.\nThe Pfizer logo is seen at their world headquarters in Manhattan, New York, U.S., August 1, 2016. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly The companies were far apart on a price for the business and Pfizer is considering other options, including a joint venture with other drugmakers, the report said.\nPfizer said it is evaluating potential strategic options for the unit and expects to make a decision in 2018.\nGlaxoSmithKline, Reckitt Benckiser and Johnson & Johnson have all exited from the bidding process, endangering an auction Pfizer hoped would bring in as much as $20 billion\nP&G said it declined to comment.\nReporting by Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila\n ",
