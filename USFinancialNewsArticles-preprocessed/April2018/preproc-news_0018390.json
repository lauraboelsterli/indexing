    "text": "April 10, 2018 / 12:42 PM / Updated 35 minutes ago Sri Lankan shares pull away from 11-week closing low Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nCOLOMBO, April 10 (Reuters) - Sri Lankan shares on Monday recovered from their lowest close in 11 weeks in thin trade ahead of the Sinhala-Tamil New Year this week, brokers said. \nThe Colombo stock index ended 0.14 percent higher at 6,439.83, recovering from its lowest close since Jan. 23 hit in the previous session. \nThe turnover stood at 499.1 million rupees ($3.21 million), less than half of this year’s daily average of 1.18 billion rupees. \nMarket sentiment has improved after Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe survived a no-confidence motion last week, dealers said. \n“But still, the market is waiting for some more clarity in the political front. The holidays are also weighing on the trading,” said Prashan Fernando, CEO, Acuity Stockbrokers. \nTop listed lender Commercial Bank of Ceylon gained 1.1 percent, Capital Trust closed 3.7 percent up, while John Keells Holdings edged up 0.1 percent. \nForeign investors sold shares worth net 43.4 million rupees on Tuesday, extending the net foreign outflow to 831.7 million rupees from equities. \nDealers expect the stock market to be tepid this week ahead of the Sinhala-Tamil New Year on April 14. \nThe central bank unexpectedly cut its key lending rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday, as policy makers sought to revitalise an economy growing at its weakest pace in 16 years and facing heightened political uncertainty. \nThe index fell 0.33 percent last week and dropped 1.14 percent in March.
