    "text": "PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- EQT Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE: EQM), EQT GP Holdings, LP (NYSE: EQGP), and Rice Midstream Partners LP (NYSE: RMP), today, announced a midstream streamlining transaction that includes:\nEQM’s acquisition of EQT Corporation’s (NYSE: EQT) retained midstream assets and Gulfport Energy’s (NYSE: GPOR) 25% ownership in the Strike Force Gathering System for $1.69 billion. EQT will receive $1.15 billion in cash and 5.9 million EQM common units and Gulfport Energy will receive $175 million in cash. The merger of EQM and RMP in a unit-for-unit transaction at an exchange ratio of 0.3319x, which implies a transaction value of $2.4 billion, including the assumption of RMP debt. The RMP debt balance as of March 31, 2018 was $325 million. EQGP’s purchase of RMP’s Incentive Distribution Rights (RMP IDRs) from EQT for 36.3 million EQGP common units.\nThis streamlining transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to both EQM and EQGP’s distributable cash flow per unit.\nTransaction Details\nEQM has entered into a definitive agreement with EQT to acquire its Olympus Gathering System and its 75% interest in the Strike Force Gathering System. EQM has also entered into a definitive agreement with Gulfport Energy to acquire its 25% interest in the Strike Force Gathering System. EQT will receive $1.15 billion in cash and 5.9 million EQM common units and Gulfport Energy will receive $175 million in cash. Additional details regarding the Olympus Gathering System and the Strike Force Gathering System (Ohio Gathering Assets), including an adjusted EBITDA forecast, are provided below. The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018.\nEQM and RMP have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which EQM will acquire RMP in a unit-for-unit transaction. Each holder of a common unit of RMP will receive 0.3319 units of EQM, representing a 10% premium to RMP and an equity value of $2.1 billion based on the closing RMP and EQM unit prices on April 25, 2018. EQM will also assume RMP debt, which totaled $325 million as of March 31, 2018. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions and the closing of the RMP IDRs purchase.\nThe merger of EQM and RMP creates significant operational efficiencies through the optimized buildout of gathering and header pipeline systems to service the combined EQT and legacy Rice Energy acreage footprint. The efficiency gains are expected to result in approximately $500 million of capital avoidance, while achieving the same level of gathered volume growth during the next five years. In addition to the capital synergies, EQM expects to realize savings of approximately $15 million per year in operating and maintenance expense and selling, general and administrative expense.\nEQGP has entered into a definitive agreement with EQT to acquire its ownership of the RMP IDRs for 36.3 million EQGP common units, which represents $937 million based on the April 25, 2018 EQGP closing unit price. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018. In the event that the EQM/RMP merger is not completed, 8.5 million EQGP common units that had been issued as consideration would be cancelled and EQT would pay EQGP the aggregate amount of any distributions received from EQGP related to the cancelled units in cash.\nOhio Gathering Assets\nThe Ohio Gathering Assets consist of two dry natural gas gathering systems, known as Olympus and Strike Force. The Ohio Gathering Assets were designed and constructed to gather natural gas in the Utica shale in eastern Ohio, primarily in Belmont and Monroe Counties.\nOlympus gathering\n68,000 acres dedicated to system 1.0 Bcf per day average gathered volume in Q1 2018 85 miles of natural gas gathering pipeline 15,000 horsepower compression Multiple interstate pipeline connections (TETCO, REX, DEO)\nStrike Force gathering\n5-year minimum volume commitment from Gulfport 98,000 acres dedicated to system 0.9 Bcf per day average gathered volume in Q1 2018 67 miles of natural gas gathering pipeline 17,000 horsepower compression Multiple interstate pipeline interconnects (TETCO, ET Ohio River, Rover, LXP)\nOhio Gathering Assets Projections\n2018* 2019 2020 Gathered Volume (Bcf/day) 1.8 – 2.0 2.0 – 2.2 2.2 – 2.4 Adjusted EBITDA ($MM) $165 - $175 $245 - $255 $255 - $265 Expansion Capex ($MM) $210 $180 $90 *Reflects full-year. EQM acquisition of the Ohio Gathering Assets is expected to be effective May 1, 2018.\nSee the Non-GAAP Disclosures section of this news release for important disclosures regarding projected adjusted EBITDA and projected distributable cash flow.\nEQM Financing\nEQM has entered into a $2.5 billion 364-day syndicated term loan facility. EQM expects to borrow under the term loan facility to finance the cash consideration of the Ohio Gathering Assets acquisition, 2018 expansion capital expenditures, and Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP) capital contributions. EQM expects to access the public debt markets over the coming months to retire amounts outstanding under the term loan facility and to fund expansion capital expenditures and MVP capital contributions.\nBased on the strength of EQM’s credit metrics and the current organic growth project backlog, EQM is not forecasting any additional public equity issuance at least through 2020.\nPro-forma Projections\nThe projections below assume a May 1, 2018 effective date for the Ohio Gathering Asset acquisition and a September 1, 2018 closing date for the EQM/RMP merger.\nEQM pro-forma:\nFive-year organic growth capital backlog of approximately $4.8 billion Long-term target of 3.5x debt to EBITDA, which is an investment grade metric 1.1x - 1.2x target distribution coverage ratio Annual distribution per unit growth of 15% to 20% for several years\n2018 2019 2020 EQM Net Income ($B) $0.70 - $0.80 $0.95 - $1.05 $1.00 - $1.10 Adjusted EBITDA ($B) $0.90 - $1.00 $1.40 - $1.50 $1.55 - $1.65 Distributable Cash Flow ($B) $0.75 - $0.85 $1.15 - $1.25 $1.25 - $1.35 Distribution per unit (using midpoint of guidance)* $4.50 $5.29 $6.21 Expansion Capex + MVP capital contributions ($B) $1.6 - $1.8 $0.9 - $1.1 $0.5 - $0.7 EQGP Distribution per unit* $1.21 $1.67 $2.09 Distribution per unit year-over-year growth* 39% 38% 25% *Based on midpoint of 15% - 20% year-over-year distribution growth rate guidance for EQM.\nApprovals\nThe boards of directors of EQT and each of EQGP, EQM and RMP, as well as the conflicts committees of EQGP, EQM and RMP, have unanimously approved these transactions.

As used in this news release, distributable cash flow means EQM adjusted EBITDA less net interest expense excluding interest income on the Preferred Interest, capitalized interest and AFUDC - debt, and ongoing maintenance capital expenditures net of expected reimbursements. Distributable cash flow should not be viewed as indicative of the actual amount of cash that EQM has available for distributions from operating surplus or that EQM plans to distribute. Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures that management and external users of EQM’s consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, use to assess:\nEQM’s operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry without regard to historical cost basis or, in the case of adjusted EBITDA, financing methods; the ability of EQM’s assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to EQM unitholders; EQM’s ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.\nEQM believes that adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow provide useful information to investors in assessing EQM’s results of operations and financial condition. Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow should not be considered as alternatives to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Additionally, because adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow may be defined differently by other companies in its industry, EQM’s definition of adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing the utility of the measures.\nEQM is unable to project net cash provided by operating activities or provide the related reconciliation between projected distributable cash flow and projected net cash provided by operating activities, the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, because net cash provided by operating activities includes the impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities. Changes in operating assets and liabilities relate to the timing of EQM’s cash receipts and disbursements that may not relate to the period in which the operating activities occurred, and EQM is unable to project these timing differences with any reasonable degree of accuracy to a specific day, three or more months in advance. EQM is also unable to provide a reconciliation of its projected EBITDA to projected net income, the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, because EQM does not provide guidance with respect to the intra-year timing of its or the Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC’s capital spending, which impact AFUDC-debt and equity and equity earnings, among other items, that are reconciling items between adjusted EBITDA and net income. The timing of capital expenditures is volatile as it depends on weather, regulatory approvals, contractor availability, system performance and various other items. EQM provides a range for the forecasts of net income, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow to allow for the variability in the timing of cash receipts and disbursements, capital spending and the impact on the related reconciling items, many of which interplay with each other. Therefore, the reconciliations of projected distributable cash flow and adjusted EBITDA to projected net cash provided by operating activities and net income are not available without unreasonable effort.\nEQT’s Retained Midstream Assets Adjusted EBITDA\nEQT’s Retained Midstream Assets EBITDA means the earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation of EQT’s retained midstream assets. EBITDA of these assets is a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure that management and external users of EQM’s consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, use to assess the impact of the potential sale of the retained midstream assets from EQT to EQM through one or more drop-down transactions on EQM’s future results of operations.\nEQM believes that the projected EBITDA of the retained midstream assets provides useful information to investors in assessing the impact of the potential drop-down transactions on EQM’s future results of operations. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income. Additionally, because EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in EQM’s industry, the definition of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing the utility of the measure.\nEQM has not provided projected net income from the retained midstream assets, the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, or a reconciliation of projected EBITDA to projected net income of the assets. The retained midstream assets are operated as part of EQT’s Production business segment, and EQT does not allocate certain costs, such as interest and tax expenses, to individual assets within its business segments. Therefore, the projected net income of the retained midstream assets and a reconciliation of projected EBITDA of the assets to projected net income from those assets are not available without unreasonable effort.\nCautionary Statements\nDisclosures in this news release contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
