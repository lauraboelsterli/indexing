    "text": "By Chris Morris 10:52 AM EDT \nWaffle House is an icon throughout the Southeast, dotting interstate exits seemingly wherever you go and a favorite of barflys after last call. It’s a moment frozen in time — but Waffle House’s newest location is making one of the biggest changes in the company’s history. \nFor the first time, Waffle House diners will be able to get a beer with their meal. The location, which opened in Atlanta’s SunTrust Park (home of the Atlanta Braves) earlier this week, features a reduced menu (you’re going to want to be a big fan of hashbrowns as it’s your only choice) along with Miller Light and Coors Light. \nAs of now, there are no plans to roll out alcoholic menu items to Waffle House’s other 400 locations, though officials will likely be keeping an eye on their popularity. Given that so many Waffle Houses are located at or near highway exits, adding booze to the menu might be a bad idea. \nWhile it might not be the best food in town, Waffle House has built a cult following in its 63 year history. Some patrons have gotten married at the diner. It once acted as a drop off point for a package delivery service . And during last year’s solar eclipse, it was a gathering spot for thousands of people. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
