    "text": "April 18, 2018 / 11:08 AM / Updated 9 hours ago Four U.S. senators seek details on unusual cellular surveillance in D.C. area David Shepardson 3   Four U.S. senators on Wednesday urged the U.S. Homeland Security Department (DHS) to disclose additional information about unusual cellular surveillance activity that has been detected around the nation’s capital. The Washington Monument stands in Washington, D.C., U.S., September 11, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts \nThe senators - Ron Wyden and Ed Markey, both Democrats, and Republicans Rand Paul and Cory Gardner - said the Trump administration should make public additional details about possible surveillance using cellphone-site simulators around Washington. \n“The American people have a legitimate interest in understanding the extent to which U.S. telephone networks are vulnerable to surveillance and are being actively exploited by hostile actors,” the four said in a letter reviewed by Reuters. \nHomeland Security did not immediately comment, but said in a March 26 letter to Wyden that DHS “has observed anomalous activity in the National Capital Region that appears to be consistent with International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) catchers. (DHS) has not validated or attributed such activity to specific entities or devices”. \nThe senators’ letter also said that DHS had briefed federal agencies in February about the issue but has not made details of the briefings public. \nFederal Communications Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, on Tuesday said at a commission meeting the issue was serious and surveillance tools could potentially be in use “by foreign or criminal actors”. \nShe warned “these surveillance tools can transform cell phones into real-time tracking devices by mimicking legitimate cell towers and some may even have the technical capability to record the content of calls”. \nRosenworcel added “the security of our communications is at stake right here, right now in Washington and this agency owes the public more than silence”. \nIf accurate, she said, “someone needs to explain how foreign actors are transmitting over our airwaves without approval from this agency”. \nThis month, three senior U.S. House Democrats asked FCC chairman Ajit Pai to take immediate action to address what could be foreign governments’“surveilling Americans in the nation’s capital”. \nThe FCC only allows the devices, which are commonly known as “stingrays,” to be used by U.S. law enforcement agencies. \nThe devices can trick suspects’ cell phones into revealing their locations. \nThey mimic cell phone towers in order to force cell phones in the area to transmit “pings” back to the devices, enabling law enforcement to track a suspect’s phone and pinpoint its location.
