REUTERS/Francisco Proer Lula was surrounded by hundreds of diehard supporters, including leaders of his Workers Party, union workers and activists, in the industrial suburb of Sao Paulo where his political career began as a union official. He will be taken by police to a jail cell in the southern city of Curitiba, where he will begin serving his 12-year sentence.\nReporting by Tatiana Ramil; Additional reporting and writing by Jake Spring; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ",
