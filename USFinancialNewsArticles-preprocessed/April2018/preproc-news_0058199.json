    "text": "HAYWARD, Calif., April 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: UCTT), a leading developer and supplier of critical subsystems for the semiconductor and display capital equipment industries, today reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 30, 2018.\n\"UCT delivered excellent results on the top and bottom line, driven by extraordinary demand as well as new products ramping faster than expected,\" said Jim Scholhamer, President and CEO. \"Our performance was accentuated by our ability to quickly deliver quality products on short notice, proving our customers are increasingly relying on UCT as a partner to further their success. Continued strength in the semiconductor capital equipment market, together with our elevated focus on growth opportunities, serves to heighten our excitement about the prospects for UCT.\"\nGAAP Financial Results\nTotal revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $314.8 million, an increase of 26.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and 53.9% compared to the same period a year ago. Semiconductor revenue increased 27.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and 57.0% compared to the same period a year ago. Total revenue from outside the U.S. rose 29.8% sequentially and 70.9% compared to the same period a year ago. Gross margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 15.5% compared to 17.7% for the prior quarter and 18.3% for the same period a year ago. Net income for the first quarter was $24.7 million, or $0.67 and $0.66 per basic and diluted share compared to net income of $20.8 million, or $0.62 and $0.60 per basic and diluted share in the previous quarter, and net income of $14.3 million, or $0.43 and $0.42 per basic and diluted share for the same period a year ago.\nNet cash for the first quarter 2018 increased $91.6 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Cash and cash equivalents were $162.4 million, an increase of $94.1 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the financing in February, 2018.\nNon- GAAP Financial Results\nNon-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $25.7 million, or $0.69 per diluted share based on 37.5 million weighted shares outstanding. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share exclude pre-tax charges of $1.1 million for intangible assets amortization, $0.9 million of costs related to the closure of the Company's machining operations in China and $0.1 million related to the Company's expansion of its operations in Singapore, offset by the corresponding increase in tax expense from these items of approximately $1.1 million. This compares to fourth quarter non-GAAP net income of $20.3 million and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.59 based on 34.5 million weighted shares outstanding, and non-GAAP net income of $15.9 million and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.47 based on 33.9 million weighted shares outstanding for the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Company has provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in the financial statement tables included in this press release.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Outlook\nThe Company expects revenue to be between $280.0 million to $300.0 million and GAAP diluted net income per share to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.59. The Company expects non-GAAP net income per diluted share to be in the range of $0.52 to $0.62.\nConference Call\nUCT will conduct a conference call today, Wednesday, April 25, 2018, beginning at 1:45 p.m. PDT.\nThe call-in number is (844) 826-3034 (domestic) and (412) 317-5179 (international). A replay of the conference will be available for seven days following the call at (877) 344-7529 (domestic) and (412) 317-0088 (international). The confirmation number for live broadcast and replay is 10119334 (all callers).\nAbout Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc.\nUltra Clean Holdings, Inc. is a leading developer and supplier of critical subsystems for the semiconductor and display capital equipment industries.

Additional information is available at www.uct.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nManagement uses non-GAAP net income and net income per diluted share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. We believe the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing our core business and business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing investors' ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Tables presenting reconciliations of non-GAAP results to U.S. GAAP results are included at the end of this press release. A reconciliation of our guidance for non-GAAP net income per diluted share for the second quarter of 2018 is not available due to fluctuations in the geographic mix of our earnings from quarter to quarter, which impacts our tax rate and cannot be reasonably predicted or determined. As a result, such reconciliation is not available without unreasonable efforts and we are unable to determine the probable significance of the unavailable information.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThe foregoing information contains, or may be deemed to contain, \"forward-looking statements\" (as defined in the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. We use words such as \"anticipates,\", \"projection\", \"outlook\", \"forecast\", \"believes,\" \"plan,\" \"expect,\" \"future,\"' \"intends,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"estimates,\" \"predicts,\" and similar expressions to identify these forward-looking statements.
