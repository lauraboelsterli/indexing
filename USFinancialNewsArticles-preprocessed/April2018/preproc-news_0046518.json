    "text": "PARIS, French industrial morale weakened slightly in April compared to the previous month, data from state statistics body INSEE showed on Tuesday.\nMorale in the industrial sector fell to 109 points in April, down from a revised figure of 110 points for March, although INSEE said it remained above its long-term average level of 100 points.\nA Reuters poll of 18 economists had given an average forecast of 110 points for the April industrial morale figure.\nSurveys measuring French economic and business morale have hit multi-year highs since President Emmanuel Macron’s election last year.\nData this week also showed that the French economy had been relatively resilient in the face of rolling strikes by railway workers who are protesting against Macron’s reform of state-owned rail company SNCF.\nFor details from INSEE: here\nFor a graphic: reut.rs/2DErm7G\nReporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Laurence Frost\n ",
