    "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Monday it was “patient but prepared” ahead of a U.S. decision on whether to impose import tariffs on steel and aluminum coming from the bloc.\nThe European Union, along with other countries such as Canada and Mexico, were granted temporary exemptions from the tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum applied from March. Those exemptions expire on May 1.\n“The only thing that I can tell you today is that we are patient but we are also prepared,” Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas told a news conference.\nReporting by Philip Blenkinsop; editing by Robert-Jan Bartunek\n ",
