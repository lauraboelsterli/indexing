    "text": "\"Sleeping on the factory floor, doing — why are you doing that?\" King asked. \n\"Because I don't have time to go home and shower,\" Musk responded. \n\"I don't believe like people should be experiencing hardship while the CEO is, like, off on vacation,\" Musk told King. \nThe hands on approach is all part of Musk's leadership style. \nEarlier in April, Musk said he would handle direct oversight of Model 3 production. \"My job as CEO is to focus on what's most critical, which is currently Model 3 production,\" tweeted Musk. About a year ago, I asked Doug to manage both engineering & production. He agreed that Tesla needed eng & prod better aligned, so we don't design cars that are crazy hard to build. Right now, tho, better to divide & conquer, so I'm back to sleeping at factory. Car biz is hell … \nMusk has talked about leading from the front lines before. \nIn November, Musk hosted the company's quarterly investor call from the Gigafactory, Tesla's battery production facility in Nevada, because he'd been there, working day and night to correct production delays, he said. \n\"I always move my desk to wherever — well, I don't really have a desk, actually. I move myself to wherever the biggest problem is in Tesla,\" said Musk in November. \"I really believe that one should lead from the front lines and that's why I'm here.\" \nMusk said he had been at the factory at all hours. \n\"I am personally on that line, in that machine, trying to solve problems personally where I can,\" Musk said at the time. \"We are working seven days a week to do it. And I have personally been here on zone 2 module line at 2:00 a.m. on a Sunday morning, helping diagnose robot calibration issues. So I'm doing everything I can.\" \nSee also:",
