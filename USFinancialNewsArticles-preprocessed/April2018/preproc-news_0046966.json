    "text": "17 COMMENTS When specialty designer Linda London mapped out the interiors of her client’s 18,000-square-foot, seven-bedroom contemporary home in Greenwich, Conn., she focused on two things: function and beauty.\n“She is very organized and very stylish,” Ms. London said about her client, a mother and grandmother whose husband works in finance and who loves to entertain. Their weekend compound regularly hosts the entire extended family as well as many friends, and has a multitude of areas in which to congregate: terraces, the pool, the beach, the 400-square-foot kitchen and an adjoining breakfast nook. Those areas hold more than 25 cabinets in all.\nEach area has custom cabinets to store contrasting and complementary sets of dishes, glassware, linens and flatware, which is as attractive as it is effective. “You can set up a buffet for 25 people in seconds,” Ms. London says.\nPhoto: Neil Landino 1 . The breakfast nook is awash in cabinets custom-crafted of sycamore wood with glass shelves whose natural green tint provides contrast. “We loved the juxtaposition of tinted green glass against the white and the sycamore,” Ms. London says. The lattice doors slide open and fold away so that the shelves can remain exposed and guests have easy access to the toaster, kettle and coffee maker.\nPrice: $21,000\nPhoto: Neil Landino 2. The client has numerous sets of dishes, organized by type and color, in the various entertaining areas. In the breakfast nook, a white milk-glass cabinet holds 36-piece dinnerware sets and sets of 20 bowls. “The glass cabinets look very open and you can see everything,” says Ms. London. “And it’s truly easy to clean.” The open cabinets hold linens and candles.\nPrice: $4,500\nPhoto: Neil Landino 3. Ms. London starts with function, then considers beauty when approaching a design. Each section of the kitchen is organized to match the activity, and the many sets of flatware are arranged by color and type with light hardwood dividers. The milk-glass drawer fronts have polished nickel handles and custom-fit glass inserts\nPrice: each drawer about $1,200\nPhoto: Neil Landino 4. The kitchen is set up to make cooking for two dozen people a snap. “We have every facility you would need to cook large dinners and breakfasts,” Ms. London says. Drawers full of Le Creuset cast-iron pots and pans are below the ovens, organized by size and color; the tops are in a separate drawer. Red silicone pads line the drawer bottoms to prevent scratches on the glass. Each drawer is 30 inches wide. The kitchen walls behind shelves are painted red for a pop of color.\nPrice: $1,200 a drawer",
