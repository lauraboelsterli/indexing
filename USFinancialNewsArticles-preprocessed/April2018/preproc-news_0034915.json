    "text": "(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb said on Monday its cancer drugs, Opdivo and Yervoy, reduced the risk of the disease spreading or death in previously untreated patients with a type of lung cancer.\nThe combination demonstrated a higher rate of progression-free survival, compared with chemotherapy in a late-stage trial, the company said.\nThe results come a week after rival Merck & Co said a trial testing its blockbuster drug Keytruda as a monotherapy in previously untreated lung cancer patients was successful.\nReporting by Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva\n ",
