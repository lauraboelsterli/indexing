    "text": "The manufacturer of the type of engine that failed on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this week, killing one passenger, is planning to recommend Friday that a broad swath of engines be tested, according to a source familiar with the matter.\nCFM International, a joint venture of General Electric and France's Safran Aircraft Engines, built the CFM56-7B engine, which lost one of its fan blades on Southwest Flight 1380 shortly into a New York to Dallas trip on Tuesday morning. Shrapnel flew, puncturing the fuselage. One of the plane's windows blew out and a passenger, who died, was partly sucked out through the opening. The pilot made an emergency landing in Philadelphia.\nThe manufacturer is set to issue a service bulletin on Friday afternoon, according to the source familiar with the issue. Such bulletins are only recommendations but the Federal Aviation Administration is expected to mandate more rigorous inspections of these commonly used engines within days.\nCFM International recommended more stringent checks of the engines last year after a fan blade on the same type of engine broke during a Southwest flight in 2016. There were no fatalities on that flight, but flying debris punctured the aircraft. The FAA made its own proposal for more testing last year .\nThe updated guidance expected Friday from CFM International was set to be issued even before Southwest Flight 1380 earlier this week, the source said.\nMore than 12,000 of these engines are powering aircraft around the world, and a few thousand could be subject to the ultrasonic fan blade tests, according to the source.The number of cycles, or usage, of the engines will determine whether they will be subjected to the tests, the source said.\nFan blade inspectors often use ultrasonic testing because fractures can be too small to see with the naked eye.\nSome airlines have already ramped up testing of these engines.\nAfter Tuesday's fatal explosion, Southwest said it would speed up tests of these engines and complete the task within 30 days.\nOn an earnings call this week, United Airlines executives said CFM56-7B engine tests are underway in response to guidance from the manufacturer . CEO Oscar Munoz said the tests are included in the airline's cost forecast. The airline has 698 of the engines in its fleet, according to its chief operations officer.\nAmerican Airlines , the world's largest carrier, said it \"voluntarily\" started inspections of its CFM56-7B engines, which power 304 of its Boeing 737-800s, when the FAA proposed more stringent testing last summer.",
