With pipelines nearly full and rail capacity limited, a glut of crude has weighed on Canadian oil prices.\nTransCanada said earnings from its Canadian natural gas pipelines fell 10.2 percent to C$253 million, while earnings from its U.S. pipelines, including the Keystone XL, rose 15.5 percent in the quarter ended March 31.\nNet income attributable to common shares for the first quarter rose to C$734 million, or 83 Canadian cents per share, from C$643 million, or 74 Canadian cents per share, for the same period in 2017. ( bit.ly/2r4qjZn )\nRevenue rose C$3.42 billion from C$3.41 billion.\nTransCanada said it expects to invest more than C$21 billion in the near term, including the Keystone project. It had earlier earmarked C$23 billion. (Reporting by Julie Gordon in Toronto and Yashaswini Swamynathan in Bengaluru Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)",
