    "text": "VANCOUVER, April 18, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Avcorp Industries Inc. (TSX: AVP) (the \"Company\", \"Avcorp\" or the \"Avcorp Group\") today announces that effective April 19, 2018, Peter George has decided to resign his role as CEO of Avcorp Group.\nThe Board has appointed Amandeep Kaler, currently the General Manager of Avcorp's Delta operations, as the new CEO of Avcorp Group.\nPeter George will remain on the Board as a non-executive member and will now chair the executive committee to support the transition with Amandeep Kaler and to remain focused on customers and strategy.\nAmandeep's appointment is an exciting milestone in the succession planning at Avcorp. Amandeep is a recognized leader in the aerospace industry. As General Manager of Avcorp's Delta operations, Amandeep had full P&L responsibility. During his tenure as General Manager Avcorp Delta has achieved excellent delivery and quality performance with all its customers. His 18 years of organizational experience across all disciplines uniquely positions him to lead Avcorp into its next phase of growth.\nThe company's Board of Directors wishes to thank Peter George for his contribution to the company and his inspiring leadership. Since joining the Avcorp leadership team in October of 2014 as CEO, Peter swiftly aligned Avcorp's vision and strategy. In so doing, Peter was instrumental in growing contractual backlog for Avcorp. He also led the acquisition of the Company's new Composites aerospace business in Gardena, California.\nAbout Avcorp\nThe Avcorp Group designs and builds major airframe structures for some of the world's leading aircraft companies, including BAE Systems, Boeing, Bombardier, Lockheed Martin and Subaru Corporation.

Comtek Advanced Structures Ltd., at our Burlington, Ontario, Canada location also provides aircraft operators with aircraft structural component repair services for commercial aircraft.\nAvcorp Composite Fabrication Inc. is wholly owned by Avcorp US Holdings Inc. Both companies are incorporated in the State of Delaware, USA, and are wholly owned subsidiaries of Avcorp Industries Inc.\nComtek Advanced Structures Ltd., incorporated in the Province of Ontario, Canada, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Avcorp Industries Inc.\nAvcorp Industries Inc. is a federally incorporated reporting company in Canada and traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX:AVP).\n(signed)\nDAVID LEVI\nCHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD\nAVCORP GROUP\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis release should be read in conjunction with the Company's unaudited financial statements contained in the Company's Annual Report and with the quarterly financial statements and accompanying notes filed with Sedar ( www.sedar.com ).\nCertain statements in this release and other oral and written statements made by the Company from time to time are forward-looking statements, including those that discuss strategies, goals, outlook or other non‑historical matters; or projected revenues, income, returns or other financial measures.
