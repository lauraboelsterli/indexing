    "text": "Declares 34-Cent Second-Quarter 2018 Dividend\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The board of directors of Pfizer Inc. today declared a 34-cent second-quarter 2018 dividend on the company’s common stock, payable June 1, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 11, 2018. The second-quarter 2018 cash dividend will be the 318 th consecutive quarterly dividend paid by Pfizer.\n“In 2017, we returned nearly $12.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases,” said Ian Read, chairman and chief executive officer. “In 2018, we continue to enhance shareholder value through our dividend increase announced in December 2017 and share repurchases. In addition, we will continue to strengthen our Innovative Health and Essential Health businesses, as well as advance our commercial therapies and late-stage pipeline, while maintaining the financial flexibility to pursue initiatives that create the most value for our shareholders.”\nPreliminary results from the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held today indicate that the company’s 12 director nominees were re-elected to one-year terms and that shareholders ratified the selection of KPMG LLP as Pfizer’s independent registered public accounting firm for the 2018 fiscal year. In addition, shareholders supported the board-sponsored proposals to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the company’s named executive officers and to approve the Pfizer Inc. French Sub-Plan under the 2014 Stock Plan, solely to comply with the shareholder authorization requirement under French tax laws to permit the granting of tax-favored French-qualified restricted stock units (RSUs).\nIn other voting, the shareholder proposals were not approved.\nThe final results are subject to verification by the independent inspectors of election. The final results will be reported on a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed by Pfizer with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days.\nPfizer Inc.: Working together for a healthier world®\nAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.
