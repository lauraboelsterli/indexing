    "text": "0 COMMENTS A wild ride for metals closely tied to Russia continued Thursday, with aluminum and nickel erasing early gains in a volatile trading session.\nAluminum for delivery in three months on the London Metal Exchange was recently down 1.1% at $2,508.50 a metric ton, after earlier rising as much as 7.1% and piercing $2,700.\nMeanwhile, nickel for delivery in 90 days was recently down 0.6% at $15,195 a metric ton, also sliding after climbing more than 9% and breaching $16,500 earlier in the day.\nBoth metals have surged to fresh multiyear highs since U.S. sanctions against Russian individuals and entities were announced April 6, with aluminum at its highest level since 2011 and up more than 20% in a matter of days and nickel also climbing sharply.\nThe sanctions hit Russian metals tycoon Oleg Deripaska, who controls the world’s second-largest aluminum producer, United Co. Rusal 0486 26.06% PLC. And because Rusal owns 28% of Norilsk Nickel Mining & Metallurgical Co. and some analysts think Norilsk could also be affected by sanctions moving forward, nickel has also gotten a boost from the supply uncertainty.\nBut some traders remain uncertain what the long-term impact of the sanctions could be, noting that supply from China could fill the void. Rusal shares have plummeted since the sanctions were announced but surged 26% Thursday following a Bloomberg report that officials met Chinese companies and traders this week to discuss the possibility of buying alumina, a key ingredient for making the metal, and selling aluminum.\nSome analysts have said outsize swings in stockpiles and immense uncertainty could continue driving huge moves in the relatively illiquid markets.\n“It will take some time and more reasonable price action and some kind of equilibrium before the markets return to some level of normality,” said Tai Wong, head of metals trading at BMO Capital Markets.\nVolatility related to Russia has also ensnared palladium, as the country accounts for about 40% of supply. Futures prices of the metal used to scrub emissions in diesel engines were down 1.8% in New York Thursday but also have rocketed since the sanctions were announced.\nElsewhere in base metals, copper for May delivery edged down 1.2% to $3.1210 a pound, following aluminum and nickel lower.\nAmong precious metals, gold for June delivery edged down 0.3% to $1,350 a troy ounce, staying in its 2018 trading range as worries about higher interest rates and a stable dollar continue to offset haven demand.\nWrite to David Hodari at David.Hodari@wsj.com",
