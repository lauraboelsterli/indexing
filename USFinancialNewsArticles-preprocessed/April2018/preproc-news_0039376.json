    "text": "PALM BEACH, Fla.—Riding a van back to Mar-a-Lago after a news conference this week, White House officials told economic adviser Lawrence Kudlow that he had just said something bound to produce some unwanted headlines.\nMr. Kudlow had suggested that Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, suffered “momentary confusion” when she said on TV over the weekend that the U.S. was poised to slap Russia with new sanctions. Ms. Haley hadn’t been told those plans had changed—something Mr. Kudlow didn’t know until later.\n ",
