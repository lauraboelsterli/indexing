The drop was mainly attributable to lower production in Angola, Venezuela, Algeria and Saudi Arabia. \nBut OPEC said that the world’s total oil supply rose by 180,000 barrels a day last month, mainly as a result of higher output from non-OPEC producers like the U.S., Norway and the U.K. \nU.S. shale fracking is one of the primary drivers of non-OPEC production, with tight and shale formations expected to account for 94% of total petroleum liquids growth this year, compared with 90% in 2017, OPEC said in the report. \nRead an expanded version of this article at WSJ.com.
