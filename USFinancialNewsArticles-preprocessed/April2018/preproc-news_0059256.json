    "text": "CALGARY, Alberta, April 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hemostemix Inc. (“ Hemostemix ” or the “ Company ”) (TSX VENTURE:HEM) is pleased to announce that it has entered into an agreement and has received all approvals from the Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute (“VCHRI”) located in Vancouver, BC to be a clinical trial site for the Company’s Phase II clinical trial for critical limb ischemia (“CLI”). The Company recently announced that it received FDA approval in the United States in addition to Health Canada approval for its clinical trial in Canada.\nWith the engagement of Topstone Research Inc. (“Topstone”) in September 2017, the Company has been actively identifying and selecting qualified clinical trial sites in both Canada and the United States. To date, over 20 facilities and institutions have been identified as having good potential to be sites for the clinical trial. The site onboarding process is rigorous with the Company reviewing equipment, facilities, principal investigators, the estimated number of potential patients as well as putting in place agreements, budgets, procedures and protocols. In addition, the clinical trial sites have their own internal protocols for review and approval of the Company’s clinical trial protocol, agreement, overall budget and general procedures and equipment requirements.\nOf the potential sites, the Company has approximately 14 clinical trial sites in various stages of the on-boarding process including 5 sites that have approved the Company’s clinical trial agreement pending final review board or budget approvals. It is anticipated that the clinical trial will be conducted at approximately 20 sites located throughout Canada and the United States.\n“We are excited to announce that Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute has agreed to be part of the clinical trial. VCHRI has a strong history of supporting research surrounding CLI and we thank Dr. Hsiang and his team for their dedication to this research. With this first trial site in place, we look forward to further sites being fully onboarded as well as patient treatment.” states Kyle Makofka, CEO and President of Hemostemix.\nABOUT VANCOUVER COASTAL HEALTH RESEARCH INSTITUTE\nVCHRI is a world leader in translational health research with over 1,500 personnel engaged in research. It is the research body of Vancouver Coastal Health and a health partner of the University of British Columbia. VCHRI includes three of BC’s largest academic and teaching health sciences centers — Vancouver General Hospital, UBC Hospital and GF Strong Rehabilitation Centre — as well as other hospitals and public health agencies across Vancouver Coastal Health.\nOptions Approved\nThe Board of Directors of the Company also announced it has approved the granting of 6,300,000 options pursuant to the Company’s existing incentive stock option plan to certain directors, officers, employees and consultants of the Company. The options have an exercise price of $0.10 per common share and expire five years from the date of grant and generally have up to one-third vesting on each of the first, second and third anniversaries from the date of grant.\nABOUT HEMOSTEMIX INC.\nHemostemix is a publicly traded clinical-stage biotechnology company that develops and commercializes innovative blood-derived cell therapies for medical conditions not adequately addressed by current treatments. It is the first clinical-stage biotech company to test a stem-cell therapy in an international, multicenter, Phase II clinical trial for patients with critical limb ischemia (“CLI”), a severe form of peripheral artery disease (“PAD”) caused by reduced blood flow to the legs. The Phase II trial targets a participant’s diseased tissue with proprietary cells grown from his or her blood that can support the formation of new blood vessels. The Company’s intellectual property portfolio includes over 50 patents issued or pending throughout the world. Hemostemix has a manufacturing contract with Aspire Health Science, LLP (“Aspire”), for the production of ACP-01 and for research and development purposes at Aspire’s Orlando, Florida, facility.
