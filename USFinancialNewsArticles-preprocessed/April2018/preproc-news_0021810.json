    "text": "(Reuters) - Chipmaker Broadcom Inc said on Thursday it would buy back up to $12 billion of its common stock, sending its shares up 4.5 percent to $250 in extended trading.\nFILE PHOTO: A sign to the campus offices of chip maker Broadcom Ltd is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., November 6, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File photo The company, which last month ended its efforts to acquire rival Qualcomm Inc, said the repurchase program will begin effective immediately and could go on until the end of its fiscal year on Nov.3.\nBroadcom moved back to the United States from Singapore earlier this month, following U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to block its $117 billion offer to buy Qualcomm on national security concerns.\nThe San Jose, California based company has about 411 million outstanding shares and a market value of about $98.71 billion as of Thursday’s close.\nReporting by Uday Sampath in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur\n ",
