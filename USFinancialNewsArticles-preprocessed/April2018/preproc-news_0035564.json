    "text": "IBM will report financial results for the first quarter after the bell on Tuesday. The company will hold a teleconference with analysts at 5 p.m. Eastern time. \nHere's what the street is expecting, according to Thomson Reuters:\n- Earnings: $2.42 per share excluding certain items.\n- Revenue: $18.84 billion.\nLast quarter, IBM announced revenue growth from the year-ago quarter for the first time in more than five years. Analysts think IBM will continue that streak. \nCantor Fitzgerald analysts led by Joseph Foresi said in a Friday note that they expect IBM to report gains from companies upgrading to IBM's latest mainframe computer, the z14. \nIBM continues to seek growth from its strategic imperatives, which include social, mobile, analytics and cloud. In the fourth quarter that group contributed 49 percent of all revenue, and the Cantor analysts expect that balance to be unchanged in the first quarter.\nWith respect to guidance, for the second quarter analysts expect IBM to forecast $3.05 in earnings per share, excluding certain items, on $19.9 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters. \nIn the first quarter IBM announced the Cloud Private for Data software and an expansion of its partnership with Salesforce.\nIBM stock is up 4 percent since the beginning of the year.\nThis is breaking news. Please check back for updates.",
