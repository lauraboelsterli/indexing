However, such name change has not yet occurred and the name of ISL currently remains “ Redwood Floating Rate Income Fund” .

Units of IFL are currently listed and traded on the TSX under the ticker symbol IFL.UN.

In addition, units of IFL currently trading on the TSX under the ticker symbol IFL.UN will be de-listed on or about the Effective Date.\nIn accordance with applicable legal requirements, securityholders of each of IFL and ISL will be required to approve the Merger.
