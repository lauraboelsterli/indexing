    "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif., April 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Flex (NASDAQ: FLEX), the Sketch-to-Scale™ solutions provider that designs and builds Intelligent Products for a Connected World™, today announced results for its fourth quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nUS$ in millions, except earnings (losses) per share\nThree-Month Periods Ended\nTwelve-Month Periods Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\nMarch 31,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2018\nMarch 31,\n2017\nNet sales\n$ 6,411\n$ 5,863\n$ 25,441\n$ 23,863\nGAAP income before income taxes\n16\n99\n521\n371\nAdjusted operating income\n200\n205\n786\n815\nGAAP net income (loss)\n(20)\n87\n429\n320\nAdjusted net income\n150\n156\n585\n640\nGAAP EPS\n(0.04)\n0.16\n0.80\n0.59\nAdjusted EPS\n0.28\n0.29\n1.09\n1.17\nAn explanation and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is presented in Schedule II attached to this press release.\n\"Fiscal 2018 marked a return to revenue growth for Flex and highlighted how our strategy of pursuing portfolio evolution and investing in our Sketch-to-Scale capabilities is driving revenue momentum as we enter fiscal 2019,\" said Mike McNamara, CEO at Flex.\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Results of Operations\nNet sales for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $6.4 billion, growing 9% year-over-year at the higher end of the guidance range of $6.1 to $6.5 billion. GAAP income before income taxes was $16 million for the quarter and adjusted operating income was $200 million, at the low end of the guidance range of $200 million to $230 million. GAAP net loss was $20 million and adjusted net income for the quarter was $150 million. GAAP net loss per share was $0.04 for the quarter and adjusted EPS was $0.28 for the quarter.\nFiscal Year 2018 Results Operation\nNet sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 were $25.4 billion. Fiscal year 2018 GAAP income before income tax was $521 million and fiscal year 2018 adjusted operating income was $786 million. GAAP EPS was $0.80 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.09 for fiscal year 2018.\nFlex's fiscal year 2018 performance illustrates its portfolio evolution to higher margin businesses. The Company's two higher margin business groups, High Reliability Solutions (HRS) and Industrial & Emerging Industries (IEI), combined were $10.7 billion or 43% of net sales in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, a $1.6 billion increase from a year ago.\nCash Flow and Balance Sheet\nFlex generated cash from operations of $323 million and $754 million for the three and twelve-month periods ended March 31, 2018, respectively. Free cash flow was $195 million and $236 million for the three and twelve-month periods ended March 31, 2018. The Company repurchased ordinary shares for approximately $180 million during the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2018, reflecting its commitment to return over 50% of annual free cash flow to its shareholders.\nFlex ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion of cash on hand and total debt of approximately $2.9 billion. The balance sheet remains well-positioned to support the business over the long-term.\nFirst Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Guidance\nFor the first quarter ending June 29, 2018, revenue is expected to be in the range of $6.3 to $6.7 billion. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.22 to $0.26 per diluted share. GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.19 and includes stock-based compensation expense and intangible amortization. The Company's guidance excludes the impact from adoption of ASU 2014-09 \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\".\nOther Events\nIn keeping with the Company's high standard of corporate governance, the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors, with the assistance of independent outside counsel, is undertaking an independent investigation of allegations made by an employee including that the Company improperly accounted for obligations in a customer contract and certain related reserves. The independent outside counsel also notified the San Francisco office of the Securities and Exchange Commission of the allegations and that it will report the findings of the independent investigation upon its conclusion.\nAt this time, the Company is not aware of any issues under investigation that will materially affect the fourth quarter or fiscal year results, but the investigation is ongoing. The Company has also not yet determined whether the issues will impact previously reported periods and, if so, whether that impact will be material. The historic, fourth quarter, and fiscal year results disclosed in this release do not reflect the impact, if any, from the issues under investigation.\nWebcast and Conference Call\nFlex management team will host a conference call today at 2:00 PM (PT) / 5:00 PM (ET), to review fourth quarter fiscal 2018 results. A live webcast of the event and slides will be available on the Flex Investor Relations website at http://investors.flex.com . An audio replay and transcript will also be available after the event on the Flex Investor Relations website.\nAbout Flex\nFlex Ltd. (Reg.

Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), the Company discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain charges, including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share. These supplemental measures exclude restructuring charges, stock-based compensation expense, intangible amortization, other discrete events as applicable and the related tax effects. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We believe that these non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with Flex's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate Flex's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measures. We compensate for the limitations of non-GAAP financial measures by relying upon GAAP results to gain a complete picture of the Company's performance.\nIn calculating non-GAAP financial measures, we exclude certain items to facilitate a review of the comparability of the Company's operating performance on a period-to-period basis because such items are not, in our view, related to the Company's ongoing operational performance. We use non-GAAP measures to evaluate the operating performance of our business, for comparison with forecasts and strategic plans, for calculating return on investment, and for benchmarking performance externally against competitors. In addition, management's incentive compensation is determined using certain non-GAAP measures. Also, when evaluating potential acquisitions, we exclude certain of the items described below from consideration of the target's performance and valuation. Since we find these measures to be useful, we believe that investors benefit from seeing results \"through the eyes\" of management in addition to seeing GAAP results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when read in conjunction with the Company's GAAP financials, provide useful information to investors by offering:\n•\nthe ability to make more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the Company's on-going operating results;\n•\nthe ability to better identify trends in the Company's underlying business and perform related trend analyses;\n•\na better understanding of how management plans and measures the Company's underlying business; and\n•\nan easier way to compare the Company's operating results against analyst financial models and operating results of competitors that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures.\nThe following are explanations of each of the adjustments that we incorporate into non-GAAP measures, as well as the reasons for excluding each of these individual items in the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures:\nStock-based compensation expense consists of non-cash charges for the estimated fair value of stock options and unvested restricted share unit awards granted to employees and assumed in business acquisitions. The Company believes that the exclusion of these charges provides for more accurate comparisons of its operating results to peer companies due to the varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. In addition, the Company believes it is useful to investors to understand the specific impact stock-based compensation expense has on its operating results.\nIntangible amortization consists primarily of non-cash charges that can be impacted by, among other things, the timing and magnitude of acquisitions. The Company considers its operating results without these charges when evaluating its ongoing performance and forecasting its earnings trends, and therefore excludes such charges when presenting non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that the assessment of its operations excluding these costs is relevant to its assessment of internal operations and comparisons to the performance of its competitors.\nDistressed customers asset impairments consist primarily of non-cash inventory impairments of certain inventory on hand to net realizable value as well as additional provisions for doubtful accounts receivable for customers that are experiencing significant financial difficulties. These costs are excluded by the Company's management in assessing current operating performance and forecasting its earnings trends and are therefore excluded by the Company from its non-GAAP measures. See additional description related to the specific period charge as applicable below.\nContingencies and other consists primarily of charges in connection with certain legal matters of which loss contingencies are believed to be probable and estimable. It also includes non-cash impairment of certain assets and damages incurred from natural disasters which are not directly related to ongoing or core business results, and do not reflect expected future operating expense. These costs are excluded by the Company's management in assessing current operating performance and forecasting its earnings trends and are therefore excluded by the Company from its non-GAAP measures.\nRestructuring charges include severance for rationalization at existing sites and corporate SG&A functions as well as asset impairment, lease termination, and other charges relate to the closures and consolidations of certain operating sites. These costs may vary in size based on the Company's initiatives, and are not directly related to ongoing or core business results, and do not reflect expected future operating expenses. These costs are excluded by the Company's management in assessing current operating performance and forecasting its earnings trends, and are therefore excluded by the Company from its non-GAAP measures.\nAdjustment for taxes relates to the tax effects of the various adjustments that we incorporate into non-GAAP measures in order to provide a more meaningful measure on non-GAAP net income and certain adjustments related to non-recurring settlements of tax contingencies or other non-recurring tax charges, when applicable.\nInvestment and other, net consists of various other types of items that are not directly related to ongoing or core business results, such as the gain or loss from certain divestitures and impairment charges associated with non-core investments. We exclude these items because they are not related to the Company's ongoing operating performance or do not affect core operations. Excluding these amounts provide investors with a basis to compare Company performance against the performance of other companies without this variability.\nFor the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2018, Free Cash Flow was $236 million consisting of GAAP net cash flows from operating activities of approximately $754 million less purchases of property and equipment net of proceeds from dispositions of $518 million. We believe Free Cash Flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, fund acquisitions and for certain other activities. Since Free Cash Flow includes investments in operating assets, we believe this non-GAAP liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable GAAP measure – \"net cash flows provided by operating activities.\"\n(2)\nBasic shares were used in calculating diluted GAAP EPS for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 due to the net loss recognized during the period. Diluted shares for Q4 fiscal 2018 were 535,234 thousand which were used in calculating diluted Non-GAAP EPS for the quarter.\n(3)\nDistressed customers asset impairments for fiscal year 2018 relate to additional provision for doubtful accounts receivable for certain customers experiencing significant financial difficulties or contract disengagements.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, prices for solar panel modules declined significantly. The Company determined that certain solar panel inventory on hand as of September 30, 2016, was not fully recoverable and recorded a charge of $60 million to reduce the carrying costs to market in the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2017. The Company also recognized a $16 million impairment charge for solar module equipment and $16.9 million primarily related to negative margin sales and other associated solar panel direct costs. The total charge of $92.9 million is included in cost of sales for the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2017.\n(4)\nContingencies and other during fiscal year 2018 consists of charges in connection with certain legal matters of which loss contingencies are believed to be probable and estimable. The Company incurred various other charges predominantly related to damages incurred from a typhoon that impacted one of its China facilities. Additionally, certain asset impairments were recorded during both fiscal year 2017 and 2018.\n(5)\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company and other minority shareholders of Elementum amended certain agreements and as a result, the Company concluded it no longer had majority control and accordingly, deconsolidated the entity. As part of the deconsolidation, the Company recognized a gain of approximately $151.6 million with no related tax impact, which is included in other charges (income), net for fiscal year 2018.\n(6)\nThe company sold its Wink business during first quarter of fiscal year 2018 to an unrelated third-party venture backed company in exchange for contingent consideration fair valued at $59 million and recognized a gain on sale of $38.7 million, which is recorded in other charges (income), net for fiscal year 2018.\nIn addition, the Company recorded $4.1 million and $21.9 million in the three-month and twelve-month periods ended March 31, 2018, respectively, for impairment of certain non-core investments.\nThe twelve-month period ended March 31, 2017 includes a $7.4 million loss attributable to a non-strategic facility sold during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017.\n(7)\nRecognition of a non-recurring, non-cash, valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in a foreign operating subsidiary offset by the recognition of an associated income tax receivable for prior years.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/flex-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2018-results-300637566.html\nSOURCE Flex",
