    "text": "NEWARK, Calif., April 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Depomed, Inc. (NASDAQ:DEPO) today announced the appointment of Stan Bukofzer, M.D., as Senior Vice President, Chief Medical and Scientific Officer, effective immediately. Dr. Bukofzer most recently served as Chief Medical Officer at Ocera Therapeutics, Inc., a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on acute and chronic orphan liver diseases. The appointment of Dr. Bukofzer follows the decision by Santosh Vetticaden, M.D., Ph.D., Depomed’s current Senior Vice President, Chief Medical and Scientific Officer, not to relocate to the company’s new Lake Forest, Illinois corporate headquarters. Dr. Vetticaden will remain with the Company through the end of April to ensure a smooth transition.\nStan brings a deep understanding of medical affairs, a strong track record of clinical development and extensive experience of scientific support for product in-licensing. He is a great asset to Depomed at this pivotal time as we advance our Three Pillar Growth Strategy,” said Arthur Higgins, President and CEO of Depomed.\nDr. Bukofzer brings over 20 years of medical and scientific executive leadership experience to this role. Prior to joining Ocera, Dr. Bukofzer served as Chief Medical Officer of Hospira, Inc., where he oversaw the strategic direction and technical leadership of the Medical function across the company’s global device and pharmaceutical businesses. Dr. Bukofzer received his medical degrees from the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa with accreditations in internal medicine, gastroenterology and hepatology.\n“I am excited to be joining Depomed at such a transformational time for the business,” said Dr. Bukofzer. “Depomed presents a rare opportunity to play a central role in the building of a leading specialty pharmaceutical company that is focused on addressing important areas of therapeutic need.\"\nManagement and the Board would like to thank Dr. Vetticaden for his contributions and wish him all the best on his next opportunity.\nCommented Dr. Vetticaden “I have enjoyed the opportunity to work at Depomed and look forward to seeing the company’s further evolution.”\nAbout Depomed\nDepomed is a leading specialty pharmaceutical company focused on enhancing the lives of patients, families, physicians, providers and payors through the commercialization of products in the areas of pain and neurology, and in the development of drugs in areas of unmet medical need.
