    "text": "LAKEWOOD, N.J., April 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- UNEX Manufacturing, Inc. , the trusted industry leader in providing innovative order picking solutions, announces the acquisition of SpeedCell Storage Systems of Zeeland, MI. SpeedCell’s dynamic high-density storage solution products complement Unex’s Span-Track Carton Flow and Flow Cell product lines, bringing an added dimension of a high-density storage medium to the pick, put or assembly line. The UNEX SpeedCell product line is a unique low cost solution to increase SKU density while reducing actual space requirements.\n“We are very excited with this addition of SpeedCell and how it complements our pick, put and place storage solutions for manufacturing and distribution right up to the last mile,” said Mark Neuwirth, VP of Business Development, UNEX Manufacturing. “We now have a better solution for those items whose throughput simply require a better pick and storage medium then settling for traditional static shelving.”\nUNEX unveiled the merger on the eve of MODEX 2018, one of the world’s largest material handling and supply chain shows. UNEX has acquired the business assets of SpeedCell Storage Systems, manufacturer of the SpeedCell dynamic high-density storage solution products.\n“Bringing high-density solutions to UNEX’s foremost Flow Cell Span-Track systems reduces labor cost per pick, eliminates the need to hire additional workers and increases productivity,” adds Neuwirth. “It’s a win-win situation for both companies and the industry.”\nThe UNEX SpeedCell replaced deep cardboard boxes holding products for one customer, resulting in eliminating beam levels and adding locations at the floor level. By removing deep pins, order pickers have to simply reach into the cells and select parts, saving time. Picks are more ergonomic as multiple levels were eliminated.\nAbout UNEX Manufacturing, Inc.\nFounded in 1964, UNEX is the trusted industry leader in order picking solutions that maximize space usage, increase pick rates and improve ergonomics. UNEX offers a full range of order picking solutions, including their patented carton flow solution Span-Track , a full line of gravity conveyor products tailored to the order picking process and UNEX Flow Cells for durable, modular and portable storage for the manufacturing floor.
