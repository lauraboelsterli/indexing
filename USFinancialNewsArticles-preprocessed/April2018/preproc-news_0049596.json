    "text": "ANDOVER, MA, Vicor Corporation (NASDAQ:VICR) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. These results will be discussed later today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, during management’s quarterly investor conference call. The details for the call are presented below.\nRevenues for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased to $65,269,000, compared to $54,462,000 for the corresponding period a year ago, and increased from $58,771,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017. First quarter bookings increased to $81,907,000 from $57,891,000 for the corresponding period a year ago, and increased from $71,343,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nGross margin increased to $30,211,000 for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $23,652,000 for the corresponding period a year ago, and increased from $26,931,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017. Gross margin, as a percentage of revenue, increased to 46.3% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 43.4% for the corresponding period a year ago, and increased from 45.8% for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNet income for the first quarter was $3,943,000, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $(974,000), or $(0.02) per share, for the corresponding period a year ago and net income of $1,611,000, or $0.04 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCash used for operating activities totaled $812,000 for the first quarter of 2018, compared to cash used for operating activities of $1,347,000 for the corresponding period a year ago and cash used for operating activities of $3,752,000 for the preceding fourth quarter of 2017. Cash and cash equivalents sequentially decreased by $1,552,000 to approximately $42,678,000 at the end of the first quarter of 2018 from $44,230,000 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017.\nTotal backlog at the end of the first quarter of 2018 was $89,975,000, compared to $73,054,000 at the end of 2017.\nCommenting on recent developments, Dr. Patrizio Vinciarelli, Chief Executive Officer, stated, “The transition of XPUs (CPUs, GPUs and ASICs) to 48V is accelerating with the recent introduction of GPUs whose high performance is enabled by Power-on-Package (“PoP”) Modular Current Multipliers (“MCMs”). We believe data center and automotive applications of accelerated computing platforms will bring about broader conversion from 12V legacy infrastructure to 48V to efficiently power AI processors that draw more than 1000 Amperes at less than 1V while demanding greater I/O connectivity. This emerging trend is being reflected in our bookings and revenue growth.”\nDr. Vinciarelli continued, “With $90 million in backlog as of the end of Q1, Q2 revenues may increase nearly 10% sequentially. With rising volumes and economies of scale, gross margins are also expected to increase.”\n﻿\nFor more information on Vicor and its products, please visit the Company’s website at www.vicorpower.com .\nEarnings Conference Call\nVicor will be holding its investor conference call today, Tuesday, April 24, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.
