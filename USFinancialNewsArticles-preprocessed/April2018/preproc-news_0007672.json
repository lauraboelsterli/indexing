There was the window-rattling sonic boom produced by successful flights, which precluded airlines from scheduling overland routes. And there was the cost of fueling four gas-guzzling turbojet engines, which required 6,770 gallons of fuel an hour to reach and maintain a cruising speed of Mach 2â€”just under 1,500 miles per hour.
