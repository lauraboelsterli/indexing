    "text": "BROOKLYN, N.Y., April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dime Community Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ:DCOM) (the “Company” or “Dime”), the parent company of Dime Community Bank (the “bank”), today reported net income of $14.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, or $0.39 per diluted common share, compared with net income of $15.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, or $0.41 per diluted common share, and net income of $11.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, or $0.30 per diluted common share.\nHighlights for the first quarter of 2018 included:\nNew loan originations for the first quarter were at generally higher rates than the overall loan portfolio; the weighted average rate (“WAR”) on new real estate originations was 4.17% and the WAR on new C&I originations was 4.81%, compared to the total loan portfolio WAR of 3.61% for the three months ended March 31, 2018; Continued the build out of the Business Banking division via the hire of a new team that will operate from the Company’s Borough Park branch location and the creation of an additional team from existing personnel. Pro forma for these two new teams, the Company’s Business Banking division has six teams in total; Consolidated Company CRE concentration ratio declined to 748.6% at March 31, 2018, versus 906.5% at March 31, 2017; Total non-interest income was $3.2 million for the first quarter of 2018, driven by a $1.4 million gain from the sale of a portion of the securities the Company had previously retained from its Freddie Mac sponsored “Q-deal” securitization; Increase in the Company’s on-balance sheet liquidity levels, as average mortgage-backed securities and other short-term investments, as a percentage of average interest-earning assets increased to 9.1% for the quarter versus 4.0% for the prior quarter; Loan-to-deposit ratio declined to 124% at March 31, 2018, versus 128% at March 31, 2017; and Reported book value per share and tangible book value (common equity less goodwill, divided by number of shares outstanding) per share grew to $16.22 and $14.73, respectively, at March 31, 2018.\nKenneth J. Mahon, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, stated, “We are on track to achieve our full year 2018 portfolio growth targets for the Business Banking division, as we have a strong pipeline in place. The Business Banking division ended the first quarter with approximately $61 million of low-cost relationship-based deposits at an average cost of 16 basis points. Across the organization, we are highly focused on improving the composition of our deposit base.”\nMr. Mahon concluded, “Our employees are hard at work, ensuring our core systems conversion, which is scheduled to be completed in June, proceeds smoothly. The move to a new core platform will enable us to more effectively service our customers and is consistent with our stated goal of transitioning into a successful community commercial bank.”\nManagement’s Discussion of Quarterly Operating Results\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income in the first quarter of 2018 was $38.0 million, a decrease of $0.7 million (-1.9%) from the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase of $0.5 million (+1.4%) over the first quarter of 2017. Net interest margin (“NIM”) was 2.47% during the first quarter of 2018, compared to 2.50% in the fourth quarter of 2017, and 2.57% during the first quarter of 2017. The linked quarter decrease in NIM was due to an increase in the level of on balance sheet liquidity levels and a 11 basis point increase in the average cost of funds, partially offset by a 13 basis point increase in the average yield on total real estate loans.\nAverage interest-earning assets were $6.15 billion for the first quarter of 2018, a 3.8% (annualized) decrease from $6.20 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017, and a 5.5% increase from $5.82 billion for the first quarter of 2017. The linked quarter decline in average interest-earnings assets was primarily driven by a decline in real estate loans, as the volume of loan payoffs exceeded new originations.\nAverage mortgage backed-securities and other short-term investments were $561.2 million for the first quarter of 2018, a 508.6% (annualized) increase from $247.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, and a 382.3% increase from $116.4 million for the first quarter of 2017. “In keeping with our strategic asset diversification objectives, and after reviewing the results of our numerous liquidity stress testing scenarios, we have significantly increased our on-balance sheet liquidity levels over the past few quarters,” stated Mr. Mahon.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the average yield on interest-earning assets was 3.58%, an increase of 6 basis points compared with the fourth quarter of 2017, and an increase of 5 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2017. The average cost of funds (which includes Federal Home Loan Bank advances) was 1.30% for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 11 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2017, and an increase of 17 basis points versus the first quarter of 2017.\nLoans\nThe real estate loan portfolio declined by $103.5 million (7.6% annualized) during the first quarter of 2018 due primarily to an increase in the level of loan payoffs versus the fourth quarter of 2017. Real estate loan originations were $75.0 million during the first quarter of 2018, at a weighted average interest rate of 4.17%, compared to $70.6 million of originations for the prior quarter, at a weighted average interest rate of 4.36%. Real estate loan amortization and satisfactions totaled $183.1 million, or 13.6% (annualized) of the portfolio balance, at an average rate of 3.65%. The annualized loan payoff rate of 13.6% for the first quarter of 2018 was higher than both the fourth quarter of 2017 (10.2%) and the first quarter of 2017 (10.8%). Average real estate loans were $5.44 billion in the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of $388.4 million (26.7% annualized) from the fourth quarter of 2017, and a decrease of $252.2 million (4.4%) from the first quarter of 2017.\nIncluded in total real estate loan originations during the first quarter of 2018 were $21.2 million of originations from the Business Banking division at a weighted average rate of 4.21%, compared to $24.1 million of originations at a weighted average rate of 4.78% during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCommercial and industrial (“C&I”) loan originations were $25.3 million during the first quarter of 2018, at a weighted average rate of 4.81%, compared to $27.5 million at a weighted average rate of 4.94% during the fourth quarter of 2017. Total C&I loan balances were $145.8 million at the end of the first quarter of 2018, compared to $136.7 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017.\nDeposits and Borrowed Funds\nThe Company continues to focus on growing relationship-based deposits sourced from its retail branches and Business Banking division. On a year-over-year basis, the sum of average non-interest-bearing checking account balances and average interest-bearing checking account balances increased by 8.2% to $435.1 million for the first quarter of 2018.\nThe average cost of total deposits increased 9 basis points on a linked quarter basis to 1.00% as the bank increased rates on selective money market and certificates of deposit products in light of increased competition. Overall, total deposits increased by $27.0 million during the first quarter of 2018 from the linked quarter. Mr. Mahon commented, “We grew deposits in the first quarter despite approximately $83.0 million of net outflows from our DimeDirect internet channel, where our posted rate continues to lag our online competitors. Our funding focus remains on generating core business deposits, and as such we have maintained a less aggressive online deposit pricing posture. We intend to manage the balance sheet and the loan-to-deposit ratio with the goal of keeping deposit betas as low as possible.”\nThe loan-to-deposit ratio was 124.3% at March 31, 2018, compared to 127.2% at December 31, 2017 and 127.6% at March 31, 2017.\nReflecting deposit inflows and lower total assets, total borrowings were decreased by $159.6 million during the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. To better position the Company for rising interest rates, the Company reduced its level of short-term borrowings in the first quarter of 2018 and entered into $170.0 million of long-term borrowings (with terms of 2 years and more), at an average rate of 2.57%. This compares to $110.0 million of long-term borrowings at an average rate of 2.22% for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income was $3.2 million during the first quarter of 2018, which was $10.5 million lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, and an increase of $1.5 million compared to the first quarter of 2017. The linked quarter decrease in non-interest income was primarily the result of gains of $10.4 million from the sale of real estate property and $1.5 million from the sale of loans in the fourth quarter of 2017, offset by $1.4 million of gains during the first quarter of 2018 from the sale of securities that the bank had retained from its Freddie Mac sponsored Q-deal securitization.\nNon-Interest Expense\nTotal non-interest expense was $21.7 million during the first quarter of 2018, $22.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, and $20.8 million during the first quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase in non-interest expense was primarily the result of a $1.3 million increase in salaries and employee benefits.\nThe ratio of non-interest expense to average assets was 1.36% during the first quarter of 2018, lower than both 1.41% during the fourth quarter of 2017, and 1.38% during the first quarter of 2017.\nThe efficiency ratio was 54.6% during the first quarter of 2018, lower than the 55.63% during the fourth quarter of 2017, and higher than the 53.0% during the first quarter of 2017.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe reported effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 declined to 23.7%. The lower tax rate was the result of recently enacted corporate tax reform.\nCredit Quality\nNon-performing loans were $1.7 million, or 0.03% of total loans, at March 31, 2018, an increase from $0.5 million, or 0.01% of total loans, at December 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses was 0.39% of total loans at March 31, 2018, versus 0.38% at December 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, non-performing assets represented 2.5% of the sum of the bank’s tangible common equity plus the allowance for loan losses and reserve for contingent liabilities (this non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principle (“GAAP”) statistic is otherwise known as the \"Texas Ratio\") (see “Problem Assets as a Percentage of Tangible Capital and Reserves” table and “Non-GAAP Reconciliation” table at the end of this news release), which is lower than the ratio of 3.4% at December 31, 2017. A loan loss provision of $0.2 million was recorded during the first quarter of 2018, compared to a credit for loan losses of $1.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, and a provision for loan losses of $0.5 million during the first quarter of 2017.\nCapital Management\nThe Company’s consolidated Tier 1 capital to average assets (“leverage ratio”), which was 8.79% at March 31, 2018, was in excess of all applicable regulatory requirements.\nThe bank’s regulatory capital ratios continued to be in excess of all applicable regulatory requirements inclusive of conservation buffer amounts. At March 31, 2018, the bank’s leverage ratio was 9.59%, while Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and Total capital to risk-weighted assets ratios were 12.97% and 13.43%, respectively.\nDiluted earnings per common share of $0.39 exceeded the quarterly $0.14 cash dividend per share by 179% during the first quarter of 2018, equating to a 35.9% dividend payout ratio.\nBook value per share was $16.22 and tangible book value (common equity less goodwill divided by number of shares outstanding) per share was $14.73 at March 31, 2018.\nEarnings Call Information\nThe Company will conduct a conference call at 5:30 p.m. (ET) on Thursday, April 26, 2018, during which President and Chief Executive Officer, Kenneth J.
