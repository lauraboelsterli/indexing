DBX, +2.94% and Zscaler Inc ZS, +0.90% \nIn recent weeks, bankers say there has been a steady drumbeat of so-called bakeoffs, in which companies interview potential underwriters to help them prepare for a IPO. Because of this activity, bankers and other market participants are now expecting a busy second half of 2018 for IPO activity. \nEventbrite has processed more than $8 billion in gross ticket sales since it was founded in 2006. The company has raised more than $300 million since its founding from investors including Sequoia Capital, T. Rowe Price Group Inc. and Tiger Global, and has been valued at more than $1 billion, according to Wall Street Journal reports. \nUpwork is a marriage of two freelancing websites: Elance, founded in 1998, and oDesk, founded in the early 2000s. The two companies announced plans to merge in late 2013 and were renamed Upwork in 2015. They have collectively raised more than $100 million in funding from investors including T. Rowe Price, Benchmark Capital, and FirstMark Capital.",
