As previously described, the Fortuna Property is a prospective land package located in the heart of a prolific Ecuadorian mineral belt near a number of significant gold and copper discoveries made during the last 20 years.\nDue Diligence\nFollowing signing of the binding letter of intent between Lucky and Monterra on February 8, 2018 (the “LOI”), Lucky and its representatives undertook a due diligence review of Goldmindex, Monterra, and the Fortuna Property, with the intention of signing a definitive agreement following…( more )\nTo View The Full News Release Please Follow The Link Here:\nhttp://www.luckyminerals.com/lucky-minerals-provides-progress-report/\nON BEHALF OF THE BOARD\n“Robert Rosner”\nChief Executive Officer\nContact Information: For more information please contact Robert Rosner at (866) 924-6484 or info@luckyminerals.com .\nNEITHER TSX VENTURE EXCHANGE, NOR ITS REGULATION SERVICES PROVIDER (AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN THE POLICIES OF THE TSX VENTURE EXCHANGE) ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THIS RELEASE.\nSource:Lucky Minerals Inc.",
