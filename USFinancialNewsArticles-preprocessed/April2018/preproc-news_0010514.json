    "text": "Accomplished Healthcare IT Executive to Lead Technology Efforts Aimed at Aligning Stakeholders in a New Healthcare Ecosystem\nSAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- MintHealth™ a decentralized health platform-as-a-service (PaaS) that aligns health plans, provider groups, and wellness brands around patient engagement, improved clinical outcomes, and lower healthcare costs, today announced the appointment of Tyson McDowell as Chief Technology Officer, effective immediately.\nAs a senior technology executive and serial entrepreneur, McDowell brings 16 years of healthcare information technology experience and a deep background in enterprise class web-based systems for healthcare and high-engagement consumer technologies, to MintHealth. McDowell will be responsible for driving all aspects of MintHealth’s technology vision and product development. As CTO, his primary focus will be advancing the overall direction and development of MintHealth platform. Technology architecture, software development, user experience design, and data analytics will fall under McDowell’s purview.\n“Tyson’s combination of technical expertise, leadership experience, and an entrepreneurial approach make him a strong addition to our executive team. His previous work in optimizing processes within the US healthcare system and working with every stakeholder in the value chain will be invaluable to MintHealth,” said Dr. Samir Damani, CEO and co-founder of MintHealth. “As the technical evangelist for the company, Tyson will play a key role in shaping the company’s technology strategy as we embark on its next phase of developing the MintHealth platform.”\nMcDowell joins MintHealth from Lead Wingman, a venture studio he founded to incubate early stage tech companies that aim to partner humans with AI and machine learning. Prior to this, he co-founded Benchmark Revenue Management, a revenue cycle management software company, which merged with Avadyne Health in 2012. He served as CEO, CTO and President optimizing the receivables process for more than $20B in healthcare reimbursement.\nThe innovations at the core of Benchmark and Avadyne included machine learning for the prediction of Patient Portion of Payment, propensity for patients to pay (a FICO-like score) and a highly persuasive workflow engine underpinned by ROI optimization algorithms. The result was consistent double-digit gains in receivables performance. McDowell has also held several technical leadership positions at CamZone Networks, Volv Fitness, and launchbox365.\n“My experience has led me to realize the greatest technology application is the ability to drive human behaviors that impact true health outcomes. This is one area where MintHealth is uniquely positioned to have significant impact on chronic disease prevention and management, and enable consumer-driven value based care overall,” said Tyson McDowell. “I am thrilled to have the opportunity to lead the development of a transformative platform that combines blockchain, token incentives, a self-sovereign patient health record and health data exchange.”\nAbout MintHealth\nMintHealth™ is a global decentralized health platform that aligns patients, providers, and payers around patient empowerment. The platform will enable the patient to manage their own self-sovereign health identity and record, secured via blockchain, and engages the ecosystem to drive healthy patient behavior through the Vidamint™ token.\nTo learn more about MintHealth, visit: http://minthealth.io , on Medium at https://medium.com/@Mint_Health , or Telegram at https://t.me/minthealth .\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180405005372/en/\nRadix Collective for MintHealth\nNicole Jordan, 310-988-9157\nminthealth@radixcollective.com\nSource: MintHealth",
