    "text": "By Lisa Marie Segarra April 12, 2018 \nReports are circulating that “Planet X,” or Nibiru , will collide with Earth on April 23, 2018, bringing forth Doomsday, but don’t plan for the end of the world just yet. \nThe April 23rd prophecy is a hoax, and NASA has repeatedly said that Planet X isn’t real. The theory that Planet X would collide with Earth was also floated around in 2012, when some previously believed the end of the world would occur, and NASA debunked the idea at the time . NASA has noted that CalTech researchers have found evidence suggesting there could be another planet beyond Neptune (since Pluto is no longer classified as a planet). However, the existence of the maybe planet, nicknamed Planet X, is entirely theoretical at this point. \nThe same end-of-the-world-theory involving Nibiru came up in September of 2017 as well. At that time, NASA senior space scientist David Morrison told the Washington Post , “No, there’s no such thing as a planet called Nibiru. No, it’s not a brown dwarf surrounded by planets, as iterations of the claim suggest. No, it’s not on a collision course toward Earth. And yes, people should ‘get over it.'” \nThe latest Doomsday prediction for comes after Christian conspiracy theorist David Meade spoke with the Daily Express , of the United Kingdom, telling them Planet X or Nibiru will appear in the sky on April 23, triggering the start of the Rapture.
