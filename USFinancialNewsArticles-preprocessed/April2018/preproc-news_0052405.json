    "text": "(Reuters) - U.S. wireless carriers T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp are finalising terms as they seek to sign a merger deal in the next three days, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.\nA T-Mobile logo is advertised on a building sign in Los Angeles, California, U.S., May 11, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake Based on the stock exchange ratio under negotiation, T-Mobile majority-owner Deutsche Telekom will own a little over 40 percent of the combined company, but will be afforded voting control so it can consolidate the company on its books, the sources said.\nThere is always a possibility that negotiations between Deutsche Telekom and Japanâ€™s SoftBank Group Corp, the controlling shareholder of Sprint, end unsuccessfully at the last minute, the sources added. The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential.\nSprint, T-Mobile, Deutsche Telekom and SoftBank did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nReporting by Greg Roumeliotis in New York; Editing by Nick Zieminski\n ",
