    "text": "April 18, 2018 / 10:15 AM / Updated 10 minutes ago Teamsters Canada notifies Canadian Pacific of possible strike Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nApril 18 (Reuters) - Teamsters Canada said early on Wednesday it has notified Canadian Pacific Railway that workers will go on strike starting April 21 following a stalemate in negotiations between the two parties. \nTeamsters Canada, which is affiliated to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union, said it has issued railway operator Canadian Pacific with a formal 72 hours notice of intent to strike. \nCanadian Pacific was not immediately available for comment outside business hours. \nThe stand-off comes at a time when CP and rival Canadian National Railway are facing strong demand for grain shipments and other commodities. \nOn April 13, the company said it was unable to reach an agreement with two of its unions - Teamsters Canada Rail Conference â€“ Train & Engine (TCRC) and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW). \nCP had then said it was working with the union bodies to come to an agreement, adding that meeting the demands of TCRC will result in a 24 percent rise in payroll costs and IBEW's demands will cost it 25 percent higher in payroll costs, over the next three years. ( bit.ly/2Hw9QaO ) \nTeamsters Canada represents about 3,000 train conductors and engineers, while the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers is negotiating on behalf of about 360 signal maintainers.
