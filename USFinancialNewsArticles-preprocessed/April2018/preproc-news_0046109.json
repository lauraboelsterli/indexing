    "text": "JJ Redick scored 24 points and Ben Simmons added a triple-double consisting of 17 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists to carry the Philadelphia 76ers past the Miami Heat 106-102 Saturday at American Airlines Arena.\nSimmons is the fifth rookie in NBA history with a triple-double in the playoffs and the first since Magic Johnson had five in 1980.\nJoel Embiid had 14 points, 12 rebounds and five blocked shots and Dario Saric added 11 points as the Sixers took a commanding 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven series.\nDwyane Wade led the Heat with 25 points while Goran Dragic added 20. James Johnson scored 15 points and Hassan Whiteside posted a double-double of 13 points and 13 rebounds.\nThe Sixers scored the first four points of the fourth quarter to tie the game at 83, which forced Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra to call timeout. Going back to the third, the Sixers surged to a 14-0 run and an 87-83 advantage.\nTwo free throws by Robert Covington gave the Sixers a 100-94 lead with 2:10 left.\nFive straight points by Wade cut the Sixers lead to 100-99.\nThe physical nature of the game continued and the fourth double technical in two games was whistled when Saric and Whiteside each got a technical with 5:27 left in the third.\nErsan Ilyasova drained a deep 3-pointer with 1.2 seconds left and the Sixers sliced Miami’s lead to 83-79 at the end of the third.\nA wildly entertaining first half turned rather chippy with 4:27 left when Covington fouled Dragic hard, sending him to the floor. Following the foul, Johnson and Simmons were entangled and had to be separated by the referees. In addition, Embiid dove on Miami’s Josh Richardson, who spent the rest of the half in the locker room but returned after suffering a left shoulder contusion.\nJustise Winslow also went to the Heat locker room with blood dripping down his face. TNT reported that Winslow received four stitches near an eye.\nDragic led all scorers with 13 points and the Heat held a 61-56 lead at halftime.\n—Field Level Media\n 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
