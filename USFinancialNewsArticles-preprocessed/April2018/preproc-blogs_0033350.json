    "text": "Apple's iPhone has an option that will prevent it from sending you notifications while you're driving.\nIt's a safer way to drive without distractions. A recent study from EverQuote: found that 70 percent of drivers who activated the iPhone feature left it on while driving, which helped decrease phone use by 8 percent. That sounds minimal, but it can help save lives.\nActivating \"Do Not Disturb While Driving\" mode while driving is easy.\nHere's how to do it:\n- Open the Settings app on your iPhone\n- Select Control Center\n- Tap Customize Controls\n- Scroll down and tap the green \"+\" button next to Do Not Disturb While Driving\nNow turn it on:\n- Return to your iPhone home screen\n- Pull down the Control Center shade from the top-right of your iPhone X, or swipe up from the bottom of the display on any other iPhone.\n- Tap the car icon\nThis turns on Do Not Disturb While Driving whenever your phone notices it's in motion, or if it automatically connects to an in-car Bluetooth system. If someone sends you a message, they'll get an automatic response that you're in the car driving and can't reply right now.\nThis is a good idea for parents to use with teenagers who are driving and who might be otherwise prone to texting their friends.\nParents can get some additional controls by going to:\n- Open Settings\n- Tap General\n- Select Restrictions\n- Choose \"Enable Restrictions\"\n- Create a passcode\n- Choose \"Do Not Disturb While Driving\"\n- Pick \"Don't Allow Changes'\nApple says drivers will still hear alarms, emergency alerts and any timers you might have set before getting in the car.\nThere are still ways people can reach you:\n- If you have a contact marked as a \"favorite,\" such as your significant other, your phone will still ring as normal.\n- If someone calls twice in a row, suggesting there might be an emergency, your phone will still ring.\n- Also, if your iPhone knows it's connected to your car's Bluetooth or a CarPlay system, it'll route calls and texts as it normally would through your car stereo.",
