The Company is being acquired from Goldman Sachs and Vestar Capital Partners.\nHeadquartered in Downers Grove, Illinois, Hearthside produces a broad range of high-quality nutrition bars, cookies, cereals and other baked foods and snacks for some of the world's premier food brands. It operates 25 manufacturing facilities across the US and Europe and employs around 7,900 people.\nFollowing the investment, Partners Group and Charlesbank will work closely with Hearthside's management team, led by Rich Scalise, on a number of value creation initiatives.

Today, we are delighted to be welcoming Partners Group and Charlesbank as partners for the next chapter of our success story and would like to thank Goldman and Vestar for their valuable partnership over the last few years.\"\nChris Russell, Managing Director, Private Equity Americas, Partners Group, states: \"Under Rich Scalise's leadership, Hearthside has revolutionized food contract manufacturing, bringing scale to the industry. We see strong potential for the Company to continue on its growth path as its business model is supported by global transformative trends, such as increased outsourcing, which show no signs of flagging. We look forward to working with Rich and the rest of the Hearthside team.\"\nRyan Carroll, Managing Director, Charlesbank, adds: \"We are thrilled to partner with Rich and his team as they embark on the next chapter of Hearthside's growth. The track record they've established since founding the Company in 2009 is truly impressive. Further, we know from our extensive experience in the industry that Hearthside has a reputation for providing the highest levels of service and quality to its customers, many of whom have worked with the Company for years. We look forward to building on this legacy.\"\nRopes & Gray, Goodwin Procter and Latham & Watkins acted as legal advisors, KPMG and PwC as financial advisors and Jefferies as M&A advisor to Charlesbank and Partners Group.\nDavis Polk acted as legal advisor, and Barclays and Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisors to Hearthside.\nAbout Charlesbank Capital Partners\nBased in Boston and New York, Charlesbank Capital Partners is a middle-market private equity investment firm managing more than $5 billion of capital.
