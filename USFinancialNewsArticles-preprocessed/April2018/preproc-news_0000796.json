    "text": "April 2, 2018 / 10:34 AM / Updated 43 minutes ago Walmart opens first high-tech small-sized supermarket in China Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nBEIJING (Reuters) - Walmart Inc ( WMT.N ) said on Monday it has opened its first small-sized high-tech supermarket in China, which will stock products that customers will also be able buy on the U.S. retailer’s store on Chinese online marketplace JD.com ( JD.O ).

REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker/File photo \nThe move comes as “smart retail” gains popularity in China, as retailers and tech giants such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd ( BABA.N ) and Tencent Holdings Ltd ( 0700.HK ) cut deals to integrate shoppers’ online and offline experience. \nWalmart’s store, located in the southern city of Shenzhen, will stock more than 8,000 items ranging from stir-fried clams to fresh fruit, 90 percent of which will also be available online. \nItems shopped can be delivered to customers within a 2 kilometer radius as quickly as 29 minutes, said Walmart, which owns a stake in JD.com. \nWalmart said that customers at the new supermarket will be able to use a mini program on Tencent Holding Ltd’s ( 0700.HK ) WeChat as they shop, and bypass traditional checkout counters by paying via their mobile device.
