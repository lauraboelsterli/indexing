Victims showed symptoms of poisoning by chlorine and nerve agents, doctors said. \nTrump, on Twitter, condemned Sunday what he called a “mindless CHEMICAL attack,” adding: “President Putin, Russia and Iran are responsible for backing Animal Assad. Big price... ...to pay.” Washington launched a cruise-missile strike last year after a sarin-gas attack on the Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun killed nearly 100 people. Many dead, including women and children, in mindless CHEMICAL attack in Syria. Area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian Army, making it completely inaccessible to outside world. President Putin, Russia and Iran are responsible for backing Animal Assad. Big price... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 8, 2018 ....to pay. Open area immediately for medical help and verification. Another humanitarian disaster for no reason whatsoever. SICK! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 8, 2018 \nEntire families were found dead after Saturday’s attack, huddled inside apartment buildings and basements, apparently unable to escape, according to the White Helmets. Rescuers warned the death toll could rise as the search for victims — hampered by ongoing airstrikes — continued Sunday. We along with 8 other members have called for an emergency Security Council mtg tomorrow in reference to the horrible chemical weapons attack on innocent civilians in Syria. This is becoming all too common. Strong action is needed. pic.twitter.com/Vt3L5fjVla ",
