    "text": "BOTHELL, Wash., April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alder Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALDR) (“Alder” or the “Company”), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel therapeutic antibodies for the treatment of migraine, today announced that its Board of Directors has unanimously appointed Jeremy Green, Founder and Portfolio Manager of Redmile Group, LLC (“Redmile”), to the Company’s Board, effective April 25, 2018. Mr. Green will serve as a Class III director with a term expiring at the Company’s 2020 Annual Meeting, filling a vacancy on the Board.\nRedmile Group, LLC is Alder’s largest stockholder and manages approximately $3 billion in global public and private healthcare investments.\nStephen M. Dow, Chairman of the Alder Board, said “We are pleased to welcome Jeremy as a new director on our Board and his appointment serves as the latest step in our ongoing enhancement of our Board and management team. Jeremy brings strong healthcare expertise, both as an investor and a former sell-side analyst, and we look forward to benefiting from his insights and perspectives.”\nMr. Green said, “I look forward to working with the other directors and management as we continue advancing Alder’s mission to transform treatment for migraine patients.”\nAbout Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.\nAlder BioPharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on transforming the migraine treatment paradigm through the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapeutic antibodies. Alder’s lead product candidate, eptinezumab, is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that inhibits calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and is currently in late-stage clinical development for the prevention of migraine. Unlike other CGRP inhibitors, eptinezumab was specifically designed as an infusion therapy to address significant patient need. Alder is also developing ALD1910, a preclinical mAb that inhibits pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide-38 (PACAP-38) for migraine prevention.
