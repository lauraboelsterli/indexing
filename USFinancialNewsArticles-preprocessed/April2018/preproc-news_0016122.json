    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Namaste Technologies Inc. (“ Namaste ” or the “ Company ”) (CSE:N) (FRANKFURT:M5BQ) (OTCMKTS:NXTTF) is pleased to announce that the Company has signed a non-binding letter of intent (“LOI”) with 2624078 Ontario Inc., whereby Namaste would acquire 51% of the share capital of 2624078 Ontario Inc., which will undertake an application to become a Licensed Dealer (“LD”) of medical cannabis, in accordance with Health Canada regulations. Licensed dealers are authorized to perform research and development, analytical testing and conducting clinical studies with medical cannabis as well as importing medical cannabis for research purposes. The location for the LD facility is at 7 Canso Road in Etobicoke, Ontario and directly across the street from Namaste’s wholly owned subsidiary, Cannmart Inc.’s Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes (“ACMPR”) facility. The purpose of Namaste’s investment and partnership with 2624078 Ontario Inc. is to facilitate research and development of medical cannabis extracts as well as for testing of imported medical cannabis products in accordance with ACMPR guidelines. Namaste’s partnership with 2624078 Ontario Inc. reinforces Namaste’s position as a leader in the medical cannabis industry and helps ensure that it will be a first-mover in the research and production of cannabis concentrates as it anticipates a growing demand for extracts in the future.\nKey LOI Terms:\nNamaste will acquire 51% of the share capital of 2624078 Ontario Inc. Namaste and will provide debt financing of up to $750,000 CAD to complete construction of the LD facility. 2624078 Ontario Inc.’s existing management team will sign 3-year management agreements to provide operational oversight of the facility. Both parties will have 30 days from the date of execution of the LOI to negotiate terms of definitive documentation which will include a share purchase agreement and management agreements. The facility at 7 Canso Road will be constructed to meet ACMPR standards\nThe LOI and proposed share purchase agreement represent a significant milestone for Namaste in securing a facility that will facilitate the importation of unique strains of medical cannabis for testing purposes, as well as research and production of high potency cannabis extracts. If an LD license is obtained, Namaste will be able to import medical cannabis from international partners for the purpose of testing the product against ACMPR standards. In addition to providing the ability to import medical cannabis for research purposes, the LD license would also allow Namaste to begin research and development of medical cannabis extracts. Currently, the Company estimates that cannabis extract sales in the US represent over 50% of all dispensary sales. As Namaste anticipates further expansion of Canada’s legal medical cannabis platform, it expects to see significant industry trends towards these higher potency products. This LOI and the implications of obtaining an LD license for Namaste would ensure the Company’s position in what it expects to become a strong segment of the Canadian medical cannabis industry in the future.\nManagement Commentary\nDaniel Stern, President and CEO of 2624078 Ontario Inc. comments; “ We are very excited to be working with Namaste on this project. We believe that our experience in cannabis extraction technology and many years of experience in the general cannabis industry will facilitate the success of this partnership with Namaste, who we believe is a leading innovator in the Canadian medical cannabis community.”\nSean Dollinger, President and CEO of Namaste comments; “ We are very pleased to have signed this LOI as we feel confident in the future of medical cannabis extracts in the Canadian marketplace. Although high potency concentrates are not yet approved under ACMPR regulations, the LD license will provide Namaste with the opportunity to take the first steps towards not only researching and producing extracts but also engage in the process of importing medical cannabis for testing purposes. The management team of 2624078 Ontario Inc. has shown confidence in Namaste’s leadership abilities as demonstrated through our success in the industry to date. The launch of NamasteMD and our pending ACMPR sales license coupled with this LOI and the application for an LD license are important building blocks to solidify Namaste’s position as a leader in the Canadian medical cannabis industry.”\nAbout Namaste Technologies Inc.\nNamaste is the largest online retailer for medical cannabis delivery systems globally.
