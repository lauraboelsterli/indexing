    "text": "PARIS, April 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Qobuz, the European high resolution music streaming and downloading service, has named music-industry veteran Yann Miossec as its new CEO. A true music connoisseur, Miossec is a multidisciplinary-management specialist. He brings a strong background in digital music to the position, joining Qobuz after serving as an Executive Vice President for 12 years at Warner Music France. One of his first undertakings will be to lead the high-end platform's initial foray into the American market, currently scheduled for summer of 2018.\n\"Yann is a digital music visionary and a well-regarded industry statesman,\" commented Qobuz President, Denis Thebaud. \"Qobuz is entering a very exciting phase. In addition to our planned U.S. launch, the recent listing of Spotify on the New York Stock Exchange shows that the market is becoming more mature. The market is becoming segmented, which widens the opportunity for specialized players with a strong music presence and personality – like Qobuz. After our third round of fundraising ends in June, we too will likely begin considering our own IPO. With his keen business sense and music-industry experience, Yann Miossec is the best individual to successfully lead us through these crucial endeavors.\"\nQobuz is the highest resolution music streaming service in the world, providing users with the most in-depth and interactive music experience possible. It offers an extensive music catalog of 40-million tracks and is the only service to offer over one-million high-resolution tracks. Qobuz works on Mac/iOS/Android/Windows operating systems and is integrated with all of the most prestigious Hi-Fi brands.\nIn addition to passionate music lovers, the Qobuz high-end music service is aimed at two other segments of the public. 1) Art and culture enthusiasts, who are eager to enjoy a cultural vision of musical heritage. 2) Informed music lovers, who want to enjoy the best possible sound quality to satisfy their acute ears and sophisticated equipment.\nThe company has secured the rights to an entire range of major and independent record labels around the world. Content is always offered in a quality that is superior to most other platforms, at the very least in FLAC Open-Source format in 16-Bit/44.1 kHz quality, similar to CD quality, and far superior to typical Lossy (such as MP3) streaming music services.\nIt has unparalleled expertise in the field of Hi-Res music and offers music lovers a huge Hi-Res (24-Bit up to 192 kHz) catalog of one-million tracks (80,000 albums). All of it is available for either streaming or downloading, without any up-sampling or re-encoding.\nMiossec said Qobuz has always appeared to him to be one of the few platforms where the work of the team revolved around their passion for music. \"Working with this brand, promoting its projects, is my dream challenge,\" he said. \"I look forward to joining these talented, creative individuals in further developing Qobuz's presence around the world.\"\nIn addition to his time at Warner Music France, Miossec also held executive positions at other European music companies Erato and at East West France.\nHis office will be located in Qobuz's Paris headquarters.\nAbout Qobuz\nFounded in 2007, Qobuz is a French commercial online music streaming and downloading service that addresses the needs of curious and discerning music lovers across the globe.
