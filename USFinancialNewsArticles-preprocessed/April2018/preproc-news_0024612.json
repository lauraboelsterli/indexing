    "text": "LONDON, April 11 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to ask her cabinet of ministers on Thursday to approve Britainâ€™s involvement in military action against Syrian chemical weapons infrastructure, Sky News said.\nBritain was preparing to participate in action led by France and the United States, Sky News said on Wednesday.\nEarlier, the BBC said May would not seek prior parliamentary approval for joining military action because she favoured taking action soon.
