(NASDAQ: AMKR), a leading provider of semiconductor packaging and test services, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n\"First quarter results were in line with expectations, with sales up 14% year-on-year,\" said Steve Kelley, Amkor's president and chief executive officer. \"We benefited from our strategic focus on balanced revenue growth across end markets and regions. Increased participation in all major smartphone ecosystems, together with gains in computing and automotive, were the key growth drivers in Q1 2018.\"\nResults Q1 2018 Q4 2017 Q1 2017 ($ in millions, except per share data) Net sales $1,025 $1,150 $899 Gross margin 15.4% 19.5% 15.1% Net income (loss) attributable to Amkor 1 $10 $100 ($15) Earnings per diluted share 1 $0.04 $0.42 ($0.06) EBITDA 1,2 $175 $254 $149 1) Q4 2017 net income includes an estimated one-time net tax benefit of $42 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, primarily due to the reversal of a valuation allowance on certain U.S. deferred tax assets related to U.S. tax reform.\n2) EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. The reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measure is included below under \"Selected Operating Data.\"\n\"Operating margin, net income and EBITDA all showed solid gains year-on-year,\" said Megan Faust, Amkor’s corporate vice president and chief financial officer. \"Profitability improved due to healthy sales growth, despite an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 120 bps on gross margin compared to Q1 2017.\"\nCash and cash equivalents were $495 million and total debt was $1.3 billion, at March 31, 2018.\nNew Accounting Standards\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), utilizing the full retrospective transition method. The prior periods presented here have been revised to reflect this change.\nBusiness Outlook\n\"We expect second quarter 2018 revenues to be around $1.03 billion, up 2% year-on-year,\" said Kelley. \"The smartphone market is expected to remain somewhat muted in Q2, while demand in our other end markets is solid.\"\nSecond quarter 2018 outlook (unless otherwise noted):\nNet sales of $990 million to $1.07 billion Gross margin of 14% to 16% Net loss of $4 million to net income of $24 million, or ($0.02) to $0.10 per diluted share Full year capital expenditures of approximately $600 million\nConference Call Information\nAmkor will conduct a conference call on Thursday, April 26, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

We define EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization. We believe EBITDA to be relevant and useful information to our investors because it provides additional information in assessing our financial operating results. Our management uses EBITDA in evaluating our operating performance, our ability to service debt and our ability to fund capital expenditures. However, EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not reflect the impact of certain expenses on our consolidated statements of income, including interest expense, which is a necessary element of our costs because we have borrowed money in order to finance our operations, income tax expense, which is a necessary element of our costs because taxes are imposed by law, and depreciation and amortization, which is a necessary element of our costs because we use capital assets to generate income. EBITDA should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, operating income, net income or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Furthermore our definition of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Below is our reconciliation of EBITDA to U.S. GAAP net income.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliation: Q1 2018 Q4 2017 Q1 2017 (in millions) EBITDA Data: Net income $ 10 $ 101 $ (14 ) Plus: Interest expense 20 20 22 Plus: Income tax expense (benefit) 2 (14 ) (1 ) Plus: Depreciation & amortization 143 147 142 EBITDA $ 175 $ 254 $ 149 AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(Unaudited)\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (In thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 1,025,319 $ 899,284 Cost of sales 867,548 763,050 Gross profit 157,771 136,234 Selling, general and administrative 80,723 76,282 Research and development 40,929 41,568 Total operating expenses 121,652 117,850 Operating income 36,119 18,384 Interest expense 20,011 21,254 Interest expense, related party — 1,242 Other (income) expense, net 3,432 11,181 Total other expense, net 23,443 33,677 Income (loss) before taxes 12,676 (15,293 ) Income tax expense (benefit) 2,481 (1,325 ) Net income (loss) 10,195 (13,968 ) Net income attributable to non-controlling interests (651 ) (818 ) Net income (loss) attributable to Amkor $ 9,544 $ (14,786 ) Net income (loss) attributable to Amkor per common share: Basic $ 0.04 $ (0.06 ) Diluted $ 0.04 $ (0.06 ) Shares used in computing per common share amounts: Basic 239,214 238,685 Diluted 239,816 238,685 AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 (In thousands) ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 495,183 $ 596,364 Restricted cash 2,000 2,000 Accounts receivable, net of allowances 734,953 798,264 Inventories 228,611 213,649 Other current assets 30,837 33,727 Total current assets 1,491,584 1,644,004 Property, plant and equipment, net 2,727,878 2,695,065 Goodwill 26,546 25,036 Restricted cash 3,661 4,487 Other assets 142,041 139,796 Total assets $ 4,391,710 $ 4,508,388 LIABILITIES AND EQUITY Current liabilities: Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt $ 105,451 $ 123,848 Trade accounts payable 527,910 569,085 Capital expenditures payable 223,312 294,258 Accrued expenses 311,408 330,868 Total current liabilities 1,168,081 1,318,059 Long-term debt 1,240,141 1,240,581 Pension and severance obligations 191,180 182,216 Other non-current liabilities 45,234 47,823 Total liabilities 2,644,636 2,788,679 Stockholders’ equity: Preferred stock — — Common stock 285 285 Additional paid-in capital 1,905,666 1,903,357 Accumulated deficit (4,359 ) (13,903 ) Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 37,571 22,519 Treasury stock (216,038 ) (215,982 ) Total Amkor stockholders’ equity 1,723,125 1,696,276 Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries 23,949 23,433 Total equity 1,747,074 1,719,709 Total liabilities and equity $ 4,391,710 $ 4,508,388 AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(Unaudited)\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (In thousands) Cash flows from operating activities: Net income (loss) $ 10,195 $ (13,968 ) Depreciation and amortization 142,509 141,816 Other operating activities and non-cash items (4,734 ) (9,653 ) Changes in assets and liabilities (339 ) (15,518 ) Net cash provided by operating activities 147,631 102,677 Cash flows from investing activities: Payments for property, plant and equipment (230,603 ) (88,285 ) Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment 342 1,835 Other investing activities 656 (2,492 ) Net cash used in investing activities (229,605 ) (88,942 ) Cash flows from financing activities: Proceeds from short-term debt — 13,275 Payments of short-term debt (17,352 ) (14,073 ) Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt — 50,000 Payments of long-term debt (6,220 ) (3,295 ) Payment of deferred consideration for purchase of facility — (3,890 ) Payments of capital lease obligations (808 ) (913 ) Other financing activities 455 (356 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (23,925 ) 40,748 Effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 3,892 10,259 Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (102,007 ) 64,742 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, beginning of period 602,851 555,495 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, end of period $ 500,844 $ 620,237 Forward-Looking Statement Disclaimer\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws.
