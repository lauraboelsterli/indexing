He is currently touring the United States seeking investments to help broaden the economy and lessen its dependence on oil.\nSaudi Arabians are avid consumers of Western media and culture. Despite the cinema ban, Hollywood films and recent television series are widely watched at home and discussed.\nAMC's first cinema will be located in the King Abdullah Financial District in a building originally intended to be a symphony concert hall, AMC Chief Executive Adam Aron said in an interview. The main theatre will have about 500 leather seats, orchestra and balcony levels and marble bathrooms, he said. Three more screens will be added by mid-summer.\n\"We think it's going to be the prettiest movie theatre in the world,\" Aron said. \"It's a dramatic building.\"\nTo serve a population of more than 32 million, most of whom are under the age of 30, Saudi Arabia wants to set up around 350 cinemas with over 2,500 screens by 2030, which it hopes will attract nearly $1 billion in annual ticket sales.\n\"The restoration of cinemas will ... help boost the local economy by increasing household spending on entertainment while supporting job creation in the Kingdom,\" Culture and Information Minister Awwad Alawwad said in a statement.\nAMC is partnering with the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Saudi Arabia's main sovereign wealth fund.\nA handful of other theatre operators are ready to build in Saudi Arabia if they win clearance, John Fithian, president of the U.S.-based National Association of Theatre Owners, told reporters.\nFithian said he met government officials in Riyadh in December to work out issues such as what type of material would be permitted on movie screens. He said he believes most Hollywood movies will be allowed, though some will require editing.\nAMC's Aron said he expects the same versions of films shown in Dubai or Kuwait will be suitable for Saudi Arabia. \"Hollywood has long ago dealt with the sensitivities of the Middle East and have adjusted film product accordingly,\" he said. \"Major Hollywood studios are showing films all over the Middle East.\"\nSeparately, Six Flags Entertainment said it planned to develop a theme park in Riyadh with PIF. Cirque du Soleil will stage its first performance in the country on Sept. 23, according to a statement from the General Entertainment Authority.\nThe GEA also said it reached a deal for other live shows such as \"Disney on Ice.\" (Reporting by Lisa Richwine in Los Angeles and Stephen Kalin in Riyadh Editing by Diane Craft and Leslie Adler)",
