Subscribe to WSJ Pro Cybersecurity for in-depth coverage on cybersecurity trends, breaches and best practices. Good morning, CIOs. Systems often don’t get the attention they deserve until they fail. Does this assessment, offered by David A. Powner, director of information technology management issues at the United States Government Accountability office, strike a chord? He made the comment to CIO Journal’s Angus Loten in reference to Tuesday’s IRS systems failure, but the tendency to let systems slide into disrepair extends well beyond federal IT.\nThe hardware failure that delayed filing highlights the risks for CIOs struggling with aging backend IT systems, tight budgets and growing pressure to provide innovative front-end services, according to Mr. Loten. “For the IRS this was a mission-critical system that processes most of our $3.3 trillion in taxes every year,” Mr. Powner, told CIO Journal. “But we still don’t see a definite plan to get it into shape.”\nThe agency’s legacy hardware systems are programmed with assembly language, a computer language initially used in the 1950s, Mr. Powner said. This includes the agency’s Individual Master File, or IMF, its main computer system for data on individual taxpayer accounts, he added. It is the computer system underpinning the agency’s modernized e-file system, which taxpayers use to file returns online, he said.\nDespite recent federal IT modernization efforts, officials across the federal government tend to shy away from overhauling backend systems that remain operational, Mr. Powner said. That means systems often don’t get the attention they need until they fail, he said.\nCLOUD \nA view of a the Seljalandsfoss Waterfall in Rangarping eystra, Iceland. Getty Images Iceland takes hard look at tech boom. Lawmakers worry a proliferation of data centers is threatening the environment and tourism, the Journal’s Zeke Turner reports . Icelandic data centers are projected to use about 125 megawatts of capacity total by the end of 2018, more than all the homes in Iceland and a 300% increase since last year, according to KPMG.\nIt’s the water! Iceland’s big competitive advantage is its 100% emissions-free power, which comes exclusively from hydroelectric dams and geothermal wells. Its relatively consistent, cool temperatures are also just right for data centers to use free-air cooling.\nMORE TECHNOLOGY NEWS \nA server rack at Facebook’s data center in Prineville, Ore. FACEBOOK/EPA/SHUTTERSTOCK Facebook plans to build its own chips. Facebook is planning to design chips that could power its data centers, artificial intelligence software and various consumer devices, including virtual-reality headsets, the WSJ’s Deepa Seetharaman reports . Other tech giants have gone the same route, including Alphabet Inc. ’s Google, which developed its own microprocessor chips to advance its work in AI and other features and Apple Inc. , currently building chips for its devices. Although Facebook’s core strength is in developing software services, it has played a key role in making data centers more efficient, designing and building its own servers .\nAmazon Prime has more than 100 million members. CEO Jeff Bezos revealed the number Wednesday in his annual letter to shareholders, the Journal’s Austen Hufford and Georgia Wells report . Launched 13 years ago, the $99-a-year Prime service gives customers free, unlimited two-day shipping, access to free music and videos, and other perks. Last year Amazon brought in $9.72 billion in revenue directly from subscription services, including fees from Prime members.\nRussia hits cloud in tackling Telegram. With the encrypted messaging app maker refusing to help Russia’s security services access its user data, the government is attempting to ban it. This week, in its effort to shut Telegram down, the country’s communications watchdog targeted Google and Amazon clouds used by the app, stopping access to more than 16 million IP addresses. The app emerged unscathed. Companies which lost business because of the blackout are considering legal action, but that may be hopeful thinking. Privacy advocates tell the FT that the action may represent a step by the Kremlin towards establishing an government-controlled internet regime similar to China’s.\nWhy tech titans are betting on India. Inexpensive smartphones and dirt-cheap data plans have at last made getting online affordable to most Indians, the WSJ reports .
