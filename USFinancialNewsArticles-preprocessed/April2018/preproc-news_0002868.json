    "text": "NEW DELHI, April 2 (Reuters) - India has imposed a 10 percent tax on imports of key smartphone components including populated printed circuit boards, which are at the heart of smartphones, according to a government document.\nThe Indian government's move on Monday confirmed a Reuters report here from last week that the country was exploring new duties on the imports of populated printed circuit boards that include components such as processors, memory and wireless chips.\nA 10 percent customs tax was also imposed on the imports of camera modules for phones and connectors.\nThe move, part of a phased manufacturing plan for lifting local production of mobile devices, is aimed at boosting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s flagship ‘Make In India’ drive to turn the country into a manufacturing hub, like neighbouring China.
