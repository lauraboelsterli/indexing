French cosmetics group L'Oreal is seen on a sales counter at a department store in Paris April 20, 2015 REUTERS/Charles Platiau/File Photo \nThe world’s biggest cosmetics firm said sales between January and March reached 6.78 billion euros ($1.23 billion), a touch above the 6.75 billion euros forecast by analysts polled by Inquiry Financial for Reuters. \nLike-for-like revenue growth, which strips out the effect of currency swings and acquisitions or disposals, was 6.8 percent, well above expectations of 5.6 percent. \nOn a reported basis, revenue was down 1 percent from a year earlier, L’Oreal said, as currency effects bit due to a strong euro.
