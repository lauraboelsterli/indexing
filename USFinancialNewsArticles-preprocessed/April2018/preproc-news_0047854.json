    "text": "NEW YORK, April 25 (Reuters) - SL Green Realty Corp, a major New York landlord, said on Wednesday law firm McDermott Will & Emery LLP signed a 20-year lease at One Vanderbilt, a 1,401-foot (427-meter) office tower going up next to Grand Central Terminal in Midtown Manhattan.\nMcDermott agreed to take 105,539 square feet of space on floors 44-46 and 67 in the $3.1 billion tower, whose planned opening in 2020 will herald the rejuvenation of the East Midtown office district, where buildings on average are 85 years old.\nOne Vanderbilt is now 31 percent leased and on track to meet SL Green’s goal of being 37 percent leased by year end, the real estate investment trust (REIT) said in a statement.\nThe tower, a column-free structure with extra-high ceilings and unobstructed glass siding, occupies an entire city block immediately west of Grand Central, a key transportation hub in the city that is adding a new train line from Long Island.\nOne Vanderbilt will have direct connections to the transit network and SL Green is funding $220 million of infrastructure upgrades to the system.\nCity officials last August approved the rezoning of a 78-block swath surrounding Grand Central that will allow for new construction and higher office towers in exchange for funding improved access to the Manhattan’s aging subway system.\nReporting by Herbert Lash; Editing by Steve Orlofsky\n ",
