    "text": "(Corrects assets under management to $251.7 billion from $251.7 million in paragraph 5)\nApril 26 (Reuters) - Lazard Ltd posted a better-than-expected first-quarter profit on Thursday as a rise in global deal making helped its financial advisory business, while its asset management business gained from a booming stock market.\nRevenue from financial advisory business, which includes M&A advisory, rose 15.8 percent as it closed several high-profile deals, including U.S. power generator Calpine Corp’s $17.1 billion sale to a consortium led by private equity firm Energy Capital Partners.\nThe company had a market share of 11.2 percent for completed deals globally in the latest quarter, making it the seventh biggest adviser, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nLazard’s asset management business also grew at a rapid clip in the quarter, accounting for 45.6 percent of the total operating revenue.\nAssets under management increased 17 percent to $251.7 billion, driven by net inflows across global and emerging markets equities and fixed income.\nTotal revenue jumped 20.5 percent to $768.2 million, while provision for income taxes fell 39.2 percent due to the U.S. tax reforms.\nThe company said in the fourth quarter it was reviewing whether to convert into a “C Corporation” from its current status as a public partnership after changes to the U.S. tax code.\nNet income attributable to Lazard rose to $159.7 million, or $1.21 per share, in the quarter ended March 31 from $107.6 million, or 81 cents per share, a year earlier.\nOn an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.26 per share, beating analysts’ estimates of $1.04, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nReporting By Aparajita Saxena in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva\n ",
