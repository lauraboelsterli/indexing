    "text": "April 6, 2018 / 11:43 PM / Updated an hour ago Golf-Daly hurts knee after collision near Augusta course Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nAUGUSTA, Ga., April 6 (Reuters) - John Daly was slightly injured when a car collided with his motor home near Augusta National on Friday, the two-times major champion told a local television station. \nDaly said a small car was making a U-turn when it veered off Washington Road and into his vehicle, which is parked for the week outside a local restaurant on the busy thoroughfare less than a mile from the home of the Masters. \nThe 51-year-old Daly, who is not playing in the tournament but in the area selling merchandise to golf fans, described the incident as “scary”. \n“We were just sitting here selling some goods,” Daly told WRDW. “She (the driver of the car) ended up running over the fence and ran right through the bus. I moved and twisted my knee. It’s swelled up.” \nDaly said he would have an MRI on his knee to ascertain the extent of the injury. \nVideo footage of the bus showed only minor damage.
