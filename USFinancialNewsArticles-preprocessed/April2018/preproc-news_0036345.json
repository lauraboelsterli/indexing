File Photo: A VW logo is seen in front of the main building of the Volkswagen brand at the Volkswagen headquarters during a media tour to present Volkswagen's so called \"Blaue Fabrik\" (Blue Factory) environmental program, in Wolfsburg, Germany May 19, 2017. REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer/Files \nVolkswagen aims to sell up to 25 percent of the business as part of the listing and keep a majority, the magazine said. Sources told Reuters earlier this week that Volkswagen is planning to list the division in the first quarter of next year. \nVolkswagen was not immediately available for comment. \n($1 = 0.8121 euros)",
