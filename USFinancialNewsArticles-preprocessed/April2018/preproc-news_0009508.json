    "text": "BAGHDAD, April 4 (Reuters) - Iraq is still in discussion with Exxon Mobil over a multi-billion-dollar project to boost output from several southern oilfields, the Iraqi oil ministry said on Wednesday.\nThe project was discussed again in Baghdad by Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi and a senior executive from Exxon Mobil in charge of extractive projects, Brad Carson, the ministry said in a statement.\nThe statement cited Carson as saying Exxon hopes to reach a final agreement over the project.\nThe “Integrated South Project” consists of building oil pipelines, storage facilities and a seawater supply project to inject water from the Gulf into the Luhais, Nassiriya, Tuba, Nahr Bin Umar and Artawi oilfields to boost oil recovery.
