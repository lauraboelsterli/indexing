    "text": "LONDON, April 11 (Reuters) - Tesco beat guidance with a 28.4 percent rise in full-year profit on Wednesday, underlining the recovery of Britain’s biggest retailer under Chief Executive Dave Lewis.\nThe supermarket group, which last month completed the 4 billion pounds ($5.7 billion) purchase of wholesaler Booker, made an operating profit before exceptional items of 1.644 billion pounds in the year to Feb. 24, 2018. That compared to Tesco’s guidance of “at least” 1.575 billion pounds and 1.28 billion pounds made in 2016-17.\nTesco said it was firmly on track to deliver its medium-term targets.\nReporting by James Davey; editing by Kate Holton\n ",
