REUTERS/Bria Webb Cui did not respond to reporters questions on arrival. State Department officials said the meeting had been set up before the United States announced new tariffs on Chinese products on Tuesday, a move that provoked Chinese retaliation.\nA U.S. trade official said on Wednesday that the United States and China may pursue negotiations to resolve deepening differences over trade, but he declined to say whether any new high-level meetings were planned.\nReporting by Lesley Wroughton and David Brunnstrom; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ",
