The completion of the merger is also subject to obtaining antitrust clearances from China’s Ministry of Commerce, the Japan Fair Trade Commission, Taiwan Fair Trade Commission, Philippine Competition Commission, German Federal Cartel Office and Federal Competition Authority in Austria, each of which continues to review the transaction. Completion of the merger also remains subject to certain other closing conditions, including approval by Microsemi stockholders. Assuming the timely receipt of the aforementioned regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of the other closing conditions, Microchip anticipates that the merger will be completed in June 2018.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this release, including those relating to obtaining antitrust clearances from China’s Ministry of Commerce, the Japan Fair Trade Commission, Taiwan Fair Trade Commission, Philippine Competition Commission, German Federal Cartel Office and Federal Competition Authority in Austria, satisfaction of closing conditions, approval by Microsemi stockholders, and the expected timing of such antitrust approvals and satisfaction of closing conditions are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
