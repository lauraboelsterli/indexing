REUTERS/David Gray 0800 SCOTLAND’S WALLACE ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT AGED 24 \nScottish swimmer Daniel Wallace has announced his retirement at the age of 24, saying he had achieved everything he had wanted to in the sport. \nWallace won bronze medals in the 4x100m and 4x200m freestyle relay teams at this year’s Games, adding to his World Championships relay gold in 2015, Olympic relay silver in 2016 and individual gold and silver medals at the 2014 Glasgow Games. \n“It was amazing to win two medals at my last Games, my last competition ever,” Wallace told BBC Scotland. “It was obviously a goal of mine to come away with a medal or two, so I’m really happy I’ve done that. \n“I’d done everything I wanted to do within the sport so it was just about enjoying the last moments, the last Games, and the last chance to represent Scotland...,” he added. \n“Performance-wise I achieved way more than I ever wanted to do. I went from a boy to being a man, and hopefully did a lot of people proud.” 0730 UGANDA THUMP SCOTLAND BUT FAIL TO MAKE SEMIS \nThe Ugandan women’s netball team, who made their Games debut this year, outclassed Scotland 57-37 in the final Pool B match but failed to make it to the semi-finals.
