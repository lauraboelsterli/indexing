It is a runners-up prize. I didn’t come here for that,” Charig told BBC Sport. “I don’t get up early, and go training and work so hard to perform like that.” 0800 WOMEN’S RUGBY SEVENS GETS UNDERWAY \nWomen’s rugby sevens is making it’s Games bow this year and hosts Australia have got their campaign off to a flying start with a 34-5 thumping of Wales, while England beat Fiji 17-5. \nNew Zealand thrashed Kenya 45-0. 0630 AUSTRALIAN SCANLAN WINS WOMEN’S TRAP FINAL \nAustralian shooter Laetisha Scanlan, who is celebrating her 28th birthday on Friday, set a Games record by hitting 38 out of 50 targets to defend her title in the women’s trap final. \nNorthern Ireland’s Kirsty Barr hit one target fewer to take silver while Wales’ Sarah Wixey won bronze. 0520 TEAM INDIA TO APPEAL SUSPENSION OF TWO ATHLETES \nTeam India will appeal the Commonwealth Games Federation’s decision to expel two of its athletes for breaching the Games’‘no-needles’ policy. \n“They have taken action against two athletes, which we do not agree with at all, and we will appeal against the decision,” Indian officials told a media conference. “Basically there is a lot of confusion around the whole episode.” \n0430 ANISH ADDS TO INDIA’s SHOOTING DOMINANCE Diving - Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games - Men's Synchronised 10m Platform Final - Optus Aquatic Centre - Gold Coast, Australia - April 13, 2018.
