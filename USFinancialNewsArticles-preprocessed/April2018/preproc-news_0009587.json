    "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C., April 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Mallard Creek Polymers, Inc. (MCP) experts understand the challenges that companies are facing when creating the next formulation. The sales and R&D people in MCP work hand-in-hand with formulation chemists, operations staff, and purchasing to acquire and/or design synthetic emulsion polymers to meet specific needs identified by a potential customer. By combining a deep understanding of coatings technology, cross-fertilization from other application segments, a strong product portfolio, and strategic acquisitions the company can react quickly to changing and demanding requirements.\nThe company has recently announced new grades with cement compatibility, Rovene ® 6521, Rovene ® 6525, and Tylac ® 4194, that can be used in many challenging coating and membrane applications. BarrierPro ® 4551 is the newest styrene-butadiene latex product designed specifically for the liquid applied membrane market. This product has been built based on the company's 20-year leadership in this market, due to a strategic acquisition made in 2008. Rovene ® 4011 is the latest SBR introduced for water resistant coating applications.\nMCP recently announced new technology based on Intellectual Property from Ecronova Polymer GmbH. The portfolio of products and chemistry from this IP will greatly enhance our offering to the Paint and Coatings industry, specifically providing MCP many products focused on architectural coatings.
