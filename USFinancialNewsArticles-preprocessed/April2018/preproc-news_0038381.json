    "text": "TINTON FALLS, N.J., April 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Two River Bancorp (Nasdaq:TRCB) (the \"Company\"), the parent company of Two River Community Bank (the \"Bank\") , today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, highlighted by record first quarter net income and earnings per diluted share driven by 10.1% annualized loan growth and continued solid asset quality.\n2018 First Quarter Financial Highlights\n(comparisons to respective prior year’s period)\nNet income increased 48.5% to $2.68 million Earnings per diluted share (EPS) increased 47.6% to $0.31 Return on average assets of 1.04%, up from 0.76% Return on average equity of 10.08%, up from 7.18% Net interest margin improved 18 basis points to 3.63% Net interest income increased 15.3% to $8.80 million Non-interest income increased 16.4% to $1.31 million\n(Totals at March 31, 2018; comparisons to December 31, 2017)\nTotal loans were $872.3 million, an increase of $21.5 million, or 10.1% annualized Total deposits were $870.9 million, an increase of $9.3 million, or 4.3% annualized Total assets increased to a record $1.042 billion, compared to $1.040 billion Tangible book value per share (1) increased to $10.66, compared to $10.44\nManagement Commentary\nWilliam D. Moss, President and CEO, stated, “We achieved record bottom line results and solid improvement in all key performance metrics during the first quarter. Total loan growth increased by over 10% annualized, despite the sale of a $5.0 million pool of portfolio residential adjustable rate mortgages. The growth in our commercial loan sector originated from a wide range of office, industrial, and residential lending sources without any significant product concentration. On an annualized basis, C&I and construction lending grew over 20% in the first quarter, driven by local relationships and subsequent referrals in our markets. The first quarter volume of loan closings and sizable pipeline will continue to support our performance for the balance of the year.”\nDividend Information\nOn April 18, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.045 per share, payable May 30, 2018 to shareholders of record as of May 11, 2018, which marks the 21 st consecutive quarterly cash dividend paid by the Company to its shareholders.\n(1) Non-GAAP Financial Information.

The increase was due primarily to higher net interest income and non-interest income, coupled with a $90,000 tax benefit related to the accounting treatment of equity-based compensation, along with a lower corporate tax rate.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $8.80 million, an increase of 15.3% compared to $7.63 million in the corresponding prior year period. This was largely due to an increase of $87.9 million, or 9.8%, in average interest earning assets, primarily driven from growth in the Company’s loan portfolio.\nNet Interest Margin\nThe Company reported a net interest margin of 3.63% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to the 3.56% reported in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 3.45% reported in the first quarter of 2017. The net interest margin improvement of 7 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily the result of higher yielding interest-earning assets.\nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 totaled $1.31 million, an increase of $185,000, or 16.4%, compared to the same period in 2017. This was largely the result of a $214,000, or 182.9%, increase in gains on the sale of SBA loans. For the first quarter of 2018, mortgage banking revenue was $338,000, which included a $100,000 gain from the sale of a pool of residential adjustable rate mortgages, compared to $426,000 in the corresponding period in 2017, which included a $91,000 gain from the sale of a pool of residential adjustable rate mortgages. The Company experienced a slowdown in residential lending activity partially due to a prolonged winter that led to a late start to the spring housing market, coupled with tighter competition for purchase transactions.\nNon-Interest Expense\nNon-interest expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 totaled $6.23 million, an increase of $450,000, or 7.8%, compared to the same period in 2017, mainly due to higher salaries and benefits resulting from annual merit increases, along with new hires within the lending and deposit teams.\nProvision / Allowance for Loan Losses\nDuring the quarter, the Company reported a $400,000 provision for loan losses, compared to $225,000 in the prior year period. The increase was largely due to the strong loan growth during the period. The Company had $106,000 in net loan charge-offs during the quarter, compared to $223,000 of net loan charge offs in the same period last year.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company's allowance for loan losses was $10.96 million, compared to $10.67 million at December 31, 2017. The loss allowance as a percentage of total loans was 1.26% at March 31, 2018, compared to 1.25% at December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Condition / Balance Sheet\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company maintained capital ratios that were in excess of regulatory standards for well-capitalized institutions. The Company's Tier 1 capital to average assets ratio was 8.88%, common equity Tier 1 to risk weighted assets ratio was 9.73%, Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets ratio was 9.73%, and total capital to risk weighted assets ratio was 11.96%.\nTotal assets as of March 31, 2018 were $1.042 billion, compared to $1.040 billion at December 31, 2017 and $967.1 million at March 31, 2017.\nTotal loans as of March 31, 2018 grew to $872.3 million, compared to $850.9 million reported at December 31, 2017 and $762.7 million at March 31, 2017. This loan growth was funded primarily by a combination of deposit growth and excess cash on hand.\nTotal deposits as of March 31, 2018 grew to $870.9 million, compared to $861.6 million as of December 31, 2017 and $799.7 million at March 31, 2017. Core checking deposits at March 31, 2018 were $375.9 million, compared to $400.0 million at December 31, 2017 and $344.5 million at March 31, 2017. The Company continues to focus on building core checking account deposit relationships, which can vary from quarter to quarter due to seasonality in municipal relationships.\nAsset Quality\nThe Company's non-performing assets at March 31, 2018 were $1.97 million, compared to $2.07 million at December 31, 2017 and $1.77 million at March 31, 2017. Non-performing assets to total assets at March 31, 2018 were 0.19%, compared to 0.20% at December 31, 2017 and 0.18% at March 31, 2017.\nNon-accrual loans were $1.97 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $2.07 million at December 31, 2017 and $1.77 million at March 31, 2017. There was no OREO at both March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, compared to $259,000 at March 31, 2017.\nTroubled debt restructured loan balances amounted to $6.84 million at March 31, 2018, with all but $878,000 performing. This compared to $7.05 million at December 31, 2017 and $8.16 million at March 31, 2017.\nAbout the Company\nTwo River Bancorp is the holding company for Two River Community Bank, which is headquartered in Tinton Falls, New Jersey.

These non-GAAP financial measures are \"tangible book value per common share,\" \"return on average tangible assets,\" and \"return on average tangible equity.\" This non-GAAP disclosure has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Our management uses these non-GAAP measures in its analysis of our performance because it believes these measures are material and will be used as a measure of our performance by investors.\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nAs of and for the Three Months Ended March 31, Dec. 31, Sept. 30, June 30, March 31, 2018 2017 2017 2017 2017 Total shareholders' equity $ 108,980 $ 106,571 $ 106,567 $ 104,524 $ 102,406 Less: goodwill and other tangibles (18,109 ) (18,109 ) (18,109 ) (18,109 ) (18,109 ) Tangible common shareholders’ equity $ 90,871 $ 88,462 $ 88,458 $ 86,415 $ 84,297 Common shares outstanding 8,525 8,470 8,454 8,429 8,389 Book value per common share $ 12.78 $ 12.58 $ 12.60 $ 12.40 $ 12.21 Book value per common share $ 12.78 $ 12.58 $ 12.60 $ 12.40 $ 12.21 Effect of intangible assets (2.12 ) (2.14 ) (2.14 ) (2.15 ) (2.16 ) Tangible book value per common share $ 10.66 $ 10.44 $ 10.46 $ 10.25 $ 10.05 Return on average assets 1.04 % 0.13 % 0.89 % 0.87 % 0.76 % Effect of average intangible assets 0.02 % - 0.02 % 0.01 % 0.01 % Return on average tangible assets 1.06 % 0.13 % 0.91 % 0.88 % 0.77 % Return on average equity 10.08 % 1.24 % 8.39 % 8.26 % 7.18 % Effect of average intangible assets 2.04 % 0.25 % 1.74 % 1.75 % 1.56 % Return on average tangible equity 12.12 % 1.49 % 10.13 % 10.01 % 8.74 %\nSource: Two River Bancorp",
