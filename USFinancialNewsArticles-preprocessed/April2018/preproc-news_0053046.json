    "text": "First quarter 2018 highlights, versus first quarter 2017:\nNet sales of $214.6 million, up 5.3% Gross margin of 35.7%, down 373 basis points Net income of $26.1 million, down 3.3% Earnings of $1.40 per diluted share; adjusted earnings of $1.48 per diluted share\nCHANDLER, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Rogers Corporation (NYSE:ROG) today announced financial results for the 2018 first quarter.\nThe Company reported 2018 first quarter net sales of $214.6 million, which was within the Company's previously announced guidance of $208 to $218 million, compared to 2017 first quarter net sales of $203.8 million. Currency exchange rates favorably impacted 2018 first quarter net sales by $9.4 million due to strengthening in the Euro, Renminbi and Korean Won.\nEarnings for the 2018 first quarter were $1.40 per diluted share, compared to $1.47 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017. Earnings per diluted share were above the Company's guidance of $1.15 to $1.30. On an adjusted basis, earnings were $1.48 per diluted share, compared to adjusted earnings of $1.68 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted earnings were above the Company's guidance of $1.30 to $1.45 per diluted share.\nFirst quarter 2018 net income was $26.1 million, compared to $27.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $41.4 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $54.3 million reported in the first quarter of 2017.\nGross margin was 35.7% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 39.4% in the first quarter of 2017. Operating margin was 14.5% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 19.2% in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted operating margin was 15.4% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 22.0% in the first quarter of 2017.\n\"Strong growth in our Advanced Mobility markets, especially EV/HEV and ADAS, were highlights in the quarter. This strength was offset by lower demand in wireless infrastructure as the market transitions to 5G technology,” stated Bruce D. Hoechner, Rogers' President and CEO. \"Revenue mix and operational challenges largely in the Advanced Connectivity Solutions business were the primary factors contributing to our lower than anticipated margin performance during Q1. Our actions to resolve these operational issues, as well as the strong outlook in our key markets, give us confidence in our ability to achieve our 2020 objectives.\"\nBusiness segment discussion\nAdvanced Connectivity Solutions (ACS)\nAdvanced Connectivity Solutions reported 2018 first quarter net sales of $73.5 million, a 6.5% decrease compared to 2017 first quarter net sales of $78.5 million. The decrease in 2018 first quarter net sales was largely driven by lower demand in wireless 4G LTE, portable electronics and satellite TV applications, partially offset by continued strength in demand for automotive advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) revenues. First quarter 2018 net sales were favorably impacted by $1.8 million due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nElastomeric Material Solutions (EMS)\nElastomeric Material Solutions reported 2018 first quarter net sales of $78.1 million, a 1.6% increase compared to 2017 first quarter net sales of $76.9 million. EMS net sales increased on higher demand in portable electronics, general industrial and electric and hybrid electric vehicles, partially offset by lower demand in mass transit and other applications. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates favorably impacted net sales by $2.0 million in the 2018 first quarter.\nPower Electronics Solutions (PES)\nPower Electronics Solutions reported 2018 first quarter net sales of $57.7 million, a 35.3% increase compared to 2017 first quarter net sales of $42.7 million. 2018 first quarter net sales increased due to broad based demand across markets, including particular strength in electric and hybrid electric vehicles, renewable energy and laser diode coolers. First quarter 2018 net sales were favorably impacted by $5.3 million due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nOther\nOther reported 2018 first quarter net sales of $5.4 million, a decrease of 7.3% compared to the first quarter of 2017 sales of $5.8 million.\nBalance sheet and other highlights\nCash position\nRogers ended the first quarter of 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $173.0 million, a decrease of $8.1 million from $181.2 million at December 31, 2017. The primary drivers of the lower cash balance were capital spending of $9.1 million, tax payments related to vested equity awards of $6.4 million, and share repurchases of $3.0 million, partially offset by $8.8 million of net cash provided by operating activities.\nCash flow\nNet cash provided from operating activities of $8.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, a decrease compared to $23.2 million in 2017. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by the use of working capital. Capital spending was $9.1 million in 2018, an increase compared to $5.3 million in 2017.\nEffective tax rate\nRogers' effective income tax rate was 15.4% and 32.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to a lower U.S. effective tax rate as a result of U.S. Tax Reform, changes in pretax income mix across jurisdictions with disparate tax rates, excess tax deductions on stock-based compensation, R&D credits and a release of reserves for uncertain tax positions partially offset by an increase in current year accruals for uncertain tax positions.\nFinancial outlook\nRogers guides its 2018 second quarter net sales to a range of $210 to $220 million. Rogers guides its 2018 second quarter earnings to a range of $1.10 to $1.25 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings are guided to a range of $1.25 to $1.40 per diluted share.\nRogers guides 2018 full year capital spending to be in the range of $50 to $60 million.\nRogers guides the 2018 full year effective tax rate to be 24-26%, with a second quarter effective tax rate of 28-29%.\nAbout Rogers Corporation\nRogers Corporation (NYSE:ROG) is a global leader in engineered materials to power, protect, and connect our world.

and\n(3) Adjusted operating margin, which the Company defines as operating margin excluding acquisition-related amortization of intangible assets and Discrete Items.\nManagement believes each of these measures is useful to investors because they allow for comparison to the Company’s performance in prior periods without the effect of items that, by their nature, tend to obscure the Company’s core operating results due to the potential variability across periods based on the timing, frequency and magnitude. As a result, management believes that adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating margin enhance the ability of investors to analyze trends in the Company’s business and evaluate the Company’s performance relative to peer companies. However, non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation from, or solely as alternatives to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly named measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and their most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP are set forth below.\nReconciliation of GAAP earnings per diluted share to adjusted earnings per diluted share for the first quarter:\n2018 2017 Earnings per diluted share Q1 Q1 GAAP earnings per diluted share $1.40 $1.47 Restructuring, severance, impairment and other related costs 0.06 0.03 Acquisition and related integration costs 0.02 0.04 Gain from antitrust litigation settlement (0.15) — Gain on sale of long-lived asset — (0.03) Purchase accounting inventory adjustment — 0.05 Total discrete items ($0.07) $0.09 Earnings per diluted share adjusted for discrete items $1.33 $1.56 Acquisition intangible amortization 0.15 0.12 Adjusted earnings per diluted share $1.48 $1.68 Reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter*:\n2018 2017 (amounts in millions) Q1 Q1 Net income $26.1 $27.0 Interest expense, net 1.2 1.3 Income tax expense 4.8 12.9 Depreciation 7.3 7.2 Amortization 3.8 3.3 Restructuring, severance, impairment and other related costs 1.4 0.7 Acquisition and related integration costs 0.4 1.2 Gain from antitrust litigation settlement (3.6 ) — Loss (gain) on sale of long-lived assets — (0.9 ) Purchase accounting inventory adjustment — 1.6 Adjusted EBITDA $41.4 $54.3 *Values in table may not add due to rounding.\nReconciliation of GAAP operating margin to adjusted operating margin for the first quarter*:\n2018 2017 Operating margin Q1 Q1 GAAP operating margin 14.5% 19.2% Restructuring, severance, impairment and other related costs 0.7% 0.3% Acquisition and related integration costs 0.2% 0.6% Gain from antitrust litigation settlement (1.7)% —% Loss (gain) on sale of long-lived assets —% (0.4)% Purchase accounting inventory adjustment —% 0.8% Total discrete Items (0.8)% 1.2% Operating margin adjusted for discrete items 13.6% 20.4% Acquisition intangible amortization 1.8% 1.6% Adjusted operating margin 15.4% 22.0% *Percentages in table may not add due to rounding.\nReconciliation of GAAP earnings per diluted share to adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance for the 2018 first quarter:\nGuidance\nQ1 2018 GAAP earnings per diluted share $1.15 - $1.30 Discrete items $0.01 Acquisition intangible amortization $0.14 Adjusted earnings per diluted share $1.30 - $1.45 Reconciliation of GAAP earnings per diluted share to adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance for the 2018 second quarter:\nGuidance\nQ2 2018 GAAP earnings per diluted share $1.10 - $1.25 Discrete items $0.01 Acquisition intangible amortization $0.14 Adjusted earnings per diluted share $1.25 - $1.40\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180426006621/en/\nInvestor contact:\nRogers Corporation\nJack Monti, 480-917-6026\njack.monti@rogerscorp.com\nhttp://www.rogerscorp.com\nSource: Rogers Corporation",
