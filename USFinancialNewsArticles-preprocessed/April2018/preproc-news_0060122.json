    "text": "Highlights of the quarter\n23% revenue growth. 21% gross margin growth. 35% increase in operating income. Continued momentum with strong intermodal pricing. Hub Group Dedicated wins over $70 million of new business.\nOAK BROOK, Ill., April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hub Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:HUBG) announced first quarter 2018 net income of $16.2 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.48 versus first quarter 2017 net income of $10.3 million, or $0.31 per diluted share.\nRevenue for the current quarter was $1.1 billion compared with $892.8 million for the first quarter 2017. Hub segment revenue increased 23% and Mode segment revenue increased 19%. Operating income for the current quarter increased to $23.1 million versus $17.2 million for the first quarter 2017. Hub segment operating income increased 39% and Mode segment operating income increased 26%.\nSegment Information:\nHub\n• First quarter 2018 Segment Revenue: $831.6 million, up 23%\n• First quarter 2018 Segment Operating Income: $16.1 million, up 39%\nHub’s revenue increased 23% to $831.6 million compared to the first quarter of 2017 as a result of our success in providing multi-modal solutions to our customers. This increase includes Hub Group Dedicated revenue totaling $60.4 million.\nFirst quarter intermodal revenue increased 14% to $482.5 million reflecting a 6% increase in loads, price increases and higher fuel revenue. Intermodal gross margin increased compared to the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to an increase in customer prices and volume, partially offset by higher rail, driver, and third party drayage costs.\nTruck brokerage revenue increased 13% to $120.0 million this quarter compared to the same quarter of last year. Truck brokerage handled 1% fewer loads while fuel, price and mix combined were up 14%. Truck brokerage gross margin increased primarily because of growth with strategic customers and increased spot activity.\nFirst quarter Unyson Logistics revenue increased 16% to $168.7 million due primarily to growth from new customers on-boarded in 2017 and growth with existing customers. Unyson Logistics gross margin declined primarily due to unfavorable customer mix and higher purchased transportation costs.\nHub Group Dedicated revenue of $60.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 is up 6% sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2017 revenue of $57.1 million. We project dedicated revenue in the last half of the year will increase between 30%-40% over last year.\nCosts and expenses increased $14.0 million to $74.2 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $60.2 million in the first quarter of 2017 due primarily to the addition of $10.7 million of costs and expenses for Hub Group Dedicated and higher bonus and commission expense partially offset by lower due diligence and severance costs.\nOperating income was $16.1 million compared to $11.6 million in the first quarter 2017.\nMode\n• First quarter 2018 Segment Revenue: $ 287.9 million, up 19%\n• First quarter 2018 Segment Operating Income: $ 7.0 million, up 26%\nMode’s revenue increased 19% to $287.9 million compared to the first quarter 2017. Revenue consisted of $129.8 million in intermodal which was up 6%, $100.7 million in truck brokerage which was up 29% and $57.4 million in logistics which was up 38%.\nGross margin increased $2.6 million compared to the first quarter of 2017 due primarily to increases in logistics and truck brokerage margin.\nOperating income was $7.0 million compared to $5.6 million in the first quarter 2017.\nCash Flow and Capitalization:\nOur capital expenditures for the first quarter totaled $22.2 million, primarily for tractors, trailers, technology investments, and containers. At March 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $17.9 million.\nAt March 31, 2018, we had total debt outstanding of $284.3 million on various debt instruments compared to $302.5 million at December 31, 2017.\n2018 and Long Term Outlook\nWe expect that our 2018 diluted earnings per share will range from $2.34 to $2.44. We estimate that our 2018 capital expenditures will range from $190 million to $210 million. We project our effective tax rate will be approximately 25%.\n“Strong revenue and margin growth in the first quarter driven by a healthy intermodal pricing environment, spot opportunities, and new dedicated business position us well for a successful year,” said Dave Yeager, Hub’s Chief Executive Officer.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nHub will hold a conference call at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, April 26, 2018, to discuss its first quarter 2018 results.\nHosting the conference call will be Dave Yeager, Chief Executive Officer.
