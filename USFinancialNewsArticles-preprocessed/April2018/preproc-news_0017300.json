    "text": "April 11, 2018 / 7:14 AM / Updated an hour ago Yemen's Houthis say launched drone attack on Saudi Aramco facility Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nDUBAI (Reuters) - Yemen’s armed Houthi movement said on Wednesday it had launched a drone strike on a facility belonging to oil giant Saudi Aramco in southern Saudi Arabia - though the company said its plants there were operating “normally and safely”. \nThe Houthis’ Al-Masirah TV channel did not say when the attack took place or give details of any damage. \n“The air force announced the execution of air strikes with the Qasef-1 aircraft on Aramco in Jizan (province),” the channel said on its Twitter account, referring to a drone the Houthis unveiled last year. \nSaudi Aramco operates a 400,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Jizan, part of a new economic city on the Red Sea. \nAl-Masirah said the Houthis had also launched an attack with the same model of drone on the airport of Abha in neighbouring Asir province. \nSaudi Arabia and a coalition of mostly Gulf Arab states intervened in Yemen’s civil war in 2015 to try and push back the Houthis after the movement drove the internationally recognised government into Saudi exile. Related Coverage Saudi Aramco says Jizan facilities safe after Houthis claim attack \nThe coalition has launched thousands of air strikes which have hit schools, markets and hospitals, killing hundreds of people - though it says it does not target civilians. \nThe Houthis have stepped up ballistic missile attacks on the kingdom in what it says is retaliation for the air raids. \nThey have frequently claimed attacks, including on Aramco facilities, that Saudi Arabia and its main ally the United Arab Emirates have either said did not happen or were intercepted. \nThe group unveiled what it said was a series of drones, including the Qasef-1, at a ceremony last year. \nThe arms monitor Conflict Armament Research (CAR) said it had evidence showing the Qasef-1 and other Houthi kit was made in Iran and was not of indigenous design and construction “in contrast to Houthi statements”. \nThe coalition accuses the Houthis of being armed and supported by Iran - charges the group and Tehran deny.
