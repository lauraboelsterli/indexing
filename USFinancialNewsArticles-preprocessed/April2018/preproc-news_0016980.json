Investment will remain at the higher level in its next financial year.\nInvestors were unimpressed by the higher costs, sending its shares down 4.7 percent to 6,698 pence at 0945 GMT.\nThe company, which is still listed on London’s junior AIM market, has an eyewatering price-earnings ratio of 92. Its market capitalisation of 5.9 billion pounds is more than 1.5 billion pounds higher than that of retail stalwart Marks and Spencer.\nASOS Chief Executive Nick Beighton said the company was trading strongly, with visits to its site exceeding 1 billion in the six months.\n“Alongside our investment in our people and our technology, we are accelerating investment in our distribution and logistics, laying the foundation for 4 billion pounds of net sales,” he said.\nATLANTA WAREHOUSE Beighton said the extra money was needed to keep upgrading its 200 localised websites, and incorporate more artificial intelligence into services like its recommendations engine and visual search.\nIt will also open its warehouse in Atlanta, United States, in July, three or four months earlier than planned, he said.\nASOS, like its online fashion rivals Zalando and Boohoo.com, has focused on rapid sales growth through investment, prizing market share above all.\nGermany’s Zalando guided to higher capex last month, also hitting its shares.\nASOS’ shares had risen 29 percent in the last 12 months but Wednesday’s drop wiped out all the gains made in 2018.\nAnalysts at RBC Capital markets, who have an outperform rating on ASOS, remained bullish, saying it could deliver compound annual earnings per share growth of 28 percent over the next three years if its margins remain stable.\n“Management will continue to prioritise market share gain and reinvest operating leverage into enhancing the proposition, which we believe is the winning strategy in the internet space,” they said.\nASOS reported pretax profit of 29.9 million pounds, just shy of average market forecasts of 30.8 million pounds.\nIt kept its forecast for around 25-30 percent reported sales growth for the year unchanged, along with its target of an operating profit margin of about 4 percent.
