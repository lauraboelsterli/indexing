    "text": "(Reuters) - Islamic State’s Amaq News Agency released a video on Friday showing what they said was Islamic State militants shooting “two advocators” for next month’s Iraqi parliamentary elections in the town of al-Tarmiyah, in the Salah al-Din governorate north of Baghdad.\nIslamic State said earlier this week that it would attack polling stations in Iraq during parliamentary elections next month and that anyone who participated in the vote would be considered an infidel.\nIn an audio message released on April 22, the militant group’s spokesman accused Iraq’s Shi’ite-led government of being a proxy of Iran and warned that anyone who runs or votes in the May 12 election would be targeted.\nIraqi officials have said polling stations will be well protected.\nIraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared victory in December over Islamic State, which seized a third of Iraq in 2014, but the hardline Sunni militants have reverted to insurgency tactics following the crumbling of their self-declared caliphate.\nReporting by Mohamed El-Sherif in Cairo; Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ",
