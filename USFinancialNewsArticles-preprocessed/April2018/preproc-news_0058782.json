    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus ( AIR.PA ) said there was no read- across to engines made by Rolls-Royce ( RR.L ) to power its A330neo planes from the durability problems with Rolls engines installed on Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner jets.\n“I’m not aware that there’s commonality of a problem between 787 and the A330neo engine, so it’s separate,” Airbus CFO Harald Wilhelm told analysts on a first-quarter results call when asked whether the issue could infect the Rolls engines it has ordered.\nRolls-Royce is working to fix problems with its Trent 1000 engines on 787s, where turbine blades have worn out sooner than expected, forcing airlines to disrupt their schedules to allow for the engines to be inspected more regularly.\nAirbus will use Rolls’s Trent 7000 to power the A330neo jet which is due to enter service later this year. The Trent 7000 is derived from the Trent 1000-TEN product which is used on some Dreamliners.\nWilhelm said Airbus was talking to Rolls to make sure it was focused on the A330neo project.\n“We send reminders...to the wide body engine guys (Rolls-Royce and rival engine-maker GE ( GE.N )) to be on spot and that means in the case obviously of the A330 to be on spot for an entry to service in 2018,” he said.\nReporting by Tim Hepher; Writing by Sarah Young; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ",
