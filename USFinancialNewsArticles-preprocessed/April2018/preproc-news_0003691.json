    "text": "CNBC.com Michael Brochstein | SOPA Images | LightRocket | Getty Images Laura Ingraham, at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) sponsored by the American Conservative Union held at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center in Oxon Hill, Maryland. \nRight-wing commentator Laura Ingraham has taken a week off as host of her Fox News television show after more than a dozen companies said they will pull advertisements from her program. \nAmong the latest corporations to cut ties with Ingraham were Liberty Mutual, which confirmed to CNBC that it doesn't plans to run anymore ads on her show, and Bayer, which made its announcement on social media. Bayer Yes, @ JonCoopertweets , that's right. @ BayerUS has stopped advertising on Laura Ingraham and we have no plans to resume any time in the future. \nThe advertising exodus began Thursday, shortly after Ingraham sent a tweet mocking a survivor of February's mass shooting at a Parkland, Florida, high school that left 17 students and adults dead. \nThe student she mocked, 17-year-old David Hogg, has become a prominent figure in the debate over gun policy that has recaptured the national spotlight after the massacre. \n\"David Hogg Rejected By Four Colleges To Which He Applied and whines about it,\" Ingraham said in the tweet.",
