    "text": "ZURICH (Reuters) - Chemchina’s CNNCC.UL Syngenta is looking to raise up to $4.8 billion through the issuance of senior bonds and a potential banking loan to help finance the Chinese company’s $43.5 billion acquisition of the Basel-based unit completed last May.\nThe logo of Swiss agrochemicals maker Syngenta is seen on a farm in the village of Geispitzen, France June 27, 2017. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann The agricultural unit on Thursday said it had mandated banks BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ), Citi ( C.N ), Credit Suisse ( CSGN.S ) and HSBC ( HSBA.L ) to arrange a series of fixed income investor meetings beginning April 9.\nChief Financial Officer Mark Patrick in February said the unit aimed to sell around $5 billion in bonds after clinching a settlement with U.S. farmers who had sued over genetically engineered corn.\nReporting by Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi\n ",
