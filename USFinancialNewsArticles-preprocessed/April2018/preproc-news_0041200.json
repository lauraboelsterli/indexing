    "text": "* German 10-year yield set for biggest weekly rise since Feb\n* Long-term inflation expectations highest since mid-March\n* BoE’s Carney dampens May rate hike expectations in UK\n* Euro zone periphery govt bond yields tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr (Adds Trump tweet, background, updates prices)\nBy Abhinav Ramnarayan\nLONDON, April 20 (Reuters) - German government bond yields were set for their biggest weekly rise since the beginning of February after a surge in oil prices forced inflation expectations and euro zone bond yields higher.\nEuro zone bond yields hit fresh highs on Friday and are now well above their levels at the start of the week after a sharp sell off prompted by Brent crude prices hitting a three-year-plus high of $74.75 a barrel on Thursday.\nThis prompted a tweet from U.S. President Donald Trump in which he said oil prices were “articifially very high” and “will not be accepted”.\nHigher oil prices tend to push up inflation, which in turn strengthens the case for tighter monetary policy and higher rates.\nThe yield on Germany’s 10-year government bond, the benchmark for the region, hit a near five-week high of 0.606 percent and is 9 bps higher this week so far, after having fallen in seven of the last 10 weeks.\nFrench and Dutch equivalents were also set for their biggest weekly rises in ten.\n“The market is hoping that higher oil prices will lead to higher inflation in a sustainable manner,” said DZ Bank strategist Sebastian Fellechner.\n“But this is hard to say because oil prices are only one factor, we need confirmation, we need to see other factors kick in such as wage growth,” he added.\nStill, a market gauge of long-term euro zone inflation expectations, the five-year five-year forward inflation-linked swap, was close to the highest level since mid-March hit on Thursday at 1.6898 percent.\nThe sell off in bonds this week comes after a long stretch in which euro zone yields were kept compressed by factors including the possibility of a trade war between the United States and other major world economies, China in particular.\nAs G20 policy meetings get underway, this will likely be a major topic for discussion ahead of next week’s European Central Bank meeting, Commerzbank analysts said in a note.\nAlready Japan has warned its G20 counterparts that protectionism and exchange of retaliatory measures will disrupt financial markets and heighten volatility.\nLarge redemptions this month have also played a role in keeping yields lower and this is set to continue next week with French coupon and redemptions alone worth 37.3 billion euros, according to the Commerzbank analysts.\nAlso on Friday British borrowing costs dropped after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney dampened May rate hike expectations in the UK.\nThe yield on 10-year Gilts were lower 3 bps while 2-year Gilts were 4 bps lower on the day.\nLater on Friday, Moody’s is set to review Portugal’s rating, and market participants are looking to see if the Iberian country regains its third major investment grade rating.
