    "text": "MATTOON, Ill., April 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First Mid-Illinois Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FMBH) (the “Company”) today announced its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nRecord quarterly net income of $8.4 million, or $0.66 diluted earnings per share Strong loan growth of $38.2 million, or 2.0% Announced plan to close First BancTrust Corporation acquisition May 1 st , sooner than initially planned, helping drive cost savings in excess of original estimate\n“We kicked off 2018 on a strong note with our highest quarterly net income ever,” said Joe Dively, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “The first quarter results were led by strong loan growth, in what has historically been a seasonally soft quarter, and our continued asset quality improvement leading to minimal net charge-offs.”\n“The First BancTrust Corporation (“First Bank”) acquisition is expected to close on May 1 st and I could not be more pleased with the progress that has been made to date. The cultural and organizational alignment is going well and we now expect to achieve cost savings in excess of our original estimates. We are excited to join forces with First Bank and build upon the strong reputation and expand the products and services in the communities it serves,” Dively concluded.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income for the first quarter of 2018 declined by $0.3 million, or 1.2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by a $0.9 million reduction in total accretion income from the fourth quarter. The first quarter of 2018 included a total of $0.6 million in accretion income. Excluding the accretion reduction, net interest income increased by $0.6 million with growth in loan and investment income more than offsetting increases in deposit costs.\nIn comparison to the first quarter of 2017, net interest income increased by $0.4 million, or 1.9%. The increase was primarily attributable to higher interest rates, which were partially offset by higher deposit costs.\nNet Interest Margin\nNet interest margin, on a tax equivalent basis, was 3.65% for the first quarter compared to 3.72% in the prior quarter and 3.63% in the first quarter last year. The decline from the fourth quarter was driven by the lower tax rate impacting municipal securities and loans, which had a 7 basis point impact on the rate. Excluding this change, the net interest margin would have been flat from the fourth quarter and an increase of 9 basis point from the prior year. The year-over-year increase in the ratio was primarily due to higher yields on loans and investments, which outpaced the increase in cost of funds.\nLoan Portfolio\nTotal loans increased by $38.2 million, or 2.0%, in the quarter and ended at $1.98 billion compared to $1.94 billion at the end of the prior quarter. The first quarter is typically a seasonally soft quarter due to the paydown in agriculture operating loans. While these paydowns still occurred, growth in commercial real estate and commercial and industrial outpaced the declines. Loans declined by $30.3 million in the first quarter of last year.\nAsset Quality\nAt March 31, 2018, nonperforming loans were 0.90% of total loans, which was consistent with the prior quarter. Allowance for loan losses in the first quarter was 1.05% of total loans compared to 1.03% in the prior quarter, and the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans was 116.2% versus 114.1% in the prior quarter. Non-performing loans were $17.9 million, which was an increase of $0.4 million versus the prior quarter and a decrease of $9.8 million from the first quarter of last year.\nNet charge-offs were $0.3 million during the first quarter compared to $1.0 million in the prior quarter. The Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $1.1 million during the first quarter compared to $2.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $1.7 million in the first quarter of last year.\nDeposits\nTotal deposits ended the quarter at $2.29 billion, which represented an increase of $17.3 million from the prior quarter and a decrease of $37.6 million from the same quarter last year. The Company’s average rate on cost of funds was 0.32% for the quarter compared to 0.29% in the fourth quarter and 0.22% in the first quarter of 2017. The Company continues to maintain a strong core deposit base.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income for the first quarter of 2018 was $7.5 million compared to $7.2 million in the fourth quarter and $7.5 million in the first quarter of last year. Noninterest income is traditionally higher in the first quarter due to the timing of insurance commission revenues. Year-over-year non-interest income increased in trust, brokerage and debit card revenue and was offset by declines in insurance and service charges.\nNoninterest Expenses\nNoninterest expense for the first quarter totaled $18.4 million, or $0.8 million lower than the previous quarter. The current quarter included $0.3 million in acquisition related costs. In the fourth quarter, the Company recorded a $0.5 million loss on the sale of a former First Clover Leaf credit and approximately $0.4 million of additional stock compensation expense.\nNoninterest expense also decreased by $0.8 million when compared to the first quarter of 2017. During the first quarter of last year, the Company completed the bank merger and system conversion with First Clover Leaf recognizing $1.7 million of acquisition related costs. The Company’s efficiency ratio, on a tax equivalent basis, for the first quarter 2018 was 57.2% compared to 60.1% for the same period last year.\nRegulatory Capital Levels and Dividend\nThe Company’s capital levels comfortably remained above the “well capitalized” levels and ended the period as follows:\nTotal capital to risk-weighted assets 13.07% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 12.17% Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 11.12% Leverage ratio 10.06% On April 25, 2018, the Board of Directors declared the Company’s next semi-annual dividend, on a pro-rated basis, of $0.05 for shareholders of record on June 1 st and payable on June 8 th . On April 13 th , the Company issued a press release announcing a pro-rated semi-annual dividend of $0.29 payable on April 30 th in order to align the timing of dividend payments with the closing of its acquisition of First Bank. The combined April 30 th and June 8 th dividends total $0.34, which represents an increase of 6.3% over the dividend paid in the first half of 2017.\nCapital Raise\nUnder the previously announced ‘at-the-market’ equity offering, during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company did not sell any shares.\nAbout First Mid-Illinois Bancshares, Inc.: First Mid-Illinois Bancshares, Inc. is the parent company of First Mid-Illinois Bank & Trust, N.A.
