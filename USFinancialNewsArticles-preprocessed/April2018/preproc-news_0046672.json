    "text": "WASHINGTON, U.S. President Donald Trump’s physician Ronny Jackson will not withdraw as the nominee to head the Veterans Affairs department and will fight allegations about his conduct that surfaced ahead of a Senate confirmation hearing, a White House official said on Tuesday.\nJackson met with Trump on Tuesday after the president said he was leaving the decision up to the physician. The White House is now preparing a defense, feeling that Jackson - well liked by administration figures from both parties - was being railroaded.\n“We’re pushing back,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
