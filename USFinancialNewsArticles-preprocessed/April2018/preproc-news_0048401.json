(the Company) (NASDAQ: FBSS), parent company of The Fauquier Bank, reported net income of $1.3 million, or $0.34 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared with a net loss of $544,000, or $(0.14) per diluted share for the prior quarter and $768,000 or $0.20 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2017.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company's return on average equity (ROE) and return on average assets (ROA) were 9.16% and 0.77%, respectively, compared with a loss on average equity of (3.77)% and a loss on average assets of (0.33)% for the prior quarter and return of 5.68% and 0.50%, respectively, for the first quarter of 2017. The loss on average equity and average assets for the prior quarter was the direct result of an adjustment related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nMarc Bogan, President and CEO said, \"We made significant progress during the first quarter as we continue to strive towards achieving our strategic initiatives of growing the balance sheet, increasing profitability through net interest income and other fee income, and increasing our efficiencies by managing expenses. With this progress, we are gaining traction on becoming a high performing community bank.\"\nTotal assets were $682.0 million on March 31, 2018 compared with $644.6 million and $630.0 million on December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively.

Net interest income was $5.7 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared with $5.6 million for the prior quarter and $4.9 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nNonperforming assets were $10.9 million on March 31, 2018, compared with $10.4 million on December 31, 2017 and $11.5 million on March 31, 2017.

With this in mind, our key strategic objectives and our current outlook are:\nWe continue to maintain a strong net interest margin and have done so since the fourth quarter of 2016. Our focus is on loan and deposit pricing to ensure a well maintained and healthy margin. Commercial and consumer loan growth continues to show improvement with several new loan products, all while maintaining strong asset quality. While these new offerings bring added benefits to the Company and our clients, we continue to have credit standards that do not compromise our credit quality. The origination and sales of secondary market loans continues to provide an additional source of noninterest income, along with our Wealth Management services and fee income tied to our retail products. Noninterest expenses have stabilized, however we recognize room for improvement. Our management team continues to evaluate process efficiencies to continue to reduce operating costs.\nFauquier Bankshares, through its operating subsidiary, The Fauquier Bank, is an independent, locally-owned, community bank offering a full range of financial services, including internet banking, mobile banking with mobile deposit, commercial, retail, insurance, wealth management, and financial planning services through eleven banking offices throughout Fauquier and Prince William counties in Virginia.
