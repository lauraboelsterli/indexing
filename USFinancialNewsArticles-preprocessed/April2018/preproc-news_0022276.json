    "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday she regretted that the U.N. Security Council was unable to agree joint language on the escalating conflict in Syria.\nSpeaking to reporters after a two-day cabinet meeting, Merkel added that she did not want to speculate on what may happen next in the region.\nRussia has warned that any U.S. missiles fired at Syria over a suspected chemical weapons attack on a rebel enclave would be shot down and the launch sites targeted, raising the possibility of a U.S.-Russian confrontation.
