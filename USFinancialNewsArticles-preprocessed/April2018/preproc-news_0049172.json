It reported a 2 percent fall in sales and earnings held back by a stronger pound and more pricing pressure in respiratory medicine.\nWhitbread shares got an initial boost after announcing the spin-off of Costa Coffee - a move long sought by activist investors - but then retreated, closing 0.2 percent down on the day.\nThe tobacco sector was one of the only other areas trading in positive territory with Imperial Brands up 3.5 percent and British American Tobacco rising 2.8 percent.\nUBS analysts said that the latter’s guidance for products such as tobacco heating products would likely reassure the market.\nThe company said it plans to spend more this year on products such as e-cigarettes with a large number of launches set for the end of the third quarter.\nBritain’s Lloyds Banking Group lost 1.7 percent after slightly missing expectations for pre-tax profits but Jefferies analysts said the earnings figures were unlikely to change the overall picture.\n“We do not see consensus estimates moving either way post today’s release”, they wrote.\nLloyd also said it would not cancel its preference shares following investor complaints about the possibility after insurer Aviva abandoned its plans to scrap the high-yielding shares.
