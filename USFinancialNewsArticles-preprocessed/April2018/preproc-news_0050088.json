    "text": "Center fielder Ender Inciarte’s drag bunt scored Johan Camargo in the ninth inning and gave the Atlanta Braves a 4-3 come-from-behind win over the New York Mets on Saturday at SunTrust Park.\nThe Braves won it against New York closer Jeurys Familia (1-1), who allowed his first runs of the season and failed in his effort to get a four-out save.\nAtlanta’s Dansby Swanson walked to open the ninth and scored on Camargo’s triple to right field. Kurt Suzuki hit a liner to third base that Todd Frazier was able to knock down and prevent a run.\nAfter pinch hitter Charlie Culberson struck out, Inciarte dropped a bunt down the first base line, and Camargo raced home with the game-winning run.\nThe winning pitcher was Jesse Biddle (1-0), who pitched a scoreless inning in his major league debut.\nThe Mets scored three times in the top of the eighth to break open a scoreless game.\nAtlanta reliever Sam Freeman walked Wilmer Flores to open the eighth inning, and Jose Reyes was safe on a bunt single. Michael Conforto reached on a fielder’s choice when Atlanta second baseman Ozzie Albies made an error while trying to turn a double play. The play was originally ruled an out but was overturned after a video review and loaded the bases for Yoenis Cespedes.\nShane Carle took over on the mound and got Cespedes to fly out, but Asdrubal Cabrera followed with a two-run single to right field to give the Mets a 2-0 lead. Jay Bruce drove the third run home with a single to center.\nThe Braves got two runs back in the bottom of the eighth on a Freddie Freeman double that almost left the park. Familia then entered with two outs and struck out Preston Tucker to end the threat.\nFor the first seven innings, the game was a pitching duel between New York’s Jacob deGrom and Atlanta’s Julio Teheran.\nDeGrom allowed no runs on four hits and two walks. He struck out 10, giving him back-to-back double-digit strikeout games.\nTeheran allowed no runs on four hits and one walk. He struck out six. It was the third time in five starts that he has not received a decision.\nIt was Teheran’s second straight strong effort at SunTrust Park, where he had gone 4-10 with a 5.93 ERA in 20 previous starts. In his last two home starts, Teheran has allowed one run in 13 innings with 15 strikeouts.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
