    "text": "April 7, 2018 / 3:59 PM / Updated 18 minutes ago Norway's wealth should be allowed to invest in unlisted renewables -ruling Conservative party Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nOSLO, April 7 (Reuters) - Norway’s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund should be allowed to invest in unlisted renewable projects such as solar parks and wind farms, the ruling Conservative party voted on Saturday. \nThe world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, which invests Norway’s oil and gas revenues in stocks, bonds and real estate, has for many years sought permission to invest in unlisted infrastructure assets. \n“Let the fund invest in unlisted infrastructure for renewable energy with the same demand for profitability as for other investments,” said the motion. \nThe decision strengthens the possibility that the fund could invest in the new asset class as the Conservatives are the leading party in Norway’s minority coalition government. \nThe other parties are the rightwing Progress Party and the centrist, pro-green Liberals.
