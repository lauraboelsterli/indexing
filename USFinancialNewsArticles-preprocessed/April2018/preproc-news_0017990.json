Soccer Football - Premier League - Arsenal vs Southampton - Emirates Stadium, London, Britain - April 8, 2018 Southampton's Ryan Bertrand in action with Arsenal's Reiss Nelson REUTERS/David Klein \nThe 18-year-old, who featured in all of Arsenal’s Europa League group stage matches this season, started Sunday’s 3-2 league win over Southampton. \n“It is a big achievement to sign for a big club like Arsenal so I’m just delighted with the contract and hopeful that I can sign it soon,” Nelson told British media.

I have done that, I have had 15 appearances.
