    "text": "NEW YORK, April 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MorphoSys AG (Nasdaq:MOR), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company devoted to the development of innovative and differentiated therapies for patients suffering from serious diseases, visited the Nasdaq MarketSite in Times Square today in celebration of its initial public offering (IPO) on The Nasdaq Stock Market.\nMorphoSys AG (Nasdaq: MOR), a late-stage, biopharmaceutical company devoted to the development of innovative and differentiated therapies for patients suffering from serious diseases, visits the Nasdaq MarketSite in Times Square.\nTogether with its partners, MorphoSys has aided in the development of more than 100 therapeutic product candidates based on its proprietary technology platforms and leadership in the field of therapeutic antibody discovery, generation and engineering. With more than 28 product candidates in clinical development, MorphoSys boasts a large and diverse pipeline, composed of both proprietary and partnered programs, in multiple therapeutic areas and across all development phases of drug candidates.\n“MorphoSys has a proven track record of applying its proprietary technology to developing innovative therapeutic candidates,” said Dr. Simon E. Moroney, D. Phil, Co-founder & Chief Executive Officer of MorphoSys. “The recent successful launch of Tremfya® by our partner Janssen was an important milestone for MorphoSys, as it was the first market introduction of a therapeutic agent made using our proprietary technology. Our focus is now on MOR208, a product candidate for aggressive lymphoma, which received FDA breakthrough designation in 2017. Our Nasdaq listing is an important part of our plan to advance the development of MOR208 in preparation for its potential commercialization in the United States. We are now well-positioned to expand our footprint in the U.S. and to continue to build a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company.”\n“MorphoSys’s rich heritage in antibody discovery and development, paired with its proprietary technologies, truly sets it apart as a leader in the biopharmaceutical industry,” said Nelson Griggs, President, Nasdaq Stock Exchange. “We are excited to welcome MorphoSys to the Nasdaq Stock Exchange and support the company’s continued success as it works to improve the lives of patients suffering from serious diseases.”\nThe information contained above is provided for informational and educational purposes only, and nothing contained herein should be construed as investment advice, either on behalf of a particular security or an overall investment strategy.
