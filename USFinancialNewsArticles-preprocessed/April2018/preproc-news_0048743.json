FILE PHOTO: A 77-inch LG Signature W OLED television is displayed during the 2017 CES in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S., January 5, 2017. REUTERS/Steve Marcus/File Photo \nThe Apple Inc supplier posted an operating loss of 98 billion won ($91.1 million) for January-March. That compares with a 1 trillion won profit in the same period a year ago and an average forecast of a 58.1 billion won loss drawn from 14 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nRevenue fell 19.6 percent to 5.7 trillion won. \n($1 = 1,076.1500 won)",
