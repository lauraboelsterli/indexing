    "text": "YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- United Community Financial Corp. (Company) (NASDAQ: UCFC), parent company of Home Savings Bank (Home Savings), announced today net income of $8.6 million and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) of $0.171 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. The first quarter of 2017 results included two months of operations from Premier Bank & Trust that was acquired on January 31, 2017. In comparison, the first quarter of 2018 results include a full quarter of operations.\nFirst quarter 2018 highlights:\nLoan growth of 2.7% for the quarter Customer deposit growth of 5.8% for the quarter Net interest margin improved four basis points to 3.47% for the quarter ROA of 1.28%, ROE of 11.44% for the quarter Dividend of $0.06 per common share declared\nGary M. Small President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company commented, “I am very pleased with the first quarter results. We achieved excellent loan and deposit growth while margin metrics remained very strong. The investments made in our team and the expansion of our product offerings in 2017, are clearly making a difference in our results today.”\nStrong Loan and Deposit Growth\nTotal loan growth for the first quarter was $57.1 million, or 11.0% on an annualized basis. At March 31, 2018, total net loans aggregated $2.14 billion.\nCommercial loan growth was $50.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, or 24.6% on an annualized basis. Consumer loans increased $5.6 million, or 8.2% annualized, during the same time period. The increase in consumer loans was primarily due to the growth and expansion of indirect auto lending, which grew 16.7% during the first quarter of 2018.\nTotal customer deposit growth for the first quarter was $104.9 million, or 5.8% for the quarter. Included in that growth was an increase of $21.9 million of non-interest bearing deposits, which grew at an annualized rate of 24.7%. The Company experienced deposit gains from all lines of business including commercial, private banking, consumer and public funds. Total customer deposits totaled $1.9 billion at March 31, 2018.\nNet Interest Margin Expands\nNet interest income totaled $21.5 million and $21.6 million on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, up 2.5% from the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The positive change is a result of a higher level of earning assets compared to the prior period as well as fees associated with the early payoff of loans.\nThe net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis was 3.47% for the first quarter, which was four basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2017. This was partially offset by a lower FTE adjustment of approximately two basis points, due to the tax law change.\nExcluding purchase accounting yield adjustments, the net interest margin would have been 8 basis points lower, or 3.39%, for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nNonperforming Loans to Total Loans Ratio Decreases during the First Quarter\nAsset quality remained stable during the first quarter. The ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was 0.59% at March 31, 2018, which is comparable to what was reported in the previous quarter and the quarter a year ago.\nThe provision for loan losses totaled $407,000 for the first quarter of 2018, which was down $808,000 in comparison to the prior quarter. Net charge-offs for the quarter, both gross and net, remained negligible. As of March 31, 2018, the Company’s allowance for loan losses to total loans was 1.04%, versus 1.05% at December 31, 2017 and 1.02% at March 31, 2017.\nLoans acquired through the acquisition during the first quarter of 2017 were recorded at fair value. When combining the remaining fair value adjustment of $3.3 million and the Company’s allowance, the Company’s allowance as a percentage of total loans increases to 1.20%.\nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income increased to $5.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $5.4 million reported in the first quarter of 2017. The Company realized strong gains in insurance agency income, mortgage servicing fees and trust fees along with additional gains on the sale of available for sale securities. Mortgage banking income was up slightly from the same period a year ago even as mortgage rates have climbed. The Company continues to make strides in increasing its share of the business in this segment even in a more difficult operating environment.\nNon-Interest Expense\nNon-interest expense was $16.6 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $15.3 million in the first quarter of 2017 when merger expense is excluded. The resulting increase is due to higher operating expenses after the acquisition, which occurred on January 31, 2017, with only two months of expense included in the 2017 results. In addition, the Company took advantage of timing opportunities in the market during the latter half of 2017 to add talented employees to expand several lines of business including treasury management, wealth management and commercial lending. The additional staff increased salary expense in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017, but also contributed to the deposit and revenue growth success.\nEffective Tax Rate\nThe Company’s effective tax rate on an FTE basis at March 31, 2018 was 18.06% compared to 34.05% at March 31, 2017. The decline was due to the enactment of recent tax legislation.\nDividend to be Paid\nOn April 17, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per common share payable May 11, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business April 27, 2018.\nConference Call\nUnited Community Financial Corp. will host an earnings conference call on Wednesday, April 18, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. ET., to provide an overview of the Company's first quarter 2018 results and highlights.
