FILE PHOTO: England's Dylan Hartley, sings the national anthem before the Rugby Union Six Nations Championship match between England and Ireland at Twickenham Stadium, London, Britain, March 17, 2018. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo \nHooker Hartley was injured in England’s Six Nations match against Ireland last month and has not played since. \n“I’m very disappointed that I will not be available for selection for Saints’ remaining Premiership games, as well England’s tour to South Africa,” Hartley said in a statement. \n“It has been recommended by specialists that I take a break this summer and while I find that decision hard to accept, it’s important I listen to that advice.” \nEngland’s three-test series in South Africa starts on June 9.
