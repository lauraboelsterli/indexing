Big banks such as JPMorgan Chase , Citigroup and Wells Fargo will kick off the earnings season with their results on Friday.\nAnalysts expect quarterly profits for S&P 500 companies to rise 18.5 percent from a year ago, which would be the biggest gain in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe so-called FANG stocks - Facebook Inc, Amazon.com , Netflix Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google - were up between 1.2 percent and 3 percent ahead of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's testimony before U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday and Wednesday.\nThe CEO is expected to strike a conciliatory tone in an attempt to blunt possible regulatory fallout from the privacy scandal engulfing his social network.\nOn Monday, stocks pared gains late in the session following a report that the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided the office of President Donald Trump's lawyer.\nAt 8:44 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 297 points, or 1.24 percent, with 90,792 contracts changing hands.\nS&P 500 e-minis were up 29.25 points, or 1.12 percent, with 307,025 contracts traded.\nNasdaq 100 e-minis were up 89 points, or 1.37 percent, on volume of 103,947 contracts.\nAmong stocks, shares of Nvidia rose 4 percent premarket after Morgan Stanley raised the stock to \"overweight\".\nVerifone Systems shares, which were the most traded premarket, rose 53 percent after the company agreed to be taken private for $2.28 billion.\n(Reporting by Sweta Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)",
