    "text": "HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Phillips 66 Partners LP (NYSE: PSXP) announces that the board of directors of its general partner declared a first-quarter 2018 cash distribution of $0.714 per common unit. This quarter’s distribution represents an increase of 5 percent over the previous quarterly distribution of $0.678 per unit and a 22 percent increase over first-quarter 2017. The distribution increase is consistent with previous guidance that the partnership expects a 30 percent compound annual distribution growth rate from the last quarter of 2013 through 2018. This is the eighteenth consecutive quarterly distribution increase since Phillips 66 Partners’ initial public offering in 2013. The first-quarter distribution is payable May 14, 2018, to unitholders of record as of April 30, 2018.\nAbout Phillips 66 Partners\nHeadquartered in Houston, Phillips 66 Partners is a growth-oriented master limited partnership formed by Phillips 66 to own, operate, develop and acquire primarily fee-based crude oil, refined petroleum products and natural gas liquids pipelines and terminals and other transportation and midstream assets.
