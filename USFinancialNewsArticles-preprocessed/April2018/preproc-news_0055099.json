    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Lazard Ltd (NYSE:LAZ):\nRecord quarterly\noperating revenue of\n$724 million\nRecord AUM\nof $252 billion;\nnet inflows of $2.4 billion\nIncreasing quarterly\ndividend 7%\nto $0.44 per share\nLazard Ltd (NYSE:LAZ) today reported record quarterly operating revenue 1 of $724 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Net income, as adjusted 1 and excluding one-time charges 2 , was $166 million, or $1.26 (diluted) per share for the quarter.\nFirst-quarter 2018 net income on a U.S. GAAP basis was $160 million, or $1.21 per share (diluted).\n“Our record results this quarter reflect high performance across our franchise globally,” said Kenneth M. Jacobs, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Lazard. “Our clients and our shareholders are benefitting from investments we’ve made in the business, and we continue to pursue opportunities for growth.”\n($ in millions, except per share data and AUM)\nQuarter Ended March 31, 2018\n2017\n%’18-’17\nNet Income\nU.S. GAAP $160 $108 48% Per share, diluted $1.21 $0.81 49% Adjusted 1,2 $166 $110 51% Per share, diluted\n$1.26 $0.83 52% Operating Revenue 1\nTotal operating revenue $724 $624 16% Financial Advisory $389 $336 16% Asset Management $330 $278 18% AUM ($ in billions)\nPeriod End $252 $215 17% Average $256 $206 24% Note: Endnotes are on page 6 of this release. A reconciliation of adjusted GAAP to U.S. GAAP is on page 15.\nOPERATING REVENUE\nOperating revenue was a quarterly record of $724 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, up 16% from first-quarter 2017.\nFinancial Advisory\nOur Financial Advisory results include M&A Advisory, Capital Advisory, Capital Raising, Restructuring, Shareholder Advisory, Sovereign Advisory, and other strategic advisory work for clients.\nFinancial Advisory operating revenue was a first-quarter record of $389 million for 2018, 16% higher than the first quarter of 2017. The results were driven primarily by record first-quarter operating revenue in M&A Advisory, partially offset by a decrease in Restructuring.\nAmong the major M&A transactions that were completed during the first quarter of 2018 were the following (clients are in italics): Sempra Energy’s acquisition of an 80% interest in Oncor, valuing Oncor at $18.8 billion; Calpine’s $17.1 billion sale to a consortium led by Energy Capital Partners; Sanofi’s $11.6 billion acquisition of Bioverativ; Safran’s €8.2 billion acquisition of Zodiac Aerospace; and AVEVA’s $5.2 billion combination with Schneider Electric’s industrial software business.\nAmong the major M&A transactions that were announced during or since the first quarter of 2018 were the following: Express Scripts’ $67 billion sale to Cigna; AkzoNobel’s €10.1 billion sale of its Specialty Chemicals business to Carlyle and GIC; and AccorHotels’ sale of a 55% stake in AccorInvest.\nDuring or since the first quarter of 2018 we have been engaged in a broad range of highly visible and complex restructuring and debt advisory assignments for debtors and creditors. Assignments completed during the first quarter of 2018 on which Lazard advised included: Toshiba in connection with the restructuring of its Westinghouse subsidiary; and CGG and Expro Group in connection with their Chapter 11 or similar bankruptcy restructurings.\nOur Sovereign and Capital Advisory services remained active globally, advising governments and corporations on balance sheet matters, financing strategy and capital raising.\nPlease see M&A transactions on which Lazard advised in the first quarter, or continued to advise or completed since March 31, 2018, as well as Capital Advisory, Sovereign Advisory and Restructuring assignments, on pages 7-10 of this release.\nAsset Management\nIn the text portion of this press release, we present our Asset Management results as 1) Management fees and other revenue, and 2) Incentive fees.\nAsset Management operating revenue was a first-quarter record of $330 million for 2018, 18% higher than the first quarter of 2017.\nManagement fees and other revenue was a quarterly record of $324 million, 19% higher than the first quarter of 2017, and 1% higher than the fourth quarter of 2017. The sequential increase was primarily driven by an increase in average assets under management (AUM). Average AUM for the first quarter of 2018 was a record $256 billion, 24% higher than the first quarter of 2017, and 5% higher than the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAUM as of March 31, 2018, was a record $252 billion, up 11% over the average AUM for full-year 2017; up 17% from March 31, 2017; and up 1% from December 31, 2017. The sequential increase was primarily driven by net inflows of $2.4 billion. The net inflows were primarily driven by strategies in our global and emerging markets equities and all fixed income platforms.\nIncentive fees during the period were $6 million, compared to $7 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nOPERATING EXPENSES\nCompensation and Benefits\nIn managing compensation and benefits expense, we focus on annual awarded compensation (cash compensation and benefits plus deferred incentive compensation with respect to the applicable year, net of estimated future forfeitures and excluding charges). We believe annual awarded compensation reflects the actual annual compensation cost more accurately than the GAAP measure of compensation cost, which includes applicable-year cash compensation and the amortization of deferred incentive compensation principally attributable to previous years’ deferred compensation. We believe that by managing our business using awarded compensation with a consistent deferral policy, we can better manage our compensation costs, increase our flexibility in the future and build shareholder value over time.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, we accrued adjusted compensation and benefits expense 1 at an adjusted compensation ratio of 55.8%, which is consistent with the full-year 2017 ratio, and compares to the first-quarter 2017 ratio of 56.5%. This resulted in $404 million of compensation and benefits expense, compared to $353 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nWe manage our compensation and benefits expense based on awarded compensation with a consistent deferral policy. We take a disciplined approach to compensation, and our goal is to maintain a compensation-to-operating revenue ratio over the cycle in the mid- to high-50s percentage range on both an awarded and adjusted basis, with consistent deferral policies.\nNon-Compensation Expense\nFor the first quarter of 2018, adjusted non-compensation expense 1 was $114 million, 6% higher than the first quarter of 2017, primarily reflecting higher activity levels and investment in our business.\nThe ratio of adjusted non-compensation expense to operating revenue was 15.8% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 17.2% for the first quarter of 2017.\nOur goal remains to achieve a non-compensation expense-to-operating revenue ratio over the cycle of 16% to 20%.\nTAXES\nThe provision for taxes, on an adjusted basis 1 , was $27 million for the first quarter of 2018. The effective tax rate, on an adjusted basis, was 13.9% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 26.6% for the first quarter of 2017. The first-quarter 2018 effective tax rate reflects the impact of net tax benefits relating to share-based compensation, and the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate rate from 35% to 21%.\nCAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND BALANCE SHEET\nOur primary capital management goals include managing debt and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, Lazard returned $449 million to shareholders, which included: $202 million in dividends; $146 million in share repurchases of our Class A common stock; and $101 million in satisfaction of employee tax obligations in lieu of share issuances upon vesting of equity grants.\nYear to date, we have repurchased 3.6 million shares at an average price of $54.23 per share. In line with our objectives, these repurchases have more than offset the potential dilution from our 2017 year-end equity-based compensation awards (net of estimated forfeitures and tax withholding to be paid in cash in lieu of share issuances), which were granted at an average price of $56.22 per share.\nOn April 25, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized additional share repurchases of up to $300 million, which expires as of December 31, 2020, bringing our total outstanding share repurchase authorization to $351 million.\nOn April 25, 2018, our Board of Directors voted to increase the quarterly dividend on Lazard’s outstanding Class A common stock by 7%, to $0.44 per share. The dividend is payable on May 18, 2018, to stockholders of record on May 7, 2018.\nLazard’s financial position remains strong. As of March 31, 2018, our cash and cash equivalents were $962 million, and stockholders’ equity related to Lazard’s interests was $997 million.\n***\nCONFERENCE CALL\nLazard will host a conference call at 8:00 a.m. EDT on Thursday, April 26, 2018, to discuss the company’s financial results for the first quarter of 2018.

See attached financial schedules and related notes for a detailed explanation of adjustments to corresponding U.S. GAAP results. We believe that presenting our results on an adjusted basis, in addition to the U.S. GAAP results, is the most meaningful and useful way to compare our operating results across periods.\n2 First-quarter 2018 adjusted results exclude pre-tax charges of (i) $7.4 million of costs associated with the implementation of a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, and (ii) $1.4 million of office space reorganization costs primarily relating to incremental rent expense and lease abandonment costs. On a U.S. GAAP basis, these items resulted in a net charge of $6.2 million, or $0.05 (diluted) per share, in the first quarter of 2018.\nLAZ-EPE\nFINANCIAL ADVISORY ASSIGNMENTS\nMergers and Acquisitions (Completed in the first quarter of 2018)\nAmong the large, publicly announced M&A Advisory transactions or assignments completed during the first quarter of 2018 on which Lazard advised were the following:\nSempra Energy’s acquisition of an 80% ownership interest in Oncor, valuing Oncor at $18.8 billion Calpine’s $17.1 billion sale to a consortium led by Energy Capital Partners Sanofi’s $11.6 billion acquisition of Bioverativ Safran’s €8.2 billion acquisition of Zodiac Aerospace AVEVA’s $5.2 billion combination with Schneider Electric’s industrial software business Clayton, Dubilier & Rice on their acquisition of a 40% stake in Belron, valuing Belron at €3.0 billion The Ferrero Group’s $2.8 billion acquisition of Nestlé’s U.S. confectionary business Special Committee of the Board of Directors of General Communication, Inc.

Our non-GAAP measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable U.S. GAAP measures, and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For a detailed explanation of the adjustments made to comparable U.S. GAAP measures, see Notes to Financial Schedules. LAZARD LTD Notes to Financial Schedules (a) Selected Summary Financial Information are non-GAAP measures. Lazard believes that presenting results and measures on an adjusted basis in conjunction with U.S. GAAP measures provides the most meaningful basis for comparison of its operating results across periods. (b) A non-GAAP measure which excludes (i) revenue related to non-controlling interests (see (i) below), (ii) (gains)/losses related to the changes in the fair value of investments held in connection with Lazard Fund Interests and other similar deferred compensation arrangements for which a corresponding equal amount is excluded from compensation & benefits expense, (iii) for the three month period ended March 31, 2018, revenue related to distribution fees and reimbursable deal costs in accordance with the newly adopted revenue recognition guidance and bad debt expense (see (j) below), and (iv) interest expense primarily related to corporate financing activities. (c) A non-GAAP measure which excludes (i) (charges)/credits related to the changes in the fair value of the compensation liability recorded in connection with Lazard Fund Interests and other similar deferred compensation arrangements, and (ii) compensation and benefits related to noncontrolling interests (see (i) below). (d) A non-GAAP measure which excludes (i) for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, expenses associated with ERP system implementation (see (k) below), (ii) for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, expenses related to office space reorganization (see (l) below), (iii) for the three month period ended March 31, 2018, expenses related to distribution fees and reimbursable deal costs in accordance with the newly adopted revenue recognition guidance and bad debt expense (see (j) below), (iv) amortization and other acquisition-related costs (see (m) below), and (v) expenses related to noncontrolling interests (see (i) below). (e) A non-GAAP measure which excludes (i) for the three month period ended December 31, 2017, a benefit relating to the reduction in our Tax Receivable Agreement obligation (see (n) below), (ii) for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, expenses associated with ERP system implementation (see (k) below), (iii) for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, expenses related to office space reorganization (see (l) below), (iv) amortization and other acquisition-related costs (benefits) (see (m) below), (v) net revenue and expenses related to noncontrolling interests (see (i) below), and (vi) interest expense primarily related to corporate financing activities. (f) Represents earnings from operations as a percentage of operating revenue, and is a non-GAAP measure. (g) A non-GAAP measure which excludes (i) for the three month period ended December 31, 2017, a charge primarily relating to the reduction in certain deferred tax assets with an offsetting benefit relating to the reduction in our Tax Receivable Agreement obligation (see (n) below), (ii) for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, expenses associated with ERP system implementation (see (k) below), (iii) for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, expenses related to office space reorganization (see (l) below), and (iv) amortization and other acquisition-related costs, net of tax benefits (see (m) below). (h) Effective tax rate is a non-GAAP measure based upon the U.S. GAAP rate with adjustments for the tax applicable to the non-GAAP adjustments to operating income, generally based upon the effective marginal tax rate in the applicable jurisdiction of the adjustments. The computation is based on a quotient, the numerator of which is the provision for income taxes of $26,792, $27,990, and $39,924 for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2017, respectively, and the denominator of which is pre-tax income of $192,707, $176,097, and $150,065 for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2017, respectively. The three month period ended December 31, 2017, excludes a charge relating to the reduction of deferred tax assets (see (n) below). (i) Noncontrolling interests include revenue and expenses principally related to Edgewater, and is a non-GAAP measure. (j) Represents certain distribution fees and reimbursable deal costs paid to third parties for which an equal amount is excluded from both non-GAAP operating revenue and non-compensation expense, respectively, and excludes bad debt expense, which represents fees that are deemed uncollectible. (k) Represents expenses associated with Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system implementation. (l) Represents incremental rent expense and lease abandonment costs related to office space reorganization and an onerous lease provision. (m) Represents the change in fair value of the contingent consideration associated with certain business acquisitions. (n) In 2017, as a result of the 2017 US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company incurred a charge of approximately $420 million primarily relating to the reduction in certain deferred tax assets, with an offsetting benefit of approximately $203 million relating to the reduction in our Tax Receivable Agreement obligation.
