    "text": "SOUTHERN PINES, N.C., April 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- First Bancorp (NASDAQ: FBNC), the parent company of First Bank, announced today net income available to common shareholders of $20.7 million, or $0.70 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 106% in earnings per share from the $7.6 million, or $0.34 per diluted common share, recorded in the first quarter of 2017.\nAffecting the quarter's comparability with 2017 were the Company's acquisitions of Carolina Bank Holdings, Inc. (\"Carolina Bank\") in March 2017 with total assets of $682 million and ASB Bancorp, Inc. (\"Asheville Savings Bank\") in October 2017 with $798 million in total assets. The assets, liabilities and earnings for each acquisition were recorded beginning on their respective acquisition dates.\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income for the first quarter of 2018 was $50.5 million, a 47.3% increase from the $34.3 million recorded in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to the acquisitions of Carolina Bank and Asheville Savings Bank, as well as higher amounts of loans outstanding as a result of organic growth.\nAlso contributing to the increase in net interest income was a higher net interest margin. The Company's tax-equivalent net interest margin (tax-equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets) amounted to 4.19% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 4.07% for the first quarter of 2017. Asset yields increased primarily as a result of four Federal Reserve interest rate increases since January 1, 2017. Funding costs also increased, but to a lesser degree. Also positively impacting interest income in the first quarter of 2018 was approximately $750,000 in interest recoveries, which primarily related to the same loans that experienced significant allowance for loan loss recoveries discussed below in \"Provisions for Loan Losses and Asset Quality.\"\nThe net interest margins for the periods were also impacted by loan discount accretion associated with acquired loan portfolios. The Company recorded loan discount accretion amounting to $2.1 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $1.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in loan discount accretion in 2018 was primarily due to the loan discounts recorded in the acquisitions of Carolina Bank and Asheville Savings Bank. See the Financial Summary for a table that presents the impact of loan discount accretion on net interest income.\nExcluding the effects of loan discount accretion, the Company's tax-equivalent net interest margin was 4.02% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 3.91% for the first quarter of 2017. On a linked quarter basis, the 4.02% margin was an increase from the 3.84% margin realized for the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher yields on loans and short-term investments resulting from higher interest rates. See the Financial Summary for a reconciliation of the Company's net interest margin to the net interest margin excluding loan discount accretion, and other information regarding this percentage.\nProvision for Loan Losses and Asset Quality\nThe Company recorded a negative provision for loan losses (reduction of the allowance for loan losses) of $3.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to a provision for loan losses of $0.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company experienced net loan recoveries of $3.7 million, including full payoffs received on four loans that had been previously charged-down by approximately $3.3 million. The amounts received in excess of the prior charge-downs were recorded as interest income recoveries, and those four loans were primarily responsible for the $750,000 in interest recoveries previously noted.\nThe Company's provision for loan losses have been impacted by continued improvement in asset quality. The Company's nonperforming assets to total assets ratio was 0.92% at March 31, 2018 compared to 1.35% at March 31, 2017. The ratio of annualized net charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was (0.36%), compared to 0.13% for the same period of 2017.\nNoninterest Income\nTotal noninterest income was $15.9 million and $9.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively.\nCore noninterest income for the first quarter of 2018 was $16.2 million, an increase of 65.8% from the $9.8 million reported for the first quarter of 2017. Core noninterest income includes i) service charges on deposit accounts, ii) other service charges, commissions, and fees, iii) fees from presold mortgage loans, iv) commissions from sales of insurance and financial products, v) SBA consulting fees, vi) SBA loan sale gains, and vii) bank-owned life insurance income.\nThe primary reason for the increase in core noninterest income in 2018 was an increase in SBA loan sales volume. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company sold $47.2 million of the guaranteed portions of newly originated SBA loans, which resulted in $3.8 million in gains on sales. In comparison, during the first quarter of 2017, the Company sold $7.3 million of the guaranteed portions, resulting in $0.6 million in gains on sales. Also contributing to the increase in core noninterest income in the first quarter of 2018 were the acquisitions of Carolina Bank and Asheville Savings Bank.\nCommissions from sales of insurance and financial products amounted to $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of an insurance agency during the third quarter of 2017.\nNoninterest Expenses\nNoninterest expenses amounted to $43.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $32.1 million recorded in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in noninterest expenses in 2018 related primarily to the Company's acquisitions of Carolina Bank and Asheville Savings Bank.\nAlso impacting expenses were other growth initiatives, including continued growth of the Company's SBA consulting firm and SBA lending division, as well as the acquisition of an insurance agency during the third quarter of 2017.\nOn March 16, 2018, the Company converted the data processing systems of Asheville Savings Bank to First Bank and consolidated three branches in Asheville. This is expected to result in annual expense savings of approximately $4.0 to $4.5 million.\nMerger and acquisition expenses amounted to $2.8 million and $2.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company's effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 22.0% compared to 33.2% in the first quarter of 2017. The lower effective tax rate was due to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law in December 2017 and reduced the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%.\nBalance Sheet and Capital\nTotal assets at March 31, 2018 amounted to $5.6 billion, a 27.0% increase from a year earlier. Total loans at March 31, 2018 amounted to $4.1 billion, a 25.1% increase from a year earlier, and total deposits amounted to $4.5 billion at March 31, 2018, a 23.9% increase from a year earlier.\nIn addition to the growth realized from the acquisition of Asheville Savings Bank in October 2017, the Company experienced steady organic loan and deposit growth during the first quarter of 2018. Organic loan growth amounted to $71.4 million, or 7.2% annualized, and organic deposit growth amounted to $88.8 million, or 8.2% annualized. This growth was a result of ongoing internal initiatives to enhance loan and deposit growth, including the Company's recent expansion into higher growth markets. Also impacting the first quarter deposit growth was the receipt of a $41 million money market deposit that is expected to be transferred outside the Company in the second quarter of 2018.\nThe Company remains well-capitalized by all regulatory standards, with an estimated Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio at March 31, 2018 of 12.70%, an increase from the 12.55% reported at March 31, 2017. The Company's tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.34% at March 31, 2018, an increase of 55 basis points from a year earlier.\nComments of the CEO and Other Business Matters\nRichard H. Moore, CEO of First Bancorp, commented, \"We are pleased with today's earnings report and our achievement of significant milestones over the past year. And we are especially gratified that we were able to announce a dividend increase during the quarter, which is being paid to shareholders tomorrow.\"\nThe following includes additional discussion of business development and other miscellaneous matters affecting the Company during the first quarter of 2018:\nOn March 15, 2018, the Company announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 cents per share payable on April 25, 2018 to shareholders of record on March 30, 2018. This dividend rate represents a 25% increase over the dividend rate declared in the first quarter of 2017.\nOn March 16, 2018, the Company converted the data processing systems of Asheville Savings Bank to First Bank, and the former Asheville Savings Bank branches now fully operate under the name \"First Bank.\" As part of this conversion, the Company consolidated three of its legacy Asheville branches into former Asheville Savings Bank branches.\n* * *\nFirst Bancorp is a bank holding company headquartered in Southern Pines, North Carolina, with total assets of approximately $5.6 billion.

Management of the Company believes that it is useful to calculate and present the Company's net interest margin without the impact of loan discount accretion for the reasons explained in the remainder of this paragraph. Loan discount accretion is a non-cash interest income adjustment that is primarily related to the Company's acquisition of loans and represents the portion of the fair value discount that was initially recorded on the acquired loans that is being recognized into income over the lives of the loans. At March 31, 2018, the Company had a remaining loan discount balance of $26.2 million compared to $19.6 million at March 31, 2017. For the related loans that perform and pay-down over time, the loan discount will also be reduced, with a corresponding increase to interest income. Therefore management of the Company believes it is useful to also present this ratio to reflect the Company's net interest margin excluding this non-cash, temporary loan discount accretion adjustment to aid investors in comparing financial results between periods. The Company cautions that non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the Company's reported GAAP results.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/first-bancorp-reports-first-quarter-results-300635766.html\nSOURCE First Bancorp",
