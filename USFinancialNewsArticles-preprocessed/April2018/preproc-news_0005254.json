    "text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass., April 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Spero Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:SPRO), a multi-asset, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on identifying, developing and commercializing novel treatments for multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacterial infections, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full 2017 and provided a pipeline update.\n“In 2017, we made significant progress with the completion of our IPO in November and advancement of our pipeline highlighted by the initiation of the SPR994 Phase 1 trial and SPR741 Phase 1b trial,” said Ankit Mahadevia, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Spero Therapeutics. “We expect this momentum to continue during 2018 with several important catalysts, including a Phase 3 trial initiation for SPR994 around year-end 2018 and data from our pipeline compounds, all of which address the critical need for novel anti-infective therapies to current and emerging drug-resistant infections.”\nRecent Clinical Highlights and Upcoming Milestones\nSPR994:\nThe Company’s most advanced product candidate, SPR994, is designed to be the first broad-spectrum oral carbapenem-class antibiotic for use in adults to treat MDR Gram-negative infections. Spero initiated a Phase 1 study in healthy subjects in October 2017 to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of SPR994. The Company continues to expect top-line data from this trial in mid-2018 that will enable dose selection for the planned Phase 3 clinical trial. Following a pre-Phase 3 meeting with the FDA in the second half of 2018, Spero plans to initiate a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of SPR994 for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) around year-end 2018 in support of a new drug application (NDA).\nPotentiator Platform (SPR741 and SPR206):\nSpero’s potentiator platform is an innovative approach to treating MDR Gram-negative bacterial infections and includes two compounds, SPR741 and SPR206. Both product candidates within the potentiator program are advancing, and Spero expects to bring forward a candidate from this program for further clinical testing in 2018.\nSPR741 is an IV-administered agent designed to expand the spectrum and increase the potency of a partner antibiotic when administered in combination. In November 2017, Spero initiated a Phase 1b drug-drug interaction trial of SPR741 in healthy volunteers as a single dose in combination with compounds from the beta-lactam class of antibiotics. The trial assesses the impact, if any, on the standalone pharmacokinetics of SPR741 or the standalone pharmacokinetics of the beta-lactam combination drug when the two are dosed together as a single dose. The Company anticipates top-line data from this Phase 1b trial during the second quarter of 2018.\nSPR206 is designed to have antibiotic activity as a single agent against MDR and extremely drug resistant (XDR) bacterial strains and multiple susceptibility testing studies suggests that SPR206 is capable of potent activity against MDR Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumanii. The Company expects to have additional data from ongoing preclinical studies in the second quarter of 2018.\nSPR720:\nSPR720 is an oral antibiotic designed for the treatment of an orphan disease, pulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infections. SPR720 has shown activity in in vitro and in vivo studies as good or better than positive controls, including in an acute model infection caused by Mycobacterium abscessus murine pneumonia. It is currently in preclinical testing and, pending results from additional toxicity studies, Spero plans to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in the first half of 2019.\nFourth Quarter and Full-year 2017 Financial Results\nThe Company reported a net loss for the fourth quarter and 2017 of $14.8 million and $46.1 million, or $1.59 and $17.82 per common share, respectively. Net loss for the fourth quarter and 2016 was $8.3 million and $29.9 million, or $25.68 and $95.87 per common share, respectively.\nGrant revenue for the fourth quarter and 2017 totaled $1.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively, and is comprised of reimbursement of SPR741 and SPR720 program expenses. Grant revenue for the 2017 was $1.6 million higher than the same period of 2016 due to an increase in available awards as well as a greater reimbursable spend on our product candidates.\nResearch and development expenses for the fourth quarter 2017 were $12.5 million compared to $6.9 million for the same period of 2016 as expenses increased with pipeline advancement, including the initiations of the SPR994 Phase 1 trial and SPR741 Phase 1b trial. Research and development expenses for the 2017 were $32.9 million compared to $26.3 million for the 2016, with increased expenses in 2017 primarily related to costs associated with formulation development and manufacturing of clinical material offset by lower preclinical program expense. Research and development expense in 2017 included $1.6 million in fees to Meiji Seika Pharma Co. related to SPR994 development and in-licensing and $2.6 million to Northern Antibiotics OY related to SPR741 development. The Company expects that its research and development expenses will increase throughout 2018 as it incurs costs related to its planned clinical and preclinical development activities, including the SPR994 Phase 3 trial that it plans to initiate around year-end 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter 2017 were $2.5 million compared to $2.2 million for the same period of 2016, with the increase primarily due to greater costs associated with operating as a public company and our initial public offering. General and administrative expenses for the 2017 were $10.8 million compared to $7.2 million for the 2016, with increased expenses in 2017 mainly due to increased headcount and higher professional fees. The Company expects general and administrative expenses to increase in 2018 with additional headcount and professional fees to support its research and development efforts and greater costs associated with operating as a public company.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $87.3 million. Spero believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents will fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2019. In early November 2017, Spero completed its initial public offering in which it issued a total of approximately 6.0 million shares of common stock at a public offering price of $14.00 per share, for net proceeds after discounts and expenses of $74.2 million. As of December 31, 2017, the Company is receiving funding support of up to an aggregate of $10.1 million from government sources and it continues to seek additional non-dilutive funding opportunities.\nUpcoming Scientific and Investor Presentations\nCorporate presentation at the H.
