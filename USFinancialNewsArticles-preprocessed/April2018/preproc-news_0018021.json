Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the benefits of the merger, including future financial and operating results, and the combined company’s plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Any statements that are not statements of historical fact, including statements containing such words as “will,” “could,” “plans,” “intends,” “expect,” “believe,” “view,” “opportunity,” “allow,” “continues,” “reflects,” “typically,” “anticipate,” “estimated,” or similar expressions, should also be considered forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Readers should not place undue influence on these forward-looking statements, which are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of the management of 1 ST Constitution and NJCB. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results might differ materially from those discussed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements.\nThere are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements, including the factors described in the 1 ST Constitution 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on March 19, 2018. Although management has taken certain steps to mitigate any negative effect of the aforementioned items, significant unfavorable changes could severely impact the assumptions used and could have an adverse effect on profitability.\n1 ST Constitution undertakes no obligation to update, alter, or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nContact: Robert F.
