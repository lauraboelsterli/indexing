    "text": "(Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Wednesday said it encouraged the U.S. and Chinese governments to “work together to resolve issues” after China retaliated against U.S. plans to impose tariffs with a list of similar duties.\nThe Ford logo is pictured on the company's stand during the 88th Geneva International Motor Show in Geneva, Switzerland, March 7, 2018. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo “We encourage both governments to work together to resolve issues between these two important economies,” Ford said in a statement.\nResponding to tariffs imposed by the Trump government less than 11 hours later, China issued a list of duties on key American imports including soybeans, planes, cars, beef and chemicals in a move that sent global markets lower.\nReporting By Aparajita Saxena in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta\n ",
