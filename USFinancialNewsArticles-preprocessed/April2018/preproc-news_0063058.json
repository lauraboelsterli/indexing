    "text": "AIKEN, S.C., April 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Security Federal Corporation (“Company”) (OTCBB:SFDL), the holding company for Security Federal Bank (“Bank”), today announced earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Net income increased $101,000 or 6.2% to $1.7 million or $0.59 per common share (basic) for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $1.6 million or $0.55 per common share (basic) for the same period in 2017. The increase in earnings was primarily the result of an increase in net interest income combined with a decrease in the provision for income tax expense. These items were partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense.\nThe Company’s net interest spread increased two basis points to 3.22% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to 3.20% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Consistent with the increase in the interest spread, net interest income increased $559,000 or 9.3% to $6.6 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $6.0 million during the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of loans and mortgage backed securities combined with higher yields earned from these assets during the first quarter of 2018. The increase in these average earning assets was partially offset by higher cost of funds as total interest expense increased $211,000 or 22.0% to $1.2 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $958,000 for the same quarter in 2017. The majority of the increase in interest expense was related to interest expense on deposits, which increased $168,000 or 29.6% to $736,000 during the first quarter of 2018 compared to $568,000 during the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-interest income increased $47,000 or 2.3% to $2.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. Non-interest expense increased $690,000 or 11.8% to $6.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $5.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The most significant increase was in salaries and employee benefits expense, which increased $298,000 or 8.5%.\nTotal assets increased $2.9 million or 0.3% to $871.7 million at March 31, 2018 from $868.8 million at December 31, 2017. Investment and mortgage-backed securities decreased $28.9 million or 7.0% to $383.1 million at March 31, 2018 from $412.1 million at December 31, 2017. Net loans receivable grew $26.0 million or 6.7% to $416.5 million at March 31, 2018 from $390.5 million at December 31, 2017. Total deposits increased $14.6 million or 2.1% to $716.7 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $702.1 million at December 31, 2017.\nThe Bank’s newest branch in Ridge Spring, South Carolina opened in March 2018. It is a full-service branch offering depository banking as well as commercial and consumer lending.\nSecurity Federal Bank has 16 full service branch locations in Aiken, Ballentine, Clearwater, Columbia, Graniteville, Langley, Lexington, North Augusta, Ridge Spring, Wagener, and West Columbia, South Carolina and Evans, Georgia. A full range of financial services, including trust and investments, are provided by the Bank and insurance services are provided by the Bank’s wholly owned subsidiary, Security Federal Insurance, Inc.\nForward-looking statements :\nCertain matters discussed in this press release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
