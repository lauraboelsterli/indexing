    "text": "PHILADELPHIA, Pa. and OXFORD, U.K., April 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Adaptimmune Therapeutics plc (Nasdaq:ADAP), a leader in T-cell therapy to treat cancer, today announced that, in a planned transition, John Furey has been appointed as an independent Non-Executive Director, and Peter Thompson, M.D., Ph.D., will be stepping down from the Board. Both changes are effective from July 5, 2018. Mr. Furey will also succeed Dr. Thompson as a member of the Remuneration Committee. Dr. Thompson has served as a Non-Executive Director of Adaptimmune since September 2014.\n“Peter’s deep oncology expertise and broad experience of building companies has been invaluable as we moved towards being a fully-integrated T-cell therapy company. On behalf of the Board and management, I want to thank him for his support and contribution over the past four years,” said James Noble, Adaptimmune’s Chief Executive Officer. “As we move towards commercialization, John has the optimal experience to assist us.”\n“I am delighted to welcome John to the Board,” commented David Mott, Adaptimmune’s Chairman. “His substantial experience and strategic expertise across operational and commercial areas will be particularly valuable as the Company progresses toward pivotal trials, and plans to make the first treatment available to cancer patients.”\nJohn Furey said: “I am absolutely delighted to join Adaptimmune at this exciting time. Its leadership position in the field of TCR T-cell therapy offers great potential for cancer patients. I look forward to working with the Board and the management team to support advancement of the Company’s clinical programs, while getting it ready for the next stages of commercialization.”\nJohn Furey is Chief Operating Officer at Spark Therapeutics, Inc. He is responsible for global commercial operations, medical affairs, technology development and technical operations. He has 25 years of experience in developing and implementing operational strategies and leading commercial and technical teams. Prior to joining Spark Therapeutics, John was senior vice president and head of global operations for Baxalta, where he directed manufacturing, quality, engineering, and process development. He actively managed a $2.5 billion production budget across Baxalta’s global network and led a first-in-class supply chain organization for rare diseases. John led the team that coordinated and delivered the successful establishment of Baxalta through a spin out from Baxter and led the Baxter Vaccine inline business to realize significant top line and bottom line growth. He also spent two years in China as general manager of Pfizer’s vaccine business unit following a role with responsibility for global pricing and reimbursement at Pfizer Vaccines. In these roles, John gained extensive experience in pipeline development and global product launches. Earlier in his career, he held both commercial and operations positions of increasing scope and responsibility with Pfizer and Wyeth Pharmaceuticals. John has an executive M.B.A. from St. Joseph’s University, Philadelphia, a B.S. from Trinity College, Dublin, and a diploma in Environmental Health from the Dublin Institute of Technology.\nAbout Adaptimmune\nAdaptimmune is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel cancer immunotherapy products.
