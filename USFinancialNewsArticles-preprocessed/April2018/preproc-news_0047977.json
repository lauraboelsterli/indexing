(the \"Company\") (TSXV:OML) (OTCQX:OLNCF) is pleased to announce audited annual revenue of US$6,539,934. Total bookings for fiscal year 2017 were US$6,726,533, yielding a book-to bill ratio of 1.03. In the 2017 fiscal period, cash flow from operations increased to US$2,083,701 versus US$1,965,273 in fiscal year 2016, a gain of 6%. Free Cash Flow generated in fiscal year 2017 increased 13% to US$954,366. Gross margin, as adjusted, for fiscal year 2017 increased approximately 400 basis points, to 58.3% (excluding one-time provisions).\nIn 2017, the Company successfully received 4 new aerospace component approvals from one of our largest aerospace customers and is in active design and initial production on 8 additional components. All 12 components will be added to our current multiyear contract with this customer. “These orders complement the family of parts mentioned in two previous press releases during 2017. These new orders are indicative of the trend of large integrated tier one aerospace suppliers outsourcing to nimble, high technology companies like Omni-Lite,” stated Allen W. Maxin, President.\nIn addition, during the fiscal year, the Company continued to receive a number of military contracts that continue the important U.S. Department of Defense programs that began in 2014. These are the fourth and fifth set of contiguous orders in this program. These aerospace and military contracts continue to represent a tremendous vote of confidence in the state of the art engineering and manufacturing facility that the Company has built in Southern California and point towards growth in 2018 and beyond as the Company becomes more strategic to the customers it is servicing. The Company will continue its efforts to focus growth in these higher margin Aerospace and Military areas.\nThe Company is also pleased to announce it has received new contract orders worth in excess of US$721,000 since our last press release on February 20, 2018. Of these orders, 52% are in the Aerospace Division, 34% are in the Specialty Automotive Division, and 14% are in the Sports and Recreational Division. Of significant note, in the Aerospace Division, the Company received its second Titanium component order to be produced on its new Hot Forging system.\nThe Company would also like to note that the white reflective roof coating and the large solar energy system has been completed and is operational. The solar energy system was brought online approximately 30 days ago and have experienced a significant decrease in power usage with a resulting 30% savings in our utility cost.\nFinally, in fiscal year 2017, the Company repurchased 353,600 shares of our common stock under its Normal Course Issuer Bid, representing in excess of 3% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares.\nFinancial Highlights\nRevenue : For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, Omni-Lite reported revenue of US$6,539,934.\nSales by division are summarized below:\nDivision Aerospace Military\nSpecialty Automotive\nSports &\nRecreation\n2017 37 % 24 % 25 % 14 % 2016 40% 15% 34% 11% Earnings Per Share: Basic earnings per share were US$0.07 compared to US$0.07 generated in fiscal year 2016 based on the weighted average shares outstanding of 10,255,472 in fiscal year 2017 and 10,911,638 in fiscal year 2016.
