    "text": "European Investment Bank, AfDB back new Nigerian lender Published 11:26 AM ET Thu, 19 April 2018 Reuters \nABUJA, April 19 (Reuters) - The European Investment Bank has finalised a $20 million equity stake in a new Nigerian-backed development bank set up to boost lending to small businesses and agriculture. \nThe African Development Bank (AfDB) will also invest $50 million in the Development Bank of Nigeria, the two development lenders said in a statement. \nThe new Nigerian bank - modelled on Germany's KfW - will lend to local commercial banks and micro-finance institutions that will in turn make loans to small firms, helping to boost economic growth and jobs.
