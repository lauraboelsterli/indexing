A group of Central American migrants, moving in a caravan through Mexico, get on a microbus to get to the office of Mexico's National Institute of Migration to start the legal process and get temporary residence status for humanitarian reasons, in Hermosillo, Sonora state, Mexico April 24, 2018. REUTERS/Edgard Garrido \nBy evening, two busloads of men, women and children arrived in Tijuana, a city that grazes southern California. \nU.S. President Donald Trump has ordered officials to repel them. \nThe arrivals spilled into the streets and gazed towards San Diego, visible at spots through a rusty barrier or across a pedestrian bridge, exhausted after their trek that began a month ago near Mexico’s southern border with Guatemala.

REUTERS/Edgard Garrido \nAnother four busloads were making their way north from Hermosillo, a city 432 miles south of the border, where the migrants had been stalled for days. \nMany who fled their homes in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras because of what they described as lethal threats or political persecution have clung to the hope of receiving asylum in the United States. But their prospects dimmed after U.S. authorities released statements on Monday saying they would driven back.
