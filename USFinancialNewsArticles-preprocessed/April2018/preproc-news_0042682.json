    "text": "New Company to Focus On Best-in-Class Service, Strategic Expansion and an Advanced Technology Platform to be Unveiled This Fall\nWOODLAND HILLS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Omni Management, the originator of corporate restructuring case management services nearly 50 years ago, announced today that existing management, Marc Beilinson, and affiliates of the Beilinson Advisory Group have purchased Omni Management Group from Rust Consulting. The new company, to be known as Omni Management Group , will provide enhanced services to restructuring professionals with personal and professional consulting services, new information management tools to ease case administration, and refined networking and research resources to help uncover new business opportunities.\nBeilinson Advisory Group will provide strategic support and resources to Omni’s existing management. Marc Beilinson will remain as chairman of the parent company. He is known for serving in high-profile bankruptcy cases as a chief restructuring officer (CRO), independent director and former partner at Pachulski, Stang, Ziehl & Jones LLP. New directors of Omni will be fellow Beilinson Advisory Group colleagues Mark Murphy, an attorney with restructuring and public equity experience, and turnaround professional Rick Kapko, CPA, CFE, CIRA, who brings more than 30 years of financial, operational and restructuring expertise.\nBrian Osborne, a 30-year corporate restructuring veteran who has worked with the company for nearly 15 years, will serve as CEO. Joining Osborne as senior vice president will be Paul H. Deutch, a former bankruptcy attorney who opened Omni’s New York office in 2009.\n“Having been involved in all facets of the bankruptcy space for 35 years, I have always wanted to improve the claims and case management process,” Beilinson stated. “I’ve known Brian for 25 years, and this transaction presented the right opportunity to join forces and make smart investments in systems, people and processes, and to create a product that is unsurpassed and easily utilized by bankruptcy professionals.” He continued: “We’re not a marketing organization. Our focus is on reinvesting in the company and delivering exceptional value with the highest level of service.”\n“Over the years, I have witnessed the growth of the claims management business,” Osborne stated. “We have always operated differently than our corporate-style competitors because we focus on providing the most efficient and cost-effective service possible. Joining forces with Beilinson Advisory Group will allow us to fully realize our vision and exceed our clients’ expectations, delivering exceptional service, new intuitive technologies and proactive, cost-effective results.”\nOsborne went on to note that Omni has been involved in more than 2,500 projects during its 50 years in business, including some of the country’s largest chapter 11 matters. Several recent major chapter 11 restructuring cases include Charming Charlie, Philadelphia Energy Solutions, Memorial Production Partners, ITT Educational Services, and 4 West Holdings dba Oriana Health Systems, which included more than 130 debtors. In addition, Omni has successfully provided bankruptcy administration services for such bankruptcy cases as Owens Corning, Pacific Gas & Electric, Refco, Mervyns, as well as the cities of Stockton and San Bernardino, Calif.\nOsborne summarized, “We are very excited about our new partnership. We intend to help our clients to perform their business more intelligently. It’s not enough to carry out the duties of the claims and noticing agent for our clients. We have to be a total information management solution. That’s our focus, and that’s how we can become our clients’ best friends in business.”\nAbout Omni Management\nOmni Management is the originator of the claims management and plan administration services in corporate bankruptcy cases.
