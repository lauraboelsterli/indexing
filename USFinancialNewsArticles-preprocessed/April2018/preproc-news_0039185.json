    "text": "(Reuters) - American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ) said it has formed two new entities in Luxembourg and the UK to ensure little disruption to the company’s insurance coverage in Europe when Britain exits the European Union.\nAmerican International Group Inc. (AIG) headquarters seen on the day of the company's 2017 annual shareholder meeting at 175 Water Street, New York, U.S., June 28, 2017. REUTERS/Suzanne Barlyn/File Photo The insurer currently writes business in Europe from UK-based insurance company AIG Europe Ltd, and has branches across the European Economic Area and Switzerland.\nAIG said it would transfer AIG Europe Ltd’s existing insurance business to the UK and Luxembourg units.\n“The great advantage of the restructuring route we have chosen is that it will give clients certainty that whatever the other unknowns of Brexit for their businesses, their European insurance coverage has been Brexit-proofed,” AIG Europe Ltd Chief Executive Officer Anthony Baldwin said in a statement.\nAIG joins a growing list of financial companies that plan to shift some operations to continental Europe to maintain links to customers after Brexit.\nThe new AIG companies will begin writing business Dec. 1.\nReporting By Aparajita Saxena in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva\n ",
