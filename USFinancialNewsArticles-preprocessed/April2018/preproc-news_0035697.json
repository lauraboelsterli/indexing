This compares to $7.2 million during the fiscal third quarter and a 0.5:1 book-to-bill ratio and $5.8 million during the fiscal second quarter, which also represented a 0.5:1 book-to-bill ratio.\nDarren Jamison, President and Chief Executive Officer of Capstone, stated, “Our preliminary product bookings of $14.5 million and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3:1 during the fourth quarter underscores our ability to drive revenue growth and the market’s accelerating adoption of Capstone’s energy solutions across diverse markets. Continuing this momentum into the new fiscal year is my primary focus as we continue to leverage our new bundled solutions program, long-term service offerings and revenue opportunities in new geographies such as Latin America, Africa and the Middle East,” added Mr. Jamison.\nTotal preliminary revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was approximately $21 million making total revenue for fiscal 2018 approximately $83 million, a 7% increase from a year ago when Capstone recorded revenues of $77.2 million. These preliminary results indicate that Capstone has returned to year-over-year revenue growth after three years of consecutively lower revenues due to multiple macroeconomic headwinds.\n“During the fourth quarter and year-to-date, Capstone continues to secure new product orders from an increasingly diverse distribution channel, including global tier one clients, key oil and gas producers and top-ranking commercial facilities,” Mr. Jamison added.\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of March 31, 2018, were approximately $19.4 million, compared to $16.5 million as of December 31, 2017. Cash usage during fiscal 2018, excluding net proceeds from equity transactions and the change in the line of credit, was $8.5 million lower compared to fiscal 2017, representing a 44% reduction. Additionally, Capstone generated cash of $0.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, excluding net proceeds from equity transactions and the change in the line of credit, compared to cash usage of $2.8 million for the same period last year.\n“The past fiscal year has benefited from our cash management strategy and has recently delivered positive cash flow for the quarter, excluding net proceeds from equity transactions and the pay down of the line of credit. We are executing on our strategy that continues to deliver results including higher margin revenue from our accessories, parts and service business and tight operating expense controls, which has led to meaningful improvements in our quarterly cash flows,” said Jayme Brooks, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer of Capstone.\nCapstone also announced that borrowings on its asset based revolving credit facility decreased approximately $2.5 million during the quarter to $8.5 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to $11.0 million at the end of the prior quarter and that it received approximately $5.2 million from equity transactions during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.\n“We continue to focus on maintaining a very low operating expense level, while targeting key strategic areas to increase spending that will help drive revenue growth. I believe the recently announced Distributor Support System (DSS) program is a great example of this initiative as it provides additional funding for business development activities, customer lead generation, brand awareness and tailored marketing services without significantly increasing our operating expenses,” added Ms. Brooks.\n“We have an excellent foundation from which we will continue to build our momentum into fiscal 2019. Capstone entered the new fiscal year from a position of strength and focused on growth with a strong order book, improved margins, lower operating expenses, an improving balance sheet and a more focused spend on marketing to drive sales. We are also seeing increasing benefits from our innovative aftermarket service businesses, which helps to build a predictable revenue base and drive margin expansion,” concluded Mr. Jamison.\nThe select financial results presented in this press release are preliminary and may change.
