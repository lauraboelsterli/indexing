Our portfolio of rental assets continues to consistently produce reliable cash flow for our shareholders. On April 16, 2018, we announced an exciting transaction to acquire the real estate assets of Tropicana Entertainment (“Tropicana”). We are acquiring 6 regional gaming facilities with an aggregate of 350,000 square feet of gaming space for $1.21 billion, exclusive of taxes and transaction fees of approximately $40.0 million. The transaction will grow our rental income by $110 million and the rent coverage is expected to be not less than 1.85 times as defined by the lease. We are excited to partner with Eldorado Resorts, Inc. (NASDAQ:ERI), a highly-respected operator of a large portfolio of regional gaming assets, in order to complete this transaction. The addition of ERI to our tenant base further diversifies our rent stream and gives us another potential partner to work with on future opportunities.”\nThe Company’s first quarter net income, AFFO and Adjusted EBITDA as compared to guidance were primarily impacted by results from the TRS Properties which were unfavorable to guidance by $0.8 million.\nPortfolio Update\nGLPI owns over 4,400 acres of land and approximately 15 million square feet of building space, which was 100% occupied as of March 31, 2018.

Two of the gaming facilities, located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Perryville, Maryland, are owned and operated by a subsidiary of GLPI, GLP Holdings, Inc., (collectively, the “TRS Properties”).\nCapital maintenance expenditures for the Company were $0.8 million for the three 2018.\nBalance Sheet Update\nThe Company had $45.4 million of unrestricted cash and $4.4 billion in total debt, including $1.0 billion of debt outstanding under its unsecured credit facility term loans and no outstanding balance under its unsecured credit facility revolver at March 31, 2018.

The Company believes FFO, AFFO, and Adjusted EBITDA provide a meaningful perspective of the underlying operating performance of the Company’s current business. This is especially true since these measures exclude real estate depreciation, and we believe that real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight-line basis over time. In addition, in order for the Company to qualify as a REIT, it must distribute 90% of its REIT taxable income annually. The Company adjusts AFFO accordingly to provide our investors an estimate of taxable income for this distribution requirement. Direct financing lease adjustments represent the portion of cash rent we receive from tenants that is applied against our lease receivable and thus not recorded as revenue and the amortization of land rights represents the non-cash amortization of the value assigned to the Company's assumed ground leases.\nFFO, AFFO and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures, that are considered a supplemental measure for the real estate industry and a supplement to GAAP measures. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), excluding (gains) or losses from sales of property and real estate depreciation. We have defined AFFO as FFO excluding stock based compensation expense, debt issuance costs amortization, other depreciation, amortization of land rights, straight-line rent adjustments and direct financing lease adjustments, reduced by capital maintenance expenditures. Finally, we have defined Adjusted EBITDA as net income excluding interest, taxes on income, depreciation, (gains) or losses from sales of property, stock based compensation expense, straight-line rent adjustments, direct financing lease adjustments and the amortization of land rights.\nFFO, AFFO and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP. Because certain companies do not calculate FFO, AFFO, and Adjusted EBITDA in the same way and certain other companies may not perform such calculation, those measures as used by other companies may not be consistent with the way the Company calculates such measures and should not be considered as alternative measures of operating profit or net income. The Company’s presentation of these measures does not replace the presentation of the Company’s financial results in accordance with GAAP.\nAbout Gaming and Leisure Properties\nGLPI is engaged in the business of acquiring, financing, and owning real estate property to be leased to gaming operators in triple-net lease arrangements, pursuant to which the tenant is responsible for all facility maintenance, insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties, taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties and all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties. GLPI expects to grow its portfolio by pursuing opportunities to acquire additional gaming facilities to lease to gaming operators. GLPI also intends to diversify its portfolio over time, including by acquiring properties outside the gaming industry to lease to third parties. GLPI elected to be taxed as a REIT for United States federal income tax purposes commencing with the 2014 taxable year and is the first gaming-focused REIT in North America.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes “ ” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements regarding our financial outlook for the second quarter of 2018 and the full 2018 fiscal year; our expectations regarding future acquisitions, the expected impact of our proposed acquisition of the real estate assets of Tropicana, and dividend payments.
