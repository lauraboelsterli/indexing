    "text": "BRASILIA, April 17 (Reuters) - The Brazilian government will seek congressional approval for the privatization of utility Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA, known as Eletrobras, via a share offering instead of an outright sale, its political affairs minister said on Tuesday.\nMinister Carlos Marun said the dilution of state control of Brazilâ€™s largest utility would be done by decree or some other executive measure that does not require the passage of a new law. The government has hoped to raise 12 billion reais ($3.5 billion) from the privatization. ($1 = 3.4027 reais) (Reporting by Anthony Boadle)\n ",
