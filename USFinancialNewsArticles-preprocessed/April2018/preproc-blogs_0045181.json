Executives at U.S. and Chinese technology firms are faced by new challenges, as the trade spat between Washington and Beijing affects companies’ deal making, sales and supply chains, write the WSJ’s Yoko Kubota and Dan Strumpf. ZTE Corp. and Qualcomm Inc. are two companies caught in the crosshairs of the dispute.\nQualcomm is confronted by a potential stumbling block for its purchase of NXP Semiconductors NV, as Chinese antitrust regulators on Thursday warned that they have “hard to resolve” concerns about the deal.\nThe move follows a decision by the U.S. Commerce Department to ban sales of American components to Chinese telecommunications company ZTE, as well as threats from the White House to levy tariffs on $150 billion worth of Chinese goods in response to concerns about the treatment of intellectual property rights.\nZTE is forced to assess whether it must — or even can — replace key components such as semiconductors supplied by Qualcomm and the Android mobile operating system it uses, made by Alphabet Inc.’s Google, write Mr. Strumpf and Newley Purnell. While locked out of the market for networking technology, ZTE has grown its smartphone business, which is now the fourth largest among U.S. consumers.\nTHE DAY AHEAD \nGeneral Electric Co. , Honeywell International Inc. , Procter & Gamble Co. , State Street Corp. and Schlumberger Ltd. are among the companies slated to report earnings today.\nCFO JOURNAL EXCLUSIVE \nBritish pest control firm Rentokil Initial seeks U.S. targets.

It already has completed 12 such transactions in the first quarter, five of those in the U.S., Mr. Townsend said.\n“Half of the world’s pest control [market] is in North America,” Mr. Townsend said Thursday in an interview with CFO Journal. “There are new pests occurring in the U.S. all the time.”\nCORPORATE NEWS \nA sign at Uber’s headquarters in San Francisco, Calif., U.S. Zuma Press Uber chooses VMware’s Rowe as top CFO candidate.

Carlos Ghosn, chairman and chief executive of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, said he is open to a merger of Renault and Nissan — something he has rejected for a long time — but added that there may be other alternatives once he eventually retires.\nREGULATION \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg arrives to testify before a Senate Judiciary and Commerce Committees joint hearing in Washington, D.C., U.S., April 10, 2018. Reuters Audit cleared Facebook’s privacy practices after leak.
