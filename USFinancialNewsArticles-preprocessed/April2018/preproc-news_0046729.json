Excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets, non-GAAP gross margin was 69.8% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 66.4% in the prior year period.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $137 million compared to $145 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 17.5%, including 0.8% attributable to Helix. This compares to non-GAAP R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue of 23.3% in the prior year period, including 2.1% attributable to GRAIL and Helix.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $183 million compared to $171 million in the prior year period. Excluding restructuring and amortization of acquired intangible assets, SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 22.9%, including 1.1% attributable to Helix. This compares to 25.6% in the prior year period, including 1.5% attributable to GRAIL and Helix.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses were $39 million and capital expenditures for free cash flow purposes were $90 million during the first quarter of 2018. At the close of the quarter, the company held $2.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, compared to $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2017.\n“Our strong first quarter, with momentum across both our sequencing and microarray businesses, was driven by the growing adoption of applications spanning oncology, clinical and non-clinical research, population genomics and personal genomics,” said Francis deSouza, President and CEO. “Genomic information is more valuable and actionable than ever before and we believe that we are in the earliest stages of a genomics revolution.”\nUpdates since our last earnings release:\nReleased the NovaSeq S1 flow cell reagent kit for the NovaSeq 6000 System Received a product approval certificate for the NextSeq™ 550Dx instrument with the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) in South Korea Announced a collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb to utilize Illumina’s next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to develop and globally commercialize in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) assays in support of Bristol-Myers Squibb’s oncology portfolio Announced a partnership with Loxo Oncology to develop and commercialize a multi-gene panel for broad tumor profiling, targeting a distributable, NGS-based companion diagnostic (CDx) with a pan-cancer indication Launched a study with Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, a not-for-profit health services company, designed to gather data intended to support wider average-risk patient access and reimbursement of NGS for non-invasive prenatal testing Appointed Dr. Phil Febbo to the position of Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer\nFinancial outlook and guidance\nThe non-GAAP financial guidance discussed below reflects certain pro forma adjustments to assist in analyzing and assessing our core operational performance. Please see our Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Guidance included in this release for a reconciliation of the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.\nFor fiscal 2018, the company now projects 15% to 16% revenue growth, GAAP earnings per diluted share attributable to Illumina stockholders of $4.45 to $4.55 and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share attributable to Illumina stockholders of $4.75 to $4.85.\nQuarterly conference call information\nThe conference call will begin at 2:00 pm Pacific Time (5:00 pm Eastern Time) on Tuesday, April 24, 2018.

Management has excluded the effects of these items in non-GAAP measures to assist investors in analyzing and assessing past and future operating performance. Additionally, non-GAAP net income attributable to Illumina stockholders and diluted earnings per share attributable to Illumina stockholders are key components of the financial metrics utilized by the company’s board of directors to measure, in part, management’s performance and determine significant elements of management’s compensation.\nThe company encourages investors to carefully consider its results under GAAP, as well as its supplemental non-GAAP information and the reconciliation between these presentations, to more fully understand its business. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results are presented in the tables of this release.\nUse of\nThis release contains that involve risks and uncertainties, including our financial outlook and guidance for fiscal 2018 and expectations regarding the development and commercialization of new products.
