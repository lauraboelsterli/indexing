    "text": "0 COMMENTS TORONTO—The Toronto Stock Exchange closed early on Friday after a technical glitch shut down all trading on Canada’s largest equity market.\nTMX Group Ltd. X 1.87% announced the early close roughly an hour and a half after trading stopped at 1:39 p.m. The market operator said “an internal technical issue” affected the Toronto exchange, the TSX Venture Exchange, the TSX Alpha Exchange and the Montreal Exchange, forcing the early closure of all the bourses.\nOne banker at a large Canadian bank said trading continued on other exchanges, including Nasdaq Inc. -owned Chi-X Canada.\nFollowing the outage, Canadian stock-trading volumes were down by more than half, said Doug Clark, a Toronto-based managing director at brokerage Investment Technology Group Inc.\nThe exchange said in a statement that instead of a normal end-of-day price, it would publish a complete list of closing prices based on the last traded price before its markets went down.\nThat could cause some noise in the system, because some investors may have prescheduled trades for a market close that technically didn’t happen, said one banker. But he said volumes on Fridays are generally low and the lack of market-moving news on a slow day will mute any impact.\n“This may lead to some funny changes at the close, but it’s not a big deal,” he said.\n—Alexander Osipovich contributed to this article.\nWrite to Vipal Monga at vipal.monga@wsj.com",
