    "text": "LEBANON, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- LCNB Corp. (\"LCNB\") (NASDAQ: LCNB) today announced net income of $2,713,000 (total basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.27) for the three months ended March 31, 2018. This compares to net income of $3,246,000 (total basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.32) for the same three-month period in 2017. Items significantly affecting net income during the 2018 period were:\nexpenses relating to the pending merger with Columbus First Bancorp, Inc. (\"Columbus First\") totaling $758,000, and a reduction in LCNB's federal tax rate from 34% to 21% as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on December 22, 2017.\nCommenting on the financial results, LCNB Chief Executive Officer Steve Foster said, \"We are pleased to report our financial results for the first quarter 2018, including increased net interest and non-interest income as compared with the first quarter 2017, loan portfolio growth during 2018, and continued excellent credit quality. Net income for the quarter was less than last year due to merger-related expenses for the pending acquisition of Columbus First Bancorp, Inc. Eliminating this item from the income statement produces pro-forma net income of $3,334,000, which is an $88,000 increase over the first quarter 2017. In addition, we look forward to finalizing our pending merger with Columbus First and welcoming their shareholders, depositors, and borrowers to LCNB. This acquisition will strengthen our presence in the desirable Columbus, Ohio market area and open up new markets as we provide Columbus First's customers with a broader array of banking and investment services.\"\nNet interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $201,000 greater than the comparable period in 2017, primarily due to growth in LCNB's loan portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in average investment securities and a market-driven increase in average rates paid on deposits and short-term borrowings.\nThe provision for loan losses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $64,000 greater than the comparable period in 2017. Non-accrual loans and loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest decreased $75,000, from $2,965,000 or 0.35% of total loans at December 31, 2017, to $2,890,000 or 0.34% of total loans at March 31, 2018.\nNon-interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $206,000 greater than the comparable periods in 2017 primarily due to increases in fiduciary income and service charges and fees on deposit accounts.\nNon-interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $1,581,000 greater than the comparable period in 2017 primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits, merger-related expenses, and various expenses related to the new operations center. Merger-related expenses increased due to costs connected to the pending acquisition of Columbus First. Subject to customary regulatory approvals, LCNB and Columbus First shareholder approvals, and other conditions set forth in the definitive merger agreement, this transaction is anticipated to close in the second quarter of 2018.\nImportant Information for Investors and Shareholders:\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities of LCNB.
