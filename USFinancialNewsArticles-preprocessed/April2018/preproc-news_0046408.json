    "text": "BARCELONA (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Entrepreneur Josep Esteba became so frustrated trying to get around his native Spain in a wheelchair for more than 20 years that he embarked on a mission to map cities for disabled people all over the world.\nJosep Esteba, founder and CEO of Spanish mobile app Mapp4all, presents at the Alliance for Universal Accessibility Day held in Barcelona, Spain, on June 15, 2017. HANDOUT/Mapp4all “Many years ago I traveled a lot for work, and would arrive in cities that I didn’t know very well,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “That’s when I realized that there just wasn’t information for those that needed it.”\nFast-forward several years and Esteba, a paraplegic since a car accident in his early twenties, set out on another journey – this time a virtual one to digitalize information on accessibility.\nThe 50-year-old, who founded the free mobile application Mapp4all in 2015, said such data had simply not existed in Spain.\nThe Barcelona-based app allows wheelchair users, as well as the blind, hearing-impaired and others, to find out how accessible a building is before they visit it.\nUsers can check whether a cinema or museum has ramps or lift access, for instance, or if a restaurant provides menus in Braille.\nEstablishments can register to add information themselves, but the app also draws on data that is self-reported by users. It has been downloaded in nearly 3,000 cities and works across nine languages.\nMapp4all is one of a slew of apps that have been developed in recent years to help disabled people navigate cities.\nBlindSquare and Wayfindr both offer audio instructions to help blind people get around cities globally, while the Wheely NYC app helps New Yorkers use the subway by providing targeted information, like whether lifts are working.\nLESS OPPORTUNITY More than 1 billion people in the world have a disability, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\nBy 2050, of the roughly 6.25 billion people who will be living in urban areas, 15 percent are expected to have disabilities, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs has predicted.\nPeople with disabilities tend to have fewer economic opportunities and lower educational achievements than their able-bodied peers, due to a lack of tailored services and the obstacles they face in everyday life, according to the WHO.\nBuildings without lifts, shops that have no step-free access and inaccessible toilets are just some of the challenges disabled people face in getting around urban areas.\nIn general, disabled people still do not expect places to be fully accessible, and there is a long way to go in quelling that anxiety, said Ross Atkin, a UK-based designer specializing in accessibility.\n“When it’s somewhere they don’t know, they’re not sure there will be the drop curbs they need ... they’re not sure they’re going to be able to get off the bus,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n“You only need a couple of experiences of going somewhere and getting stuck to lose your independent mobility,” he added.\nBeing better informed allows people to move out of their comfort zone, instead of going back to the same places they already know they can access, said Esteba.\nPersonal experience has taught him that accessibility data must be broad enough to cater for every type of user.\n“I’m in a wheelchair, but what is accessible for me is not the same as for someone who is 30 years older or weighs 30 kilos more,” he said.\nThe Mapp4all app is used to display accessibility information on a Madrid museum, pictured in Barcelona, Spain, on April 18, 2018. Thomson Reuters Foundation/Sophie Davies VARYING NEEDS Managing varied needs - even among those with a similar disability - is a challenge in making cities more navigable, said Atkin.\nWheelchair users tend to report the same kinds of requirements, like unobstructed footways. But with sight loss, the problems are less obvious, and people’s requirements differ significantly, he said.\nAnd solutions that work for someone with sight loss might be an obstruction for another person, he added.\nApps are helpful - but only if the information they provide is reliable, Atkin noted.\n“If the app says there is going to be a drop curb and then there isn’t... you’re probably not going to trust the app again,” he said.\nSilvia Guerrero, who has tried accessibility apps in Spain, said she found the data was often wrong or false when reported by the establishments themselves.\n“This happened to me in a bank which said it was accessible, but at the entrance there was an insurmountable step for people in wheelchairs,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “I’ve come across this in several places.”\nNEW DATA SOLUTIONS Experts say issues with data reliability, and friction between the needs of disabled users can be alleviated by new approaches to digital technology, such as a project known as Accessible Routes from Crowdsourced Cloud Services (ARCCS).\nLed by University College London (UCL), it uses low-cost sensor devices on wheelchairs, linked to a mobile phone, to anonymously measure and collect data on how the chairs are used.\nIt removes the need to add a physical object to the environment that could get in someone’s way, or to rely on self-reported information, said Catherine Holloway, a lecturer in assistive technology and accessibility at the UCL Interaction Centre.\nWithin several years, it could provide a very large dataset for authorities to ascertain how accessible cities are and what works for disabled people in a more tailored way, she said.\nThe project, which has been piloted in India, provides much more dynamic data, and is economical as an existing Wi-Fi network in a bus or metro can be used to transmit the data, she said.\nThe sensors were tested in Delhi last year under a program called Street Rehab, in collaboration with local non-governmental organizations.\nResearchers found disabled people in India’s capital had not been trained to use their wheelchair or tricycle, construction works often made roads impassable for them, and inaccessible infrastructure was a major barrier to them going to work.\n“In the developing world, it really helps if there is already legislation in place to make infrastructure accessible – before it is built – so it doesn’t have to be retrofitted after construction, which is much more expensive,” Holloway said.\nAround 80 percent of people with disabilities live in developing nations, according to the United Nations Development Programme.\nExperts say the poor are at higher risk of acquiring a disability due to lack of access to healthcare, sanitation and safe working conditions.\nCloud-based technology is also being developed by Irish start-up Pavanu Mobility, which develops robotic devices linked to mobile applications to spot potential accessibility hazards, and assess their seriousness.\nReporting by Sophie Davies; editing by Megan Rowling.
