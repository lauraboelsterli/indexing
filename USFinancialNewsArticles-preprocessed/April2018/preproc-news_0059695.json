    "text": "HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Comfort Systems USA, Inc. (NYSE: FIX), a leading provider of mechanical services including heating, ventilation, air conditioning, plumbing, piping and controls, today announced net income of $16.7 million or $0.44 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $7.5 million or $0.20 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The Company reported revenue of $464.9 million in the current quarter, as compared to $380.6 million in 2017.\nBrian Lane, Comfort Systems USA’s President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We are very pleased to report strong first quarter increases in earnings and revenue, both on an absolute and same-store basis. Our quarterly earnings per share increased by $0.07 per diluted share due to a discrete tax item. Even without that discrete tax benefit, we are reporting a significant increase in first quarter profitability.”\nThe Company reported negative free cash flow of $1.4 million in the current quarter, as compared to positive free cash flow of $5.3 million in 2017. Backlog as of March 31, 2018 was $1.08 billion as compared to $948.4 million as of December 31, 2017 and $863.0 million as of March 31, 2017.\nMr. Lane continued, “Our backlog continues to build, with strong new construction activity in many of our most profitable markets. This quarter marks the first time that our backlog has exceeded $1.0 billion. Service profitability improved compared to a year ago, and cash flow is very good for a first quarter, especially in light of our revenue growth.”\nMr. Lane concluded, “We remain optimistic about underlying trends, including for the remainder of this year, and we continue to be deeply grateful to our fantastic team members who are executing at a high level across the United States.”\nAs previously announced, the Company will host a webcast and conference call to discuss its financial results and position in more depth on Friday, April 27, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Central Time.

The words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “intend,” “foresee,” “should,” “would,” “could,” or other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, which are generally not historic in nature. These forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Comfort Systems USA, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) concerning future developments and their effect on the Company. While the Company’s management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made, there can be no assurance that future developments affecting the Company will be those that it anticipates. All comments concerning the Company’s expectations for future revenue and operating results are based on the Company’s forecasts for its existing operations and do not include the potential impact of any future acquisitions. The Company’s forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties (some of which are beyond the Company’s control) and assumptions that could cause actual future results to differ materially from the Company’s historical experience and its present expectations or projections. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the use of incorrect estimates for bidding a fixed-price contract; undertaking contractual commitments that exceed the Company’s labor resources; failing to perform contractual obligations efficiently enough to maintain profitability; national or regional weakness in construction activity and economic conditions; financial difficulties affecting projects, vendors, customers, or subcontractors; the Company’s backlog failing to translate into actual revenue or profits; failure of third party subcontractors and suppliers to complete work as anticipated; difficulty in obtaining or increased costs associated with bonding and insurance; impairment to goodwill; errors in the Company’s percentage-of-completion method of accounting; the result of competition in the Company’s markets; the Company’s decentralized management structure; material failure to comply with varying state and local laws, regulations or requirements; debarment from bidding on or performing government contracts; shortages of labor and specialty building materials; retention of key management; seasonal fluctuations in the demand for mechanical systems; the imposition of past and future liability from environmental, safety, and health regulations including the inherent risk associated with self-insurance; adverse litigation results; an increase in our effective tax rate; an information technology failure or cyber security breach; and other risks detailed in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nFor additional information regarding known material factors that could cause the Company’s results to differ from its projected results, please see its filings with the SEC, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K.\nReaders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\n— Financial tables follow —\nComfort Systems USA, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n(In Thousands, Except per Share Amounts)\nThree Months Ended March 31, (Unaudited) 2018 % 2017 %\nRevenue $ 464,941 100.0 % $ 380,588 100.0 % Cost of services 375,888 80.8 % 304,634 80.0 % Gross profit 89,053 19.2 % 75,954 20.0 % SG&A 70,023 15.1 % 63,247 16.6 % Goodwill impairment — — 1,105 0.3 % Gain on sale of assets (211 ) — (154 ) —\nOperating income 19,241 4.1 % 11,756 3.1 % Interest expense, net (699 ) (0.2 ) % (379 ) (0.1 ) % Changes in the fair value of contingent earn-out obligations 153 — (26 ) — Other income (expense) 38 — 18 — Income before income taxes 18,733 4.0 % 11,369 3.0 % Provision for income taxes 2,074 3,892 Net income $ 16,659 3.6 % $ 7,477 2.0 % Income per share Basic $ 0.45 $ 0.20 Diluted $ 0.44 $ 0.20 Shares used in computing income per share: Basic 37,192 37,225 Diluted 37,628 37,724 Supplemental Non-GAAP Information — Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) — (Unaudited) (In Thousands)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 % 2017 % Net income $ 16,659 $ 7,477 Provision for income taxes 2,074 3,892 Other expense (income), net (38) (18) Changes in the fair value of contingent earn-out obligations (153) 26 Interest expense, net 699 379 Gain on sale of assets (211) (154) Goodwill impairment — 1,105 Depreciation and amortization 9,240 6,139 Adjusted EBITDA $ 28,270 6.1 % $ 18,846 5.0 % Note: The Company defines adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) as net income, provision for income taxes, other expense (income), net, changes in the fair value of contingent earn-out obligations, interest expense, net, gain on sale of assets, goodwill impairment and depreciation and amortization. Other companies may define Adjusted EBITDA differently. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because it is a financial measure that is frequently requested by third parties. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not considered under generally accepted accounting principles as a primary measure of an entity’s financial results, and accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to operating income, net income, or cash flows as determined under generally accepted accounting principles and as reported by the Company.\nComfort Systems USA, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(In Thousands)\nMarch 31, December 31, 2018 2017 (Unaudited) Cash and cash equivalents $ 25,219 $ 36,542 Billed accounts receivable, net 392,998 382,867 Unbilled accounts receivable 36,634 — Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings 2,093 30,116 Other current assets 34,849 39,832 Total current assets 491,793 489,357 Property and equipment, net 88,298 87,591 Goodwill 203,199 200,584 Identifiable intangible assets, net 78,332 76,044 Other noncurrent assets 21,096 27,544 Total assets $ 882,718 $ 881,120 Current maturities of long-term debt $ 1,113 $ 613 Accounts payable 128,249 132,011 Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings 107,939 106,005 Other current liabilities 128,735 135,099 Total current liabilities 366,036 373,728 Long-term debt 64,880 59,926 Other long-term liabilities 22,664 29,521 Total liabilities 453,580 463,175 Total stockholders’ equity 429,138 417,945 Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 882,718 $ 881,120 Selected Cash Flow Data (Unaudited) (In Thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,851 $ 10,053 Investing activities $ (11,941 ) $ (5,098 ) Financing activities $ (3,233 ) $ (5,585 ) Free cash flow: Cash from operating activities $ 3,851 $ 10,053 Purchases of property and equipment (5,588 ) (5,077 ) Proceeds from sales of property and equipment 366 292 Free cash flow $ (1,371 ) $ 5,268 Note: Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities less customary capital expenditures, plus the proceeds from asset sales.
