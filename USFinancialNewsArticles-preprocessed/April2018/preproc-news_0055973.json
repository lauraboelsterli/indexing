    "text": "Beverly Hills, Calif., April 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MC Endeavors, Inc. ( MSMY ), an innovator in social commerce platforms, is committed to becoming a leading global social commerce company that utilizes a single core platform, Room 21™, to produce, distribute and monetize online communities for individuals and businesses that interact with industries ranging from industrial business to entertainment and healthcare.\nManagement is proud to make the following announcements in its Healthcare Division:\nThe company has completed negotiations and is proud to announce that the new Room 21 Media studio is located in 23022 La Cadena, Laguna Hills, 92653. The facility is fully operational with HD cameras, lighting, sound, and editing bays. This is a fully functioning studio. The completion of this agreement has the TheShare.TV ahead of schedule and achieves increased profitability by a minimum of 327% by having its own production facility versus renting and purchasing new equipment. The company has named Elisa Edwards as Director of Account Management, Advertising Division. She combines two critical work experiences in which she has represented addiction and mental health treatment centers in outreach, promotions, and has networked with the top professionals in the industry. Additionally, Ms. Edwards worked with Warner Bros. in the Music/Legal Department, clearing music for feature films. This combined work experience makes Ms. Edwards a unique contribution to the The Share.TV advertising and programming team. Launched TheShare.TV Foundation for Addiction Recovery to become a national 501(c)3 Non-Profit that provides addiction treatment and long term recovery solutions. The purpose of this foundation is to collaborate specifically with The Share.TV and Room 21 Media to garner federal and state funding for its outreach initiatives. We believe that The Share.TV Foundation can possibly raise millions of dollars in funding for programs distributed through The Share.TV Network channel. Our wholly owned subsidiary, The Share.TV, LLC continues merger discussions and our management team has finalized two possible candidates for merger into publicly held entities. Management expects to finalize terms before the end of May.\nJohn Stippick, CEO, stated “We are tremendously excited about the new Room 21 Media Studio and the significant progress with The Share TV™ Network. I am proud of the team and am proud of the value that we have developed for our shareholders. I am personally excited, our team is excited, and we’ve received many emails from shareholders expressing their excitement too. We all know that MC Endeavors/Room 21 Media is the one company uniquely positioned to provide its technology platforms and video production capabilities while developing an enterprise to serve our country. As a complete television network with a full lineup of original programming, we expect revenues in excess of 10 million dollars for this year through The Share.TV network beginning in 3rd and 4th Quarter of 2018.”\n“Our shareholders can also expect ongoing updates via social media so we encourage all shareholders to follow our social media accounts on Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram to always receive the latest updates on our progress. We are a media company and as such will be making announcements of our progress. We believe in transparency, continuous progress updates, and we encourage our shareholder to be in communication with our team.” said Mr. Stippick.\nFor further information contact:\nJohn Stippick\nPresident\nMC Endeavors, Inc/Room 21 Media\nPhone: (310) 986-6373\nE-mail: johns@room21media.com\nSafe Harbor Statement - In addition to historical information, this press release may contain statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
