    "text": "CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt said on Saturday it was deeply concerned over a military escalation in Syria which could affect the safety of Syrian people and threaten agreements to curb tension.\nU.S., British and French forces struck Syria with more than 100 missiles on Saturday, targeting what they called chemical weapons sites in retaliation for a poison gas attack.\nThe White House has accused Syria of being behind the toxic gas assault on April 7 that killed dozens of people in Douma, near Damascus.\nWithout specifically mentioning Saturday’s missile strikes, Egypt’s foreign ministry said it was deeply concerned “at the current military escalation in Syria”. It also rejected the use of internationally banned weapons on Syrian territory and demanded a transparent international investigation.\n“The Arab Republic of Egypt expresses its solidarity with the brotherly Syrian people in their aspirations to live in security and stability,” the ministry said in a statement.\nIt called for a peaceful resolution to the Syrian crisis and efforts to ensure humanitarian aid reaches those affected by the conflict.\nReporting by Arwa Gaballa; Editing by Dominic Evans\n ",
