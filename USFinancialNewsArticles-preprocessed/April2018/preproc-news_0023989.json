    "text": "April 10, 2018 / 12:32 PM / Updated 38 minutes ago UPDATE 1-Ireland raises 4 billion euros in syndicated bond sale Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Adds total funds raised this year) \nDUBLIN, April 10 (Reuters) - Ireland raised 4 billion euros in a syndicated 15-year bond issue on Tuesday, the national debt agency said. \nThe issue attracted 12.5 billion euros of investor orders at a price of 4 basis points over mid-swaps, the National Treasury Management Agency said. \nThe pricing represents a yield of less than 1.4 percent according to a market source. \nThe syndicated issue is the second this year, after the debt agency raised 4 billion euros ($4.92 billion) in 10-year debt in January. On that occasion, the bonds yielded 0.944 percent. \nIreland also raised 2.25 billion euros through two bond auctions. \nThe syndicated issue brings the total raised so far this year to 10.25 billion euros out of a planned 14 billion to 18 billion euros issuance of long-term debt this year.
