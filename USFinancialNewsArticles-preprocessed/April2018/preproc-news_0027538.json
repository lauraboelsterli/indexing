    "text": "Sidney Crosby scored one goal and added three assists as the Pittsburgh Penguins defeated the Philadelphia Flyers 5-1 Sunday at the Wells Fargo Center.\nJustin Schultz, Derek Brassard, Evgeni Malkin and Brian Dumoulin also scored for the Penguins, who took a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference playoff series.\nKris Letang also had two assists for the Penguins and goaltender Matt Murray was terrific with 26 saves.\nMalkin recorded his 100th career playoff assist on Schultz’s goal.\nThe Flyers couldn’t capitalize on their momentum gained in Game Two as goaltender Brian Elliott struggled with 21 saves on 26 shots.\nTravis Sanheim scored for the Flyers.\nPittsburgh sealed the victory with a power-play goal by Schultz for a commanding 5-1 lead at 7:08 of the third period. The power play was set up after a high sticking penalty called on Philadelphia’s Jake Voracek.\nThe Penguins dominated the early part of the second with three goals to go ahead 4-0.\nBrassard made it 2-0 at 2:48 on the power play.\nThen the Penguins struck for two goals in five seconds. Malkin’s blast on a 4-on-3 power play gave them a 3-0 advantage on his 60th career playoff goal.\nFive seconds later, Dumoulin received a pass from Crosby and scored for a 4-0 lead at 6:53.\nSanheim got the Flyers on the board with his first career playoff goal to get within 4-1 at 13:42.\nPhiladelphia was hurt by its poor power play, going 0 for 4 through the first two periods.\nThe Flyers had a couple of good early chances as Sanheim had a shot saved by the right pad of Murray with 17:52 left in the first.\nPittsburgh struck first as Crosby scored on a beautiful wraparound at 10:25. It was Crosby’s fourth goal of the series following a hat trick in Game One.\nValtteri Filppula nearly equalized for the Flyers with 1:44 remaining but Murray stymied the opportunity with a great save.\nMurray was terrific in the first as he stopped all 11 Philadelphia shots.\n— Field Level Media\n ",
