    "text": "\nLike Delta, United (ual) stopped providing discounted travel in February. United is notifying the NRA that we will no longer offer a discounted rate to their annual meeting and we are asking that the NRA remove our information from their website. \n— United Airlines (@united) February 24, 2018 MetLife \nThe insurance giant (met) in February ended its discount program for NRA members, raising costs on insurance for boats, motorcycles and RVs. We value all our customers but have decided to end our discount program with the NRA. First National Bank \nThe financial institution opted to stop offering an NRA Visa card. Customer feedback has caused us to review our relationship with the NRA. As a result, First National Bank of Omaha will not renew its contract with the National Rifle Association to issue the NRA Visa Card. \n— First National Bank (@FNBOmaha) February 22, 2018 Enterprise Rent A Car \nAs of last month, the rental car agency let its corporate relationship with the NRA expire, meaning member discounts ended. Thanks for contacting us. We ended the program – effective March 26. https://t.co/tRdHdoevfT Hertz \nNRA members won’t find a discount on car rentals here, either. We have notified the NRA that we are ending the NRA’s rental car discount program with Hertz. \n— Hertz (@Hertz) February 23, 2018 Budget Car Rental \nMarch 26 was the last day of this car rental company offered NRA discounts. The program has been discontinued. Thanks for reaching out. Effective March 26, we will no longer provide the NRA member discount. ~Sam \n— Budget Car Rental (@Budget) February 24, 2018 Allied and North American Van Lines \nBoth moving companies have ended their discount programs. Allied Van Lines no longer has an affiliate relationship with the NRA effective immediately. We have asked them to remove our listing from their benefits site. \n— Allied Van Lines (@alliedvl) February 23, 2018 northAmerican Van Lines no longer has an affiliate relationship with the NRA effective immediately. We have asked them to remove our listing from their benefits site. \n— North American VL (@northAmericanVL) February 23, 2018 Symantic \nThe company (symc) behind Norton Antivirus no longer offers discounts to NRA members. Symantec has stopped its discount program with the National Rifle Association. \n— Symantec (@symantec) February 23, 2018 Wyndham Hotels \nThe hotel chain (wyn) made it clear in February it had cut ties with the NRA, but didn’t say when that had occurred. @iainjgrant Please know, Wyndham is no longer affiliated with the NRA. \n— Wyndham Worldwide (@Wyndham) February 24, 2018 Best Western \nNRA members will find no discounts at this national chain either, but that has been the case since 2014. Best Western Hotels & Resorts does not have any affiliation with and is not a corporate partner of the National Rifle Association (NRA). Best Western ended any association with the NRA in 2014. \n— Best Western (@BestWestern) February 25, 2018 Paramount Rx \nNRA members used to get a prescription discount program via this benefits management company. Thank you all for your feedback. \nParamount Rx issued the statement below.“The prescription discount program that is made available to NRA members is offered through a third-party vendor. We are working with that vendor to discontinue the program and remove the offering.” \n— Paramount Rx (@ParamountRx) February 24, 2018 \nThe shutdown of that program began in February.
