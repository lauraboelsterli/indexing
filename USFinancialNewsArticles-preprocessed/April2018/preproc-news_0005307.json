    "text": "Atlanta-based digitally-led creative shop AMMUNITIONagency continues buildout of senior leadership\nATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AMMUNITIONagency has officially hired Whitney Pillsbury, who most recently served as Executive Creative Director at Publicis NY and oversaw creative development and execution on core clients, as Chief Creative Officer. The long list of accounts Pillsbury touched during his tenure includes Wendy’s, Pfizer, Nestle, P&G, USBank, and Abbott. On the latter, he created the Similac “Sisterhood of Motherhood” campaign which made YouTube’s top 10, won PR campaign of the year, 2 Clios, and the 2016 Gold Effie as one of the most effective marketing efforts of the year.\nThis press release features multimedia.

I’ve experienced this sort of environment first-hand, when starting the Kaplan Thaler Group over 18 years ago,” said Pillsbury. “I can’t wait to dive into the competitive markets they play in. I’m looking forward to pushing the creative product, drawing upon the agency’s unrivaled digital expertise. It’s an exciting time in Atlanta and I’m honored to be a part of this talented team. I know we will do great things together.”\nPillsbury’s experience includes rebooting Abbott’s other marquee brands: Ensure, PediaSure & Glucerna, where he built a network of agencies and supervised their creative standards and execution.\n“When I was leading the PediaSure brand at Abbott, we worked with Whitney to help reinvent our brand,” said Brent Guinn, now AMMUNITIONagency’s Chief Strategy Officer. “Whitney had an enormous impact on our brand and our efforts to grow the business. My AMMUNITIONagency colleagues and I are eager to help him apply his creativity to support our clients.”\nPillsbury also created the memorable and moving “Imagine a world without hate” social campaign for the Anti-Defamation League. With no paid media, it went global with 100 million impressions in 10 days. It was the first nonprofit featured on YouTube’s Top 10 Leaderboard, won best of show at the ADDYS, and was screened in the last oval office.\nHe led the winning pitch for the Wendy’s account, the largest new business win in the industry that year. Mr. Pillsbury’s responsibilities included overseeing creative output from traditional to digital, while leading partner agencies in development and execution. The hard work paid off: Wendy’s surpassed Burger King in sales for the first time ever.\nPillsbury started his career at McCann-Erickson NY and J. Walter Thompson after graduating from the University of Texas advertising program. At AMMUNITIONagency, he’ll lead creative for brands like Mitsubishi Electric, Mimaki, TokenTax, and Make-A-Wish Georgia.\nJeremy Heilpern, President and CEO of AMMUNITIONagency, said, “Whitney’s vast experience leading creative teams at the highest level, the award-winning work he’s done for some of the world’s biggest brands, and his involvement building what eventually became Publicis NY, makes him a tremendous addition to the team and an asset to our growth going forward.”\nLinda Kaplan Thaler, Advertising Hall of Famer and former chairman of Publicis Kaplan Thaler, said of Pillsbury: “I am incredibly grateful for all Whitney did for our agency, our clients, and our staff over the 18 years we worked together. Among many things, he left a legacy of one of the best workplace culture’s in the industry.”\nAbout AMMUNITIONagency\nAMMUNITIONagency is a digitally-led creative agency, bringing together creatives, technologists, strategists and consultants to create experiences that transform brands, grow businesses, and create more meaningful relationships between brands and their customers.
