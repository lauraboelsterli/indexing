    "text": "BUDAPEST, April 8 (Reuters) - Hungary’s ruling Fidesz party has put in a strong showing at Sunday’s parliamentary election, the government’s news blog said in a post quoting Fidesz lawmaker Szilard Nemeth.\n“Just before sealing the last ballot box and without knowing the results of the election, Fidesz Vice President Szilard Nemeth said he’s sure that a sizeable majority has voted for the governing parties,” said a post published at 2011 GMT.\nThe first preliminary results are expected around 2100 GMT, the National Election Office said earlier.
