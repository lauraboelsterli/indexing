    "text": "/ uganda Xi Jinping speech, US-China trade tensions and stocks in focus \nTrade tensions between the world’s two largest economies have been in focus in recent weeks, with investors on edge over the possibility of a trade war happening. \nChinese President Xi Jinping’s scheduled speech at the Boao Forum for Asia will be closely watched for Beijing’s response to the recent escalation in U.S.-China trade tensions . Investors will also be on the lookout for potential announcements on market reforms . \n“Expectations are reasonably high that China’s president will reaffirm Beijing’s ongoing commitment to reform and more open markets (while not being seen to overtly acquiesce to Washington’s demands,)” said ANZ analysts in a note. \nXi’s speech came on the back of President Donald Trump’s announcement on Friday that he had instructed U.S. trade officials to consider an additional $100 billion in tariffs on Chinese imports. \nThat followed China’s Wednesday announcement that it would introduce extra tariffs on 106 U.S. products, including soybeans, although no start date was given. \nTrump said in a tweet on Sunday that he expected China would remove its trade barriers, adding that the U.S. and China had a “[g]reat future” ahead. On Monday, however, the president criticized China in a separate tweet for what he called “STUPID TRADE.” \nU.S. stock indexes rose on Monday, but finished the day well off session highs following a report that FBI officers had raided the office of Michael Cohen, Trump’s longtime personal lawyer. \nStocks had rallied earlier in the session after recent U.S.- China trade tensions appeared to ease following a week largely dominated by trade-related developments. \nAgainst the yen , the dollar was steady at 106.80 by 9:25 a.m. HK/SIN although that was still below levels above the 107 handle seen during Monday Asia trade. Meanwhile, the dollar index was relatively flat at 89.817. ADVERTISEMENT",
