    "text": "April 6, 2018 / 9:49 AM / Updated 7 minutes ago ABB to invest 100 million euros in industrial automation campus in Austria   \nLINZ, Austria (Reuters) - Swiss engineering group ABB ( ABBN.S ) will invest 100 million euros (87.06 million pounds) in an innovation and training campus in Austria to develop technologies for its industrial automation unit, it said on Friday. Chairman Peter Voser of Swiss power technology and automation group ABB addresses the company's annual shareholder meeting in Zurich, Switzerland, March 29, 2018. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann \nA year ago, ABB bought Austrian industrial automation specialist Bernecker & Rainer (BR), which makes programmable controls for machines, to better challenge German rival Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ) on the factory floor. \nNow it plans to create around 1,000 new jobs at a new campus at the B&R headquarters in Eggelsberg in the province of Upper Austria, ABB said. \nThe campus is expected to be finished by 2020. \nABB said a year ago it aimed to increase B&R’s annual sales to above $1 billion from around $600 million. \n“We are well on track to achieve this goal,” Chief Executive Ulrich Spiesshofer said in a statement. \nThe Austrian acquisition helped ABB consolidate its No. 2 position in the $130 billion processing and industrial sector behind Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ) but ahead of rivals such as Emerson ( EMR.N ), Rockwell Automation and General Electric ( GE.N ).
