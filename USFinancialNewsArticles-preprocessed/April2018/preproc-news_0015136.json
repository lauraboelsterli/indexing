The next day, Longfin CEO Meenavalli stated that the company would file its 10-K within three days; however, no such filing was made by then or during trading on April 2, 2018.\nOn this event, the price of Longfin's shares plummeted.\nAbout Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC\nKSF, whose partners include former Louisiana Attorney General Charles C.
