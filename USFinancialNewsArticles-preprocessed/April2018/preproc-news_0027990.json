    "text": "April 17 (Reuters) - Australiaâ€™s Oil Search reported a 14.2-percent fall in first-quarter revenue on Tuesday as output from its key Papua New Guinea liquefied natural gas (PNG LNG) project fell after a powerful quake hit the region in February.\nRevenue for the three months ended March 31 slipped to $295 million from $343.7 million at the same time last year. Production fell to 4.84 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe), compared with 7.57 mmboe a year ago.\nOil Search cut its full-year production forecast to 23-26 mmboe from an earlier estimate of 28.5- 30.5 mmboe.
