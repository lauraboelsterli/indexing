FILE PHOTO: Cho Hyun-min, a senior vice president at Korean Air Lines and a daughter of its chairman Cho Yang-ho, arrives at Incheon International Airport in Incheon, South Korea, in this still image from MBC exclusive news report footage obtained by Yonhap on April 15, 2018. MBC footage/Yonhap via REUTERS \nOne of the daughters, Cho Hyun-min, a senior vice-president at the airline, is under investigation by police for suspected assault for allegedly throwing water at an attendee of a business meeting. \nHer older sister, Heather Cho, made global headlines in 2014 when she ordered a Korean Air plane to return to its gate at a New York airport because she was angry over the way she had been served nuts in first class. She was jailed and returned to work as an executive of Korean Air’s hotel affiliate in March. Slideshow (2 Images) \nChairman Cho said the company would “turn over a new leaf” with stronger management led by its board. \n“As chairman of Korean Air as well as a father, I am terribly sorry for my daughter’s misstep. Everything is my responsibility and fault,” he said in a statement. Reporting by Heekyong Yang and Ju-min Park; Editing by Stephen Coates",
