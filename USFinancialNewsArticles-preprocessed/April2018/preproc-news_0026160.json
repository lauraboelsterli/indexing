    "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s Software AG ( SOWGn.DE ) has raised its outlook for sales from industrial internet business after the division’s sales doubled in the first quarter.\nThe company, based near Frankfurt, said late on Friday it expects sales of its IoT/Cloud (Internet of Things) business to grow between 100 and 135 percent this year, compared with a previous guidance for 70-to-100 percent growth.\nThat would indicate sales of between 30 and 35 million euros ($36.99-43.15 million), compared with a previous forecast for 25-30 million, it said.\nGermany’s No. 2 business software maker in January split out IoT as a separate division.\nFirst-quarter sales from IoT jumped 125 percent from year-earlier figures to 6.4 million euros, the firm said.\nReporting by Andreas Cremer; Editing by Clelia Oziel\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
