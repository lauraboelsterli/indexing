    "text": "Yahoo Japan Corp said on Friday it would buy a minority stake in a Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange, becoming the latest major Japanese financial services provider to shrug off security concerns and join the digital money industry.\nYahoo Japan, which is also the country's biggest online auction site, said in a statement it would buy through a subsidiary a 40 percent stake in BitARG Exchange Tokyo, with services planned for launch in the autumn.\nYahoo Japan did not give details of the value of the investment. But a person familiar with the matter said it would likely total 2 billion to 3 billion yen ($18.6 million to $27.9 million).\nShares in Yahoo Japan closed down 0.2 percent, against a 0.6 gain for the benchmark Nikkei average .\nThe deal comes after Japanese online brokerage firm Monex Group Inc (8698.T) said last week it would buy hacked cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck Inc for $34 million.\nThat saw Monex join other mainstream financial services providers such as larger peer SBI Holdings Inc and messaging app operator Line Corp in looking to enter the cryptocurrency industry.",
