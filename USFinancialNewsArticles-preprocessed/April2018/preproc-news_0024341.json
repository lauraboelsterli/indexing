(the “Company”) (NYSE:ORC) announced today that the Board of Directors declared a monthly cash dividend for the month of April 2018. The dividend of $0.09 per share will be paid May 10, 2018 to holders of record on April 30, 2018, with an ex-dividend date of April 27, 2018.\nThe Company intends to make regular monthly cash distributions to its stockholders. In order to qualify as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”), the Company must distribute annually to its stockholders an amount at least equal to 90% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain. The Company will be subject to income tax on taxable income that is not distributed and to an excise tax to the extent that a certain percentage of its taxable income is not distributed by specified dates. The Company has not established a minimum distribution payment level and is not assured of its ability to make distributions to stockholders in the future.\nAs of April 12, 2018, the Company had 53,098,115 shares outstanding. At December 31, 2017, the Company had 53,061,904 shares outstanding.\nEstimated March 31, 2018 Book Value Per Share\nThe Company’s estimated book value per share as of March 31, 2018 was $8.09. The Company computes book value per share by dividing total stockholders' equity by the total number of outstanding shares of common stock. At March 31, 2018, the Company's preliminary estimated total stockholders' equity was approximately $429.5 million with 53,072,169 shares of common stock outstanding. These figures and the resulting estimated book value per share are preliminary, subject to change, and subject to review by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm.\nEstimated Net Income Per Share and Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses on RMBS and Derivative Instruments\nThe Company estimates it generated a net loss per share of $0.31, which includes $0.72 per share of net realized and unrealized losses on RMBS and derivative instruments for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. These amounts compare to total dividends declared during the quarter of $0.31 per share. Net income per common share calculated under generally accepted accounting principles can, and does, differ from our REIT taxable income. The Company views REIT taxable income as a better indication of income to be paid in the form of a dividend rather than net income. Many components of REIT taxable income can only be estimated at this time and our monthly dividends declared are based on both estimates of REIT taxable income to be earned over the course of the current quarter and calendar year and a longer-term estimate of the REIT taxable income of the Company. These figures are preliminary, subject to change, and subject to review by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm.\nEstimated Return on Equity\nThe Company’s estimated total return on equity for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was (3.6)%, or (14.2)% on an annualized basis. The Company calculates total return on equity as the sum of dividends declared and paid during the quarter plus changes in book value during the quarter, divided by the Company’s stockholders’ equity at the beginning of the quarter. The total return was $(0.31) per share, comprised of dividends per share of $0.31 and a decrease in book value per share of $0.62 from December 31, 2017.\nRMBS Portfolio Characteristics\nDetails of the RMBS portfolio as of March 31, 2018 are presented below. These figures are preliminary and subject to change and, with respect to figures that will appear in the Company’s financial statements and associated footnotes as of and for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, are subject to review by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm.\nRMBS Valuation Characteristics RMBS Assets by Agency Investment Company Act of 1940 Whole Pool Test Results Repurchase Agreement Exposure by Counterparty RMBS Risk Measures\nAbout Orchid Island Capital, Inc.\nOrchid Island Capital, Inc. is a specialty finance company that invests in Agency RMBS that are either traditional pass-through Agency RMBS or structured Agency RMBS.
