    "text": "Buoyed by a huge first quarter and rookie Malik Monk, the Charlotte Hornets hammered the host Orlando Magic in a 137-100 romp Friday night at the Amway Center in Orlando, Fla.\nMonk scored a career-high 26 points off the bench and reserve Frank Kaminsky poured in 21 points as Charlotte snapped a four-game losing streak.\nMarvin Williams tallied 18 points, Jeremy Lamb poured in 16 points, Dwight Howard supplied 16 points and 17 rebounds, Kemba Walker had 13 points and Willy Hernangomez notched 11 points and 12 rebounds as the Hornets outscored Orlando in each quarter.\nThe Hornets led 43-25 after the first quarter, marking a franchise record for first-quarter points in a road game.\nThe margin grew to 72-49 at halftime. Charlotte made eight 3-point baskets in the first half, with six of those coming from reserves.\nMonk, a guard out of Kentucky, became the first NBA rookie to hit at least four 3-point shots in three consecutive games off the bench. He also delivered a team-leading eight assists.\nMonk continued a strong late-season stretch. He has scored at least 16 points in four consecutive games, including 21 earlier in the week at Chicago.\nMonk, who was 8-for-14 from the field, and Lamb both made four 3-pointers. The Hornets were 17-for-31 on 3-pointers in the game.\nReserves accounted for 77 Charlotte points, producing more than half of the team’s offense.\nD.J. Augustin led the Magic with 19 points and Marreese Speights posted 14 points. Jamel Artis, Khem Birch and Rodney Purvis all had 12 points, while Mario Hezonja tallied 11 points and Wesley Iwundu had 10 points.\nOrlando had its first two-game winning streak in more than a month come to a halt. The Magic shot 44.7 percent (42-for-94) from the field. That included a combined 7-for-20 from starting frontcourt players Hezonja and Bismark Biyombo.\nThe Hornets won for only the 14th time in 40 road games. Orlando slipped to 16-24 at home.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
