I know first hand from my years visiting with Connacht and Glasgow the passion and fervour that makes playing in front of Ulster fans so special,\" McFarland told Ulster's website www.ulsterrugby.com .\n“It’s a club with a great history and I welcome the challenge of being a part of their future.”\nScottish Rugby said in a statement that Worcester Warriors head coach Carl Hogg has joined the national side’s coaching staff on an interim basis.\nHogg and McFarland will work together as forward coaches during Scotland’s 2018 tour of Canada, U.S. and Argentina.\nUlster have had an inconsistent season where they were knocked out of the Champions Cup in January and are currently fourth in Pro 14 Conference B.
