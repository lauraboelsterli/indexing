    "text": "JOHNS CREEK, Ga., April 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Saia, Inc. (NASDAQ:SAIA), a leading transportation provider offering multi-regional less-than-truckload (LTL), non-asset truckload, expedited and logistics services, today reported first quarter 2018 financial results. Diluted earnings per share were $0.80 for the first quarter and include a $0.03 per share positive impact from alternative fuel tax credits for the full year 2017, enacted in the first quarter of this year. The Company earned $0.44 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Compared to First Quarter 2017 Results\nRevenues were $393 million, a 22% increase LTL Shipments and Tonnage rose 8.4% and 12.2%, respectively LTL Revenue per hundredweight increased 7.7% Operating ratio improved by 160 basis points to 93.0% Operating income rose 57% to a record $27.6 million Net income benefitted from a lower effective income tax rate as well as the aforementioned fuel tax credit, and rose 85% to $21.1 million\n“I am pleased that we were able to translate the strong shipment and tonnage growth in the quarter into improved operating results,” said Saia President and Chief Executive Officer, Rick O’Dell. “During the quarter we opened two new terminals and put hundreds of new tractors and trailers into service across our network, while maintaining high quality service for our customers. The rate environment remains constructive and our contractual renewals in the quarter saw an average increase of 7.6%,” O’Dell continued.\n“We have now opened a total of eight new terminals in the past year. All but one are in markets where we previously had not offered direct service. Our customers are embracing the better geographic coverage as we continue to extend Saia’s service capabilities,” concluded Mr. O’Dell.\nFinancial Position and Capital Expenditures\nTotal debt was $142.6 million at March 31, 2018 and inclusive of the cash on-hand, net debt to total capital was 19.0%. This compares to total debt of $156.9 million and net debt to total capital of 24.0% at March 31, 2017.\nNet capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2018 were $52.1 million including equipment acquired with capital leases. This compares to $108.2 million in net capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2017. The Company currently plans net capital expenditures in 2018 of approximately $265 million.\nConference Call\nManagement will hold a conference call to discuss quarterly results today at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
