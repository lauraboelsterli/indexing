    "text": "April 15, 2018 / 1:29 PM / Updated 30 minutes ago Montenegro veteran politician set to win presidential vote - projections Aleksandar Vasovic 2 Min Read \nPODGORICA (Reuters) - Veteran pro-European Union politician Milo Djukanovic was set to win Montenegro’s presidential election on Sunday with 53.5 percent of votes, according to a projection by the Centre for Monitoring and Research (CeMI) pollster.

REUTERS/Stevo Vasiljevic \nMladen Bojanic, a businessman backed by an alliance of parties, including some wanting closer ties with Russia, was set to come second with 34 percent, CeMI said, based on a partial count of the votes in a sample of polling stations. \nThe state election commission said turnout at 7.30 p.m (1730 GMT), half an hour before the polling stations closed, stood at 61.6 percent.

He announced his comeback last month citing “responsibility for Montenegro’s future”. \nDuring the campaign, opposition candidates accused Djukanovic of fostering cronyism, nepotism, corruption and ties with organised crime, which he denies.
