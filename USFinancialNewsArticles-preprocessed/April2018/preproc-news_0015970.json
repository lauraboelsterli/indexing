    "text": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese investors sold 3.924 trillion yen ($36.68 billion) of U.S. dollar bonds in February, the largest amount sold on record, Japanese government data showed on Monday, as rising costs of currency-hedging undercut their yield attraction.\nIt was their fifth straight month of net selling, during which they offloaded 7.675 trillion yen of U.S. bonds. Instead they bought euro-denominated bonds, scooping up 1.059 trillion yen in the same month.\nReporting by Hideyuki Sano; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ",
