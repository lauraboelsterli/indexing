    "text": "SAO PAULO, April 2 (Reuters) - Brazilâ€™s securities regulator, CVM, said on Monday it was probing possible insider trading at Banco Original, a bank that belongs to scandal-plagued J&F Investimentos, which has been at the center of a corruption scandal.\nThe regulator will look into transactions in interest rate futures and derivatives that occurred before the release of a plea deal by J&F controlling shareholders Joesley and Wesley Batista with Brazilian prosecutors.\nThe watchdog has already announced investigations into other J&F units.
