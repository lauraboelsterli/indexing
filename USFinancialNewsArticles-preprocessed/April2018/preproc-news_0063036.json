    "text": "BEIJING, April 30 (Reuters) - Growth in China’s manufacturing sector eased in April, as factory-gate prices stayed subdued in a possible sign of slowing domestic demand, while a simmering Sino-U.S. trade row heightened risks for the industrial sector.\nThe official Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) released on Monday fell to 51.4 in April, from 51.5 in March, and remained well above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.\nAnalysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast the reading would ease slightly to 51.3.\nThe weak findings add to concerns about an expected loss of momentum in the world’s second-largest economy, as policymakers navigate debt risks and a heated trade row with the United States.
