    "text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cambridge Bancorp (NASDAQ: CATC) (the “Company”), the parent of Cambridge Trust Company, today announced unaudited net income of $5,805,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $1,477,000, or 34.1%, compared to net income of $4,328,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Diluted earnings per share were $1.41 for the first quarter of 2018, representing a 33.0% increase over diluted earnings per share of $1.06 for the same quarter last year.\nFirst quarter 2018 highlights as compared to the first quarter of 2017 :\nWealth Management Assets under Management and Administration now at $3.1 billion, an increase of 12.3% Revenue of $23.3 million, an increase of 9.6% Loan growth of $70.9 million, or 5.4% Core deposit growth of $128.6 million, or 8.5% Federal statutory corporate tax rate decreased to 21% from 35%\n“We are pleased to report the Company delivered strong earnings during the first quarter of 2018,” noted Denis K. Sheahan, Chairman and CEO. “Cambridge Bancorp posted strong profitability metrics for the quarter with annualized return on average assets of 1.21% and annualized return on average shareholders’ equity of 15.80%. In the midst of continued loan payoffs, net loan growth resumed, and the Bank’s focus on core deposits, growth in noninterest income businesses, and expense control led to an increase in income before income taxes of 17.6% in the first quarter versus the same period a year ago.”\nBalance Sheet\nTotal assets increased $11.8 million, or 0.6%, from December 31, 2017 and were $2.0 billion as of March 31, 2018.\nTotal loans increased $30.9 million, or 2.3%, from December 31, 2017 and stood at $1.4 billion as of March 31, 2018. The growth in total loans was primarily due to the increase in commercial real estate loans of $22.6 million, from $633.6 million at December 31, 2017 to $656.3 million at March 31, 2018, and increases in commercial and industrial loans of $10.1 million, or 15.4%, from $65.3 million at December 31, 2017 to $75.4 million at March 31, 2018. Net loan growth during the quarter was healthy despite continued strong competition in the greater Boston area and continued elevated levels of loan payoffs.\nThe Company’s total investment securities portfolio increased by $25.1 million, or 5.7%, from $437.2 million at December 31, 2017 to $462.3 million at March 31, 2018.\nCore deposits, which the Company defines as all deposits other than certificates of deposit, increased by $20.6 million, or 1.3%, from December 31, 2017. The cost of total deposits for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was 0.22%, as compared to 0.17% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Total deposits at March 31, 2018 were $1.8 billion.\nNet Interest and Dividend Income\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, net interest and dividend income after provision for loan losses increased by $813,000, or 5.8%, to $14.7 million, as compared to $13.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Interest on loans increased $970,000, or 7.8%, which was driven by a combination of net loan growth and the impact of rising rates on our variable rate loan portfolio. The Company’s net interest margin, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, increased two basis points to 3.28% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to 3.26% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 using federal tax rates of 21% and 35%, respectively.\nNoninterest Income\nTotal noninterest income increased by $851,000, or 11.6%, to $8.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $7.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, primarily as a result of higher Wealth Management revenue and higher loan related derivative income associated with the Company’s interest rate risk strategy. Noninterest income was 35.1% of total revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Wealth Management revenue increased by $764,000, or 14.2%, for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to market appreciation. Wealth Management Assets under Management and Administration increased by $54.7 million, or 1.8%, from December 31, 2017 and ended at $3.1 billion as of March 31, 2018. Loan related derivative income increased $284,000 for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to the first quarter of 2017, due to the volume of derivative transactions executed in the first quarter of 2018.\nNoninterest income increases were partially offset by lower gains on loans held for sale of $208,000 and lower deposit account fee income of $63,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nNoninterest Expense\nTotal noninterest expense increased by $555,000, or 3.7%, to $15.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $14.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, primarily driven by higher salaries and employee benefits expense and higher marketing expense. The increase in salaries and employee benefits expense of $917,000 was driven by the combination of increased staffing to support business initiatives, higher employee benefit costs, and the adoption of new accounting guidance (“ASU 2017-07”) for net periodic pension costs and net periodic postretirement benefit costs. The amount added to salaries and benefits expense from the adoption of ASU 2017-07 during the first quarter of 2018 was approximately $239,000, which was correspondingly recorded as a decrease in other expense during the first quarter of 2018. The adoption of ASU 2017-07 required that the Company represent the impacted line items for the first quarter of 2017. The result of this retrospective application for the first quarter of 2017 was a decrease in salaries and benefits expense of approximately $56,000 and a corresponding increase in other expense for the same amount. The increase of $168,000 in marketing expense was due to the increased focus of growing brand awareness within our markets.\nNoninterest expense increases were partially offset by lower other expenses of $418,000 primarily resulting from the adoption of new accounting guidance for net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost as discussed above, lower data processing costs of $93,000, and lower occupancy and equipment expenses of $26,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to March 31, 2017.\nAsset Quality\nLoan quality remained sound with non-performing loans totaling $1.5 million, or 0.11% of total loans outstanding as of March 31, 2018. The allowance for loan losses was $15.7 million, or 1.14% of total loans outstanding at March 31, 2018, as compared to $15.3 million, or 1.13% of total loans outstanding at year end 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nIn accordance with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the Company’s federal statutory corporate tax rate decreased from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The effective tax rate was 21.8% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to 31.4% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Additionally, the Company recognized $148,000 of tax benefit resulting from the accounting for share-based payments during the first quarter of 2018.\nDividend\nOn April 17, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.48 per share, which is payable on May 17, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 3, 2018. This represents an increase of $0.02 per share, as compared to $0.46 per share declared during the same quarter of 2017.\nAbout Cambridge Bancorp\nCambridge Bancorp, the parent company of Cambridge Trust Company, is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
