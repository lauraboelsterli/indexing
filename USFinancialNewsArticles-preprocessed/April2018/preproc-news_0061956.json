Apr 27, 2018; Anaheim, CA, USA; Los Angeles Angels starting pitcher Shohei Ohtani (17) circles the bases on his solo home run off of New York Yankees starting pitcher Luis Severino (40) (not pictured) in the second inning of the game at Angel Stadium of Anaheim. Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports\nOhtani sustained a left ankle injury while trying to beat out an infield hit against the New York Yankees on Friday.\nHe said the following day that he expected to be ready to pitch on Tuesday but the Angels said he was not ready.\n“He’s just not right now ready to go out there and run full speed like you would like to see,” Angels manager Mike Scioscia said on Sunday of Ohtani, who has been held out of the team’s starting lineup for the last two games. Apr 27, 2018; Anaheim, CA, USA; Los Angeles Angels starting pitcher Shohei Ohtani (17) breaks his bat and is thrown out at first base in the fourth inning of the game against the New York Yankees at Angel Stadium of Anaheim. Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports\nScioscia added the team would not place Ohtani on the disabled list.\n“There’s a possibility that he throws a bullpen (session on Monday), but we’re still evaluating it,” he said.\nOhtani is 2-1 with a 4.43 ERA in four starts as a pitcher for the Angels.\nAs a hitter, Ohtani is batting .341 with four home runs and 12 RBIs in 44 at-bats over 12 games.
