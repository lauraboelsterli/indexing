    "text": "Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has empowered the Justice Department's special counsel to investigate allegations that President Donald Trump 's former campaign chairman colluded with the Russian government.\nThat detail is revealed in a court document filed late Monday by special counsel Robert Mueller defending the scope of his investigation.\nPaul Manafort , who led the Trump campaign for parts of 2016, has challenged Mueller's authority and asked a judge to dismiss an indictment against him.\nBut in its court filing, Mueller disclosed a memo from last August in which Rosenstein specified allegations that were within the scope of his investigation.\nAmong those is an allegation that Manafort colluded with Russian government officials to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.\nNone of the charges Manafort currently faces alleges co-ordination with the Kremlin.",
