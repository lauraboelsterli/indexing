FILE PHOTO: Safra A. Catz, Chief Executive Officer, Oracle, speaks at 2017 SelectUSA Investment Summit in Oxon Hill, Maryland, U.S., June 19, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts \nCatz told reporters in Tel Aviv that the company’s cloud business was impacted by a new model made available to customers three quarters ago that resulted in much higher than projected license growth. \n“That makes the appearance of a lower number (for the cloud business) even though money is actually coming in to another bucket,” Catz said. \n“As this evens out I think we are going to start seeing cloud acceleration again that is very significant but I don’t want to time that right now.” \nOracle last month said its quarterly cloud business revenue rose 31.7 percent to $1.57 billion, but fell short of the average analysts’ estimate of $1.59 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
