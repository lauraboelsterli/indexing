DHX Media co-founder, Steven DeNure, will be transitioning out of his role as President and COO within the next month.\nIn his role as COO, Mr. Ames will be responsible for the Company's overall operations, and will oversee its broadcast channels, DHX Television, and its licensing agency, CPLG. As President, Mr. Scherba will oversee the Company's content business, including development, production and distribution, as well as its YouTube-based kids' network, WildBrain. As CCO, Ms. Loi will oversee key external partnerships, content production and financing, and business analytics.\n\"We have added operational depth to our senior team with the appointment of Aaron, and aligned key content and distribution responsibilities under Josh and Anne to leverage and focus their strengths,\" said Michael Donovan, Executive Chair and CEO of DHX Media. \"Aaron has a long history with DHX Media, having served for a period as Chief Integration Officer, following our acquisition of Cookie Jar Entertainment, where he was CFO. His proficiency and discipline in operational and finance matters have become evident through his subsequent work with us on many projects as a consultant. These skills are the ideal complements to Josh and Anne's deep experience and expertise in our content business. I look forward to working with all three, along with the rest of the senior management team, as we embark on the next chapter in DHX Media's story.\"\n\"These changes are part of our succession plan,\" said Mr. DeNure. \"I have been working with Josh and Anne for the past 18 years, and I know they will excel in these well-deserved new roles. Aaron is a great and familiar addition to the DHX Media team.\"\nMr. Donovan added: \"After an exceptional 35-year career, Steven has decided that it's time to enjoy his successes. We are grateful for his contribution to DHX Media and we wish him well in the future.\"\nAbout Aaron Ames\nAaron Ames, Chief Operating Officer of DHX Media, has had a long career in management roles for public and private companies.
