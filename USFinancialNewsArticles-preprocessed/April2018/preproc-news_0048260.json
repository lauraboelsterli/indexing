Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond arrives in Downing Street, London, April 24, 2018. REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n“We are discussing with European Union partners the measures that the U.S. and others have taken,” Hammond told lawmakers in Britain’s parliament.\n“I think it’s probably fair to say that there are varying degrees of appetite within the European Union for further pressure on this group of individuals. And one of the challenges, working within the European Union, is that ... one is required to build a consensus of 28, which means operating frankly at the lower common denominator.” Reporting by David Milliken, writing by William Schomberg",
