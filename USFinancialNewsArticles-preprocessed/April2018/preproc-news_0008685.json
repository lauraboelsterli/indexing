    "text": "LEAWOOD, Kan., April 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Aratana Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: PETX), a pet therapeutics company focused on the licensing, development and commercialization of innovative therapeutics for dogs and cats, confirmed that it has received a notice of nomination of three director candidates for election to the Company's Board of Directors at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders from Engaged Capital, LLC and certain of its affiliated entities, which earlier today filed a Schedule 13D disclosing ownership of 5.2% of Aratana's outstanding shares.\nAratana stockholders are not required to take any action at this time. Members of Aratana's Board and management have recently held discussions with representatives of Engaged Capital and those discussions are ongoing. Aratana's Board intends to review the qualifications and experience of the nominees and present its formal recommendation regarding director nominations in the Company's proxy materials that will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAbout Aratana Therapeutics\nAratana Therapeutics is a pet therapeutics company focused on licensing, developing and commercializing innovative therapeutics for dogs and cats. Aratana believes that it can leverage the investment in the human biopharmaceutical industry to bring therapeutics to dogs and cats in a capital and time efficient manner. The company's pipeline includes therapeutic candidates for the potential treatment of pain, inappetence, viral diseases, allergy, cancer and other serious medical conditions. Aratana believes the development and commercialization of these therapeutics will permit veterinarians and pet owners to manage pets' medical needs safely and effectively, resulting in longer and improved quality of life for pets.

These statements are neither promises nor guarantees, but are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in these forward-looking statements. Existing and prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include the fact that Aratana may choose not to consider Engaged Capital's nominees, and the other factors discussed in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities law.\nImportant Stockholder Information and Where You Can Find It\nAratana plans to file with the SEC and mail to its stockholders a definitive proxy statement and accompanying definitive WHITE proxy card in connection with the Company's 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
