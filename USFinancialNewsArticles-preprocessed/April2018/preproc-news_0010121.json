    "text": "Google is in advanced talks to buy Nokia's airborne broadband system, Bloomberg reports , citing multiple sources with knowledge of the discussions. \nGoogle would use Nokia's technology to offer faster in-flight WiFi. \nNokia announced its air-to-ground connectivity network late last year with internet speeds as fast or faster than those of the in-flight internet company Gogo. Having its own WiFi system on planes could allow Google to funnel people towards its entertainment products, like YouTube or Play Music. \nIf an acquisition goes through, it will be one of several connectivity-focused projects that Google parent company Alphabet is working on. There's Fiber, a stalled effort to blanket the country with super-fast internet service; Loon, which uses giant balloons to beam internet to remote areas; and a partnership with Starbucks to provide WiFi to customers. \nBloomberg reports that the in-flight WiFi technology is less of a priority for Nokia than its other telecom efforts. For example, in February Nokia acquired a mesh WiFi startup that works with Google Fiber as it tries to makes a push into home WiFi.\nAlphabet and Nokia didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. \nRead the full Bloomberg report here.",
