There will also be a single Twenty20 International played in Colombo on Aug. 14.\nThe original tour schedule had involved three tests, according to reports, but Sri Lanka Cricket asked for one of these to be replaced by an extended limited overs series that is more commercially viable.\n“This will be a very important tour for us,” CSA acting Chief Executive Thabang Moroe said in a statement.\n“We have a lot of exciting, young players coming into our side in all three formats and, with so much of our international cricket being played on the sub-continent these days it is important they get used to those conditions as soon as possible.\n“The ODI series forms an important part of our team preparation for next year’s World Cup in England.”\nReporting By Nick Said; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ",
