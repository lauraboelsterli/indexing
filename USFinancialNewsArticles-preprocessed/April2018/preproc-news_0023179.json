    "text": "KING OF PRUSSIA, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- QuadGen , a global network and engineering services company, today announced a member of its Board, Dr. Arogyaswami Paulraj, will be inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame for 2018 on May 3 rd .\nDr. Paulraj pioneered Multiple Input, Multiple Output (MIMO), a wireless technology that has revolutionized broadband wireless internet access for billions of people worldwide. MIMO improves both transmission data rates and expands network coverage. It is the essential foundation for all current (Wi-Fi and 4G mobile) and future broadband wireless communications.\nBorn in India, Paulraj joined the Indian Navy at age 15. The Navy sent him to the Indian Institute of Technology (Delhi), where he earned a Ph.D. for advances to signal filtering theory. The loss of an Indian naval ship from submarine action in the 1971 Indo-Pakistan War brought Paulraj to sonar technology and he advanced the Indian Navy’s sonar capability. In 1977, he led the design of the APSOH sonar which became the fleet sonar of the Indian Navy, ushering in India’s global leadership in this vital technology. Paulraj later founded three national labs in India spanning artificial intelligence, computing and military electronics, before joining the faculty at Stanford University. Shortly after joining Stanford, he identified surprising results in signal separability that became the genesis of MIMO.\nPaulraj founded Iospan Wireless Inc. (acquired by Intel ), and developed a MIMO-based cellular wireless technology that became the basis for WiMAX and LTE mobile networks. He also co-founded Beceem Communications (acquired by Broadcom ), which became a global leader in WiMAX semiconductors. Currently professor emeritus at Stanford , Paulraj holds 79 patents and has received numerous awards, including the 2014 Marconi Prize .\n“Dr. Paulraj is an amazing individual. We are thrilled to have his guidance on our Board of Directors and delighted to see him receive this well-deserved recognition for his contributions to wireless technology,” said Mallik Vagvala , Global CEO and Founder of QuadGen.\n“Truly a well-deserved lifetime recognition for a scientist, academician, and inventor who laid the foundation for wireless broadband. Dr. Paulraj made gigabit wireless speeds and mobile video a reality through his invention of MIMO,” said CS Rao , Chairman and Founder of QuadGen. “We at QuadGen are honored, fortunate, and blessed to have him serve on our Board.”\n“It has been a privilege being able to work with Dr. Paulraj on the Board of Directors. He is not only a terrific asset to our company but a true gentleman as well,” said Leighton Carroll , President of QuadGen.\nAbout QuadGen:\nQuadGen is a network and engineering services company, enabling customers to deploy new technologies, improve network capacity, reduce costs and optimize network performance. Our highly-trained staff, in-house proprietary tools and breadth of capabilities enable QuadGen to deliver the highest quality of network improvements that unlock value with velocity and precision.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180412005195/en/\nfor QuadGen\nJohn Walker\nJohn@ChirpPR.com\nSource: QuadGen",
