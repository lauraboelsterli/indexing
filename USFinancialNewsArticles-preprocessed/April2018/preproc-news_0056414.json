    "text": "April 27, 2018 / 2:03 AM / Updated 27 minutes ago Under pressure from Elliott, Hyundai Motor to cancel $890 million in shares Hyunjoo Jin 2 Min Read\nSEOUL (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor ( 005380.KS ) said on Friday it plans to cancel 960 billion won ($890 million) worth of treasury shares, its first share cancellation in 14 years, to boost shareholder returns. The logo of Hyundai Motor is seen at its dealership in Seoul, South Korea, April 26, 2017. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji\nU.S. activist hedge fund Elliott Management on Monday ramped up pressure on the South Korean automaker, calling for a holding company structure and a share cancellation, among other suggestions.\nHyundai also reported on Thursday that its quarterly profit halved to an almost six-year low, hit by bleak U.S. and China sales. FILE PHOTO - The logo of Hyundai Motor is seen on the steering wheel of a Sonata sedan car during its unveiling ceremony in Seoul, South Korea, March 8, 2017. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji\nHyundai plans to cancel 560 billion won of existing treasury shares by July 27, and will buy back and cancel another 400 billion won worth of stock, the company said in a statement.\nThis is its first share cancellation since 2004.\nHyundaiâ€™s shares reversed earlier losses after the announcement, rising as much as 3.2 percent before trading 0.6 percent higher as of 0135 GMT.\n($1 = 1,076.4000 won)\n(This version of the story corrects headline to cancellation, not buyback) Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin; Editing by Edwina Gibbs",
