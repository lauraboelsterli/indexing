    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cowen Inc. (NASDAQ:COWN) (“Cowen” or “the Company”) today announced its operating results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancial Highlights\nGAAP\nRevenue rose 119% year over year to a record $251.4 million compared to $115.0 million in the prior year period. Net income attributable to common stockholders was $15.2 million or $0.50 per diluted common share compared to $1.3 million or $0.05 per diluted common share in the prior year period. The Company adopted ASC Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (\"ASC Topic 606\") as amended. The Company applied this new revenue recognition guidance using the modified retrospective method effective January 1, 2018 and therefore there is no impact on previously issued results. The effect on the current quarter results is outlined within this press release.\nEconomic Income (Non-GAAP)\nThe Company achieved a new revenue quarterly high. Revenue increased 88% year over year to $241.5 million compared to $128.6 million in the prior year period. The Company also generated record Economic Income of $24.1 million or $0.79 per diluted share compared to Economic Income of $5.5 million or $0.19 per diluted share in the prior year period.\nOperating Highlights\nOn a GAAP and economic income basis, investment banking revenue increased 168% and 157% year over year to $98.0 million and $93.9 million, respectively. The quarter was led by very strong performance in equity financings as well as a growing contribution from advisory and non-healthcare sectors. Brokerage revenue rose 109% and 118% year over year to $105.7 million and $114.1 million on a GAAP and economic income basis, respectively. The increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Convergex in June 2017. As of April 1, 2018, assets under management were $10.8 billion, a $0.2 billion decrease from January 1, 2018. On a GAAP basis, the compensation to revenue ratio was 47% compared to 50% in the prior year period. On an economic income basis, the compensation to revenue ratio declined to 56% from 58% due to a shift in business mix as a result of the Convergex acquisition. Book value per share was $22.27 as of March 31, 2018, compared to $21.82 as of December 31, 2017. Tangible book value per share was $19.25 as of March 31, 2018 compared to $18.77 as of December 31, 2017.\nSummary Financial Highlights\n(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share information) Three Months Ended March 31, Dec. 31, 2018 2017 % 2017 % GAAP: Revenue $ 251.4 $ 115.0 119% $ 204.5 23% Net income (loss) attributable to Cowen common stockholders $ 15.2 $ 1.3 NM $ (77.8 ) NM Earnings (loss) per share (diluted) $ 0.50 $ 0.05 NM $ (2.51 ) NM Economic Income (non-GAAP): Economic income revenue $ 241.5 $ 128.6 88% $ 183.0 32% Economic income (loss) attributable to Cowen $ 24.1 $ 5.5 341% $ (9.4 ) NM Economic income per share (diluted) $ 0.79 $ 0.19 311% $ (0.30 ) NM Note: Amounts may not add due to rounding. NM indicates not meaningful. A reconciliation of\neconomic income (loss) to net income appears under the section, \"Summary Economic Income\n(Loss) to GAAP Reconciliation.\"\nJeffrey M. Solomon, Chief Executive Officer of Cowen, said, \"We started off the year with our strongest quarterly performance since the formation of Cowen Inc. in 2009. Results were driven largely by growth in our investment banking and brokerage businesses. These results reflect the decisions we made to scale businesses, drive margin and diversify revenue streams. We also continued to make progress on integration and expense control post the Convergex acquisition. During the quarter, we also made good initial progress on newer capital allocation initiatives that we expect to improve long term shareholder value.\"\nGAAP Financial Review\nSummary GAAP Financial Information\n(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share information) Three Months Ended March 31, Dec. 31, 2018 2017 % 2017 % Revenue $ 251.4 $ 115.0 119% $ 204.5 23% Net income (loss) attributable to Cowen $ 16.9 $ 3.0 NM $ (76.0 ) NM Preferred stock dividends $ 1.7 $ 1.7 —% $ 1.7 —% Net income (loss) attributable to Cowen common stockholders $ 15.2 $ 1.3 NM $ (77.8 ) NM Earnings (loss) per share (diluted) $0.50 $0.05 NM $(2.51) NM Note: Amounts may not add due to rounding. NM indicates not meaningful. Revenue was $251.4 million compared to $115.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Convergex in June 2017 and strong performance in investment banking as well as an increase in interest and dividends attributable to securities financing activities and debt issued during 2014 and 2017.\nEmployee compensation and benefits expense increased $58.5 million from the prior year period to $135.1 million. The increase was primarily due to $136.4 million higher revenue, which resulted in a higher compensation and benefits accrual, and increased headcount from the Convergex acquisition.\nInterest and dividend expense was $24.5 million compared to $9.9 million in the prior year period. This was primarily attributable to securities finance activities related to the June 2017 acquisition of Convergex.\nReinsurance-related expense of $8.7 million increased $2.6 million from the year ago period. This increase was was due to additional reinsurance policies the Company entered into in late 2017.\nOperating, general, administrative and other expenses increased $36.6 million year over year to $76.2 million. The increase is primarily related to higher floor brokerage and trade execution costs, due to higher brokerage revenue, as well as increased marketing and business development expenses, legal and other professional fees and occupancy costs, which are mostly related to the acquisition of Convergex in June 2017.\nDepreciation and amortization expense of $3.2 million increased $0.2 million from the prior year period. The increase was primarily related to an increase in amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisition of Convergex in June 2017.\nOther income was $33.8 million compared to $39.4 million in the prior year period. The decrease primarily related to a decrease in performance of the Company's own invested capital.\nIncome tax expense was $6.9 million compared to an income tax expense of $1.9 million in the prior year quarter. This change is primarily attributable to higher taxes due to the Company’s operating results, partially offset by the impact of the new reduced statutory Federal tax rate enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nIncome (loss) attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests increased by $2.1 million to $11.2 million from the prior year period. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in income earned by the event driven and private healthcare consolidated funds in the current year period.\nRevenue Recognition\nASC Topic 606 resulted in a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings, as of January 1, 2018, of $0.6 million related to uncrystallized incentive fees. During the first quarter of 2018 we deferred $0.4 million of uncrystallized incentive fees and certain incentive fees allocated to the Company are now presented under an equity ownership model as net gains (losses) on securities. ASC Topic 606 also changed the presentation of underwriting expenses to a gross basis which are now included within our total expenses. ASC Topic 606 was not applied to economic income (loss) reporting.\nCapital\nSelect Balance Sheet Data\n(Amounts in millions, except per share information) March 31, Dec. 31, March 31, 2018 2017 2017 Cowen Inc. stockholders' equity $758.8 $748.0 $778.3 Common equity (CE) $657.5 $646.7 $676.9 Tangible common equity (TCE) $568.2 $556.1 $591.8 Book value per share (CE/CSO) $22.27 $21.82 $24.79 Tangible book value per share (TCE/CSO) $19.25 $18.77 $21.67 Common shares outstanding (CSO) 29.5 29.6 27.3 Reconciliation of GAAP Cowen Inc. stockholders' equity to tangible common equity: Cowen Inc. stockholders' equity $758.8 $748.0 $778.3 Less: Preferred stock 101.3 101.3 101.3 Common equity (CE) $657.5 $646.7 $676.9 Less: Goodwill & intangibles 89.2 90.6 85.1 Tangible common equity (TCE) $568.2 $556.1 $591.8 Note: Amounts may not add due to rounding.

In general, Economic Income (Loss) is a pre-tax measure that (i) eliminates the impact of consolidation for consolidated funds and excludes (ii) goodwill and intangible impairment (iii) certain other transaction-related adjustments and/or reorganization expenses (iv) certain costs associated with debt and (v) preferred stock dividends. In addition, Economic Income (Loss) revenues include investment income that represents the income the Company has earned in investing its own capital, including realized and unrealized gains and losses, interest and dividends, net of associated investment related expenses.

For US GAAP purposes, all of these items, are recorded in other income (loss). Economic Income (Loss) recognizes incentive fees during periods when the fees are not yet crystallized for US GAAP reporting. In addition, Economic Income (Loss) expenses are reduced by reimbursement from affiliates, which for US GAAP purposes is presented gross as part of revenue.\nFor a more complete description of Economic Income (Loss) and a reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) to Economic Income (Loss) for the periods presented and additional information regarding the reconciling adjustments, please see the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section of this press release.\nEconomic Income (Non-GAAP) Financial Review\nSummary Economic Income (Loss) Financial Information\n(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share information) Three Months Ended March 31, Dec. 31, 2018 2017 % 2017 % Revenue $ 241.5 $ 128.6 88% $ 183.0 32% Economic Income (Loss) $ 24.1 $ 5.5 341% $ (9.4 ) NM Economic Income (Loss) per share (diluted) $ 0.79 $ 0.19 311% $ (0.30 ) NM Note: Amounts may not add due to rounding.

The lower compensation to Economic Income revenue ratio is due to a shift in the Company's overall business mix as a result of the acquisition of Convergex in June 2017.

The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures, viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the Company’s reported GAAP results, provide useful information to investors regarding its performance and overall results of operations. These metrics are an integral part of the Company’s internal reporting to measure the performance of its businesses and the overall effectiveness of senior management. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures are available in the accompanying schedules. The non-GAAP measures presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other public companies, and are not identical to corresponding measures used in our various agreements or public filings.\nEconomic Income (Loss)\nEconomic Income (Loss) may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other public companies. Cowen uses Economic Income (Loss) as a measure of its operating performance, not as a measure of liquidity. Economic Income (Loss) should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income, net income, operating cash flows, investing and financing activities, or other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. As a result of the adjustments made to arrive at Economic Income (Loss) described below, Economic Income (Loss) has limitations in that it does not take into account certain items included or excluded under GAAP, including its consolidated funds. Economic Income (Loss) is considered by management as a supplemental measure to the GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of its performance as management measures it.\nIn general, Economic Income (Loss) is a pre-tax measure that (i) eliminates the impact of consolidation for consolidated funds and excludes (ii) goodwill and intangible impairment (iii) certain other transaction-related adjustments and/or reorganization expenses (iv) certain costs associated with debt and (v) preferred stock dividends. In addition, Economic Income (Loss) revenues include investment income that represents the income the Company has earned in investing its own capital, including realized and unrealized gains and losses, interest and dividends, net of associated investment related expenses. For US GAAP purposes, these items are included in each of their respective line items. Economic Income (Loss) revenues also include management fees, incentive income and investment income earned through the Company's investment as a general partner in certain real estate entities and the Company's investment in the activist business and certain funds. For US GAAP purposes, all of these items, are recorded in other income (loss). Economic Income (Loss) recognizes incentive fees during periods when the fees are not yet crystallized for US GAAP reporting. In addition, Economic Income (Loss) expenses are reduced by reimbursement from affiliates, which for US GAAP purposes is presented gross as part of revenue.\nCowen Inc.
