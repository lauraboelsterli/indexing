LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) SGX Nifty nearest-month futures at 10,546.50, little changed from its previous close. The Indian rupee is expected to open higher against the dollar after President Donald Trump's remarks pulled the U.S. currency to its lowest in three weeks. Indian sovereign bonds are likely to open little changed, ahead of state debt supply and after monsoon forecast was on the expected lines. The yield on the benchmark 7.17 pct bond maturing in 2028 may trade in a 7.45 pct-7.52 pct band today. GLOBAL MARKETS • U.S. stocks closed higher on Monday, with the biggest boosts from technology and healthcare sectors as investors were optimistic about earnings season and appeared less worried about U.S.-led missile attacks in Syria. • Asia stocks edged higher, tracking Wall Street gains as the focus shifted to corporate earnings and looming economic data from China amid signs Western-led strikes on Syria weren't likely to escalate. • The dollar steadied as the market's focus shifted back to U.S. trade policy as investors wagered U.S.-led attacks on Syria would not escalate into a wider conflict in the Middle East. • The U.S. yield curve reached it flattest level in over a decade on Monday afternoon as the White House said President Trump will nominate economist Richard Clarida as Federal Reserve Vice Chairman. • Oil prices rose amid worries there could be a high risk of disruptions to supply, especially in the Middle East. • Gold prices edged higher as the U.S. dollar slipped further, making bullion less expensive for holders of other currencies.
