    "text": "The tide might be turning when it comes to retirement savings in America. For the third year in a row, GOBankingRates surveyed adults across the U.S. to find out how much the average person has saved for retirement.\nFrom 2016 to 2017, the percentage of Americans with $0 saved increased . But this year, it dropped — dramatically. Not only has the percentage of adults with nothing saved fallen, but the percentage of those with $300,000 or more in a retirement nest egg has increased.\nMore from GOBankingRates:\nWomen aren't living as comfortably as men in retirement — here's why",
