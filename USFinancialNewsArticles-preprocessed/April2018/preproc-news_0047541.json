    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Naturally Splendid Enterprises Ltd. (“Naturally Splendid” or “NSE”) (TSX-V:NSP) (OTCQB:NSPDF) (Frankfurt:50N) is pleased to announce the acquisition of Absorbent Concepts Inc.(“ACI”), an organic hemp processor located in Abbotsford, B.C.\nNaturally Splendid CEO Mr. Douglas Mason states, “The acquisition of ACI represents a major milestone for NSE creating a critical link in becoming a truly vertically integrated, industrial hemp biotech and consumer products company. In addition to capturing more value chain margin with our existing industrial hemp lines, the addition of the expertise within ACI strengthens our Dealer License application and provides significant resources as we continue on the path to add a cannabinoid extraction facility.”\nAs stated in a previous news release dated February 6 th, 2018, the regulatory purpose for a Dealer License is to enable legal possession of regulated substances such as cannabidiol (CBD) for the purposes of formulating, manufacturing, distributing and import/export.\nAbsorbent Concepts Inc. (doing business as ACI Foods) is a science-based, industrial hemp seed processing business located in Abbotsford, BC. Listed as the only strictly organic hemp seed processor in North America, ACI is a significant producer of hulled seed, hemp seed oil and high percentage protein powder, among a long list of in-development nutritional products and processes. Although ACI has specialized in processing organic hemp products, operations will be expanded to accommodate the ability to provide a full range of conventional hemp products.\nIn business since November 2013, ACI was conceived by Pete Scales, an entrepreneur, inventor/R&D specialist, applied scientist, lecturer and long time believer in the power and many gifts of hemp, including full plant utilization, which in turn includes cannabinoid extraction. In addition to a wealth of hemp processing knowledge and experience, the ACI team brings to NSE a substantial body of technical expertise in cannabinoid extraction, nutritional product development, laboratory analysis, as well as long-standing contractual relationships with farmers. These relationships will be leveraged to forge secure supply agreements for organic and conventional industrial hemp for the traditional seed harvest, and also for new opportunities in the CBD cultivation pursuant to the anticipated Cannabis Act being revised by the Canadian Federal Government later this year. In fiscal 2017, ACI recorded total revenues of $1,080,869 (unaudited) and a loss of $119,714 (unaudited). In ACI’s first quarter, total revenues were $156,670 (unaudited) which resulted in a loss of $114,644 (unaudited).\nAccording to an article published by Hempster on April 16 th , 2018, “Hemp is a much richer source of CBD than marijuana, and it makes economic sense to extract CBD from this abundant crop. Currently, Canadian farmers are forced to destroy the leaves and flowers of their hemp plants. But this will all change when the Cannabis Act comes into effect, likely in the late summer or fall of 2018. Once enacted, hemp farmers will be able to sell their crops to licensed producers for CBD extraction.”\nCanadian Hemp Trade Alliance President and Naturally Splendid Director Russell Crawford states, “As holders of a Dealers License, Naturally Splendid will be positioned to leverage the upcoming whole plant utilization regulations. ACI’s relationship with farmers is a great catalyst in securing acreage for CBD production.”\nThe acquisition of ACI by Naturally Splendid is pursuant to the terms of the share purchase agreement among ACI, Pete Scales and Naturally Splendid. Naturally Splendid acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of ACI in consideration of repaying and/or assuming certain bank loans of ACI that total $640,018.\nAbout Naturally Splendid Enterprises Ltd.\nNaturally Splendid is a biotechnology and consumer products company that is developing, producing, commercializing, and licensing an entirely new generation of plant-derived, bioactive ingredients, nutrient dense foods, and related products.
