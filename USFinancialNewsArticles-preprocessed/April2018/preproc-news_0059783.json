    "text": "DUNDALK, Ireland, The European Union’s Brexit negotiator said on Monday that he is confident Brussels and London can agree on the right solution for avoiding the return of a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n“I am confident that together with unity of the EU27 and a constructive attitude on both sides, we will be able to agree the right solution for avoiding a hard border and maintaining north-south co-operation with all its diversity,” Michel Barnier said in a speech at the Irish border town of Dundalk.\n“Agreement on the orderly withdrawal, including a backstop (agreement on the border) for Ireland, will pave the way for constructive negotiations for a broad partnership for the future.” (Reporting by Padraic Halpin Editing by Alison Williams)\n ",
