(NYSE: GDI) announced today first quarter revenues of $619.6 million, up 29% compared to the prior year and a 22% increase excluding the impact of foreign currency (“FX”).\nNet income attributable to Gardner Denver in the quarter was $42.4 million, or $0.20 per share based on share count of 209.9 million, compared to a prior year net loss attributable to Gardner Denver of $7.1 million, or a $0.05 loss per share based on share count of 148.5 million. Adjusted net income increased 301% to $80.7 million, or $0.38 per share, compared to $20.1 million, or $0.13 per share, in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $148.2 million, up 61% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues expanded 480 basis points to 23.9% as compared to 19.1% in the prior year. The margin expansion versus prior year was primarily driven by strong volume gains and operational improvements within the Industrials and Energy segments, as both segments saw double digit revenue increases versus prior year supported by solid end market activity. In addition, corporate expenses were favorable versus prior year largely driven by a $5.6 million insurance recovery for previously expensed legal defense costs.\nIn the first quarter, Gardner Denver generated $60.2 million of cash flow from operating activities and invested $10.1 million in capital expenditures, resulting in free cash flow of $50.1 million, as compared to the prior year outflow of $19.0 million. First quarter net debt to Adjusted EBITDA leverage improved to 2.8x from 2.9x as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 largely due to the improved Adjusted EBITDA performance. The first quarter leverage position is also reflective of the approximately $95 million paid from cash on hand to acquire Runtech Systems in February of 2018.\nBusiness Trends and Outlook\n“We are off to a strong start in 2018 with outstanding execution from our team combined with broad-based growth across each of our segments. All three of our segments saw strong orders and revenue performance and we continue to focus on operational efficiency as evidenced by the 61% Adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion of 480 basis points,” said Vicente Reynal, Chief Executive Officer.\n“In the Industrials segment, we continue to see significant growth across all three regions and our team continues to execute on our key strategic imperatives of innovation and market expansion across our major product technologies of compressors, blowers, and vacuums. In addition, we are making solid progress on integrating the Runtech business into the Industrials commercial and operational infrastructure. In the Energy segment, demand remains strong, particularly in our upstream business, as original equipment frac pumps and aftermarket consumables, such as valves and seats and packing, saw the largest growth over prior year. The mid and downstream businesses also saw solid growth in line with our expectations. In the Medical segment, healthy double-digit order intake across both gas and liquid pumps led to positive organic revenue growth for the first quarter since early 2017.”\n“I am very pleased with the progress we are seeing across the entire business as we continue to execute on our simple four-point strategy of building and deploying talent across the organization, accelerating growth, expanding margins, and effectively allocating capital,” added Reynal. “The results are evident in our first quarter financials and we remain focused on executing through the balance of the year.”\nFirst quarter 2018 performance:\nIndustrials\nOrders of $337.8 million, up 18% compared to the prior year, and up 10% excluding the impact of FX Revenues of $316.9 million, up 28% compared to the prior year, and up 19% excluding the impact of FX Segment Adjusted EBITDA of $66.8 million, up 42% from $47.2 million in the prior year Segment Adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.1%, up 210 basis points from 19.0% in the prior year\nEnergy\nOrders of $291.0 million, up 19% compared to the prior year, and up 16% excluding the impact of FX Revenues of $242.2 million, up 36% compared to the prior year, and up 33% excluding the impact of FX Segment Adjusted EBITDA of $68.0 million, up 77% from $38.5 million in the prior year Segment Adjusted EBITDA margin of 28.1%, up 650 basis points from 21.6% in the prior year\nMedical\nOrders of $75.0 million, up 19% compared to the prior year, and up 11% excluding the impact of FX Revenues of $60.5 million, up 9% compared to the prior year, and up 1% excluding the impact of FX Segment Adjusted EBITDA of $15.9 million, up 9% from $14.6 million in the prior year Segment Adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.3%, down 10 basis points from 26.4% in the prior year\n2018 Guidance and Outlook\n“We are raising our full year 2018 Adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $685 million to $705 million from our prior outlook of $650 million to $670 million,” stated Reynal. “Given our strong double-digit orders growth in the quarter across all three segments and the encouraging demand environment we continue to see, we expect solid performance for the balance of 2018 and have raised our outlook accordingly. In addition, we expect continued improvement in our leverage ratio and are targeting a net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.1x to 2.3x by year end, excluding the impact of any potential future M&A.”\nConference Call\nGardner Denver will broadcast a conference call to discuss results for on Friday, April 27, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. Eastern time (7:00 a.m. Central time) through a live webcast.

These statements include, but are not limited to, statements related to our expectations regarding the performance of our business, our financial results, our liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements, including the statements in the \"Business Trends and Outlook” and “2018 Guidance\" sections of this press release. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of words such as \"outlook,\" “guidance,” \"believes,\" \"expects,\" \"potential,\" \"continues,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"seeks,\" \"projects,\" \"predicts,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"estimates,\" \"anticipates\" or the negative version of these words or other comparable words. Such forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including macroeconomic factors beyond the Company’s control, risks of doing business outside the United States, the Company’s dependence on the level of activity in the energy industry, potential governmental regulations restricting the use of hydraulic fracturing, raw material costs and availability, the risk of a loss or reduction of business with key customers or consolidation or the vertical integration of the Company’s customer base, loss of or disruption in the Company’s distribution network, the risk that ongoing and expected restructuring plans may not be as effective as the Company anticipates, and the Company’s substantial indebtedness. Additional factors that could cause Gardner Denver’s results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found under the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in our most recent annual report on form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), as such factors may be updated from time to time in our periodic filings with the SEC, which are accessible on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov . Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in these statements. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in this release and in our filings with the SEC. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by law.\nAbout Gardner Denver\nGardner Denver (NYSE: GDI) is a leading global provider of mission-critical flow control and compression equipment and associated aftermarket parts, consumables and services, which it sells across multiple attractive end-markets within the industrial, energy and medical industries.

Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain non-cash, non-recurring and other adjustment items. Adjusted Net Income is defined as net income (loss) including interest, depreciation and amortization of non-acquisition related intangible assets and excluding other items used to calculate Adjusted EBITDA and further adjusted for the tax effect of these exclusions. Gardner Denver believes that the adjustments applied in presenting Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain material non-cash items and about non-recurring items that the Company does not expect to continue at the same level in the future. Adjusted Diluted EPS is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by Adjusted Diluted Average Shares Outstanding.\nGardner Denver uses Free Cash Flow to review the liquidity of its operations. Gardner Denver measures Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures. Gardner Denver believes Free Cash Flow is a useful supplemental financial measure for management and investors in assessing the Company’s ability to pursue business opportunities and investments and to service its debt. Free Cash Flow is not a measure of our liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities.\nManagement and Gardner Denver’s board of directors regularly use these measures as tools in evaluating the Company’s operating and financial performance and in establishing discretionary annual compensation. Such measures are provided in addition to, and should not be considered to be a substitute for, or superior to, the comparable measures under GAAP. In addition, Gardner Denver believes that Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS and Free Cash Flow are frequently used by investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of issuers, many of which also present Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS and Free Cash Flow when reporting their results in an effort to facilitate an understanding of their operating and financial results and liquidity.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS and Free Cash Flow should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), diluted earnings per share or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS and Free Cash Flow have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider such measures either in isolation or as substitutes for analyzing Gardner Denver’s results as reported under GAAP.\nReconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS and Free Cash Flow to their most comparable U.S. GAAP financial metrics for historical periods are presented in the tables below.\nReconciliations of non-GAAP measures related to full year 2018 guidance have not been provided due to the unreasonable efforts it would take to provide such reconciliations.\nGARDNER DENVER HOLDINGS, INC.
