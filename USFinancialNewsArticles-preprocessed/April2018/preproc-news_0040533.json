    "text": "Leonys Martin ripped his first career grand slam, and the Detroit Tigers completed a three-game series sweep while handing the Baltimore Orioles their sixth straight loss 13-8 on Thursday.\nMartin had three hits and scored three runs while Jeimer Candelario went 4-for-4, including a homer, and drove in three runs as the Tigers scored a season high in runs. Jose Iglesias had three hits, two runs scored and three RBIs.\nWinning pitcher Jordan Zimmermann (1-0) gave up four runs on seven hits with seven strikeouts over 5 1/3 innings. Zimmermann exited his last start on April 11 in the first inning after being struck in the jaw by a line drive.\nManny Machado hit a pair of solo homers and drove in four runs for Baltimore. Chris Davis supplied a two-run shot, and Adam Jones contributed three doubles.\nLosing pitcher Alex Cobb (0-2) allowed seven runs (five earned) on 10 hits in 3 1/3 innings.\nThe Tigers scored in the first on Victor Martinez’s RBI single.\nDavis hit his second homer this season to give Baltimore a short-lived 2-1 lead in the second.\nDetroit roared right back with four runs in the bottom of the inning. Iglesias knocked in the first two with a triple. Candelario’s single and Nicholas Castellanos’ fielder’s choice grounder brought in the other runs.\nMachado cut the Tigers’ advantage to 5-3 in the third with his first homer of the game.\nCandelario made it 7-3 in the fourth when, with Martin on base, he drilled his third homer over the wall in left-center.\nThe Tigers blew the game open with their five-run fifth. They loaded the bases with no outs on three consecutive singles. Dixon Machado was hit by a pitch to force in a run before Martin’s slam to right-center.\nManny Machado crushed his fifth homer of the season to left in the sixth.\nMachado’s run-scoring groundout and Adam Jones’ ground-rule double cut the Tigers’ lead to 12-6 in the seventh.\nIglesias’ RBI double in the eighth brought home Detroit’s final run. Machado and Jones had run-scoring doubles for the Orioles in the ninth.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
