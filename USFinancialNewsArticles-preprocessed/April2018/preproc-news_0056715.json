    "text": "MENLO PARK, Calif., April 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Facebook, Inc. (Nasdaq: FB) today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n\"Despite facing important challenges, our community and business are off to a strong start in 2018,\" said Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook founder and CEO. \"We are taking a broader view of our responsibility and investing to make sure our services are used for good. But we also need to keep building new tools to help people connect, strengthen our communities, and bring the world closer together.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nThree Months Ended March 31,\nYear-over-Year %\nChange\nIn millions, except percentages and per share amounts\n2018\n2017\nRevenue:\nAdvertising\n$\n11,795\n$\n7,857\n50\n%\nPayments and other fees\n171\n175\n(2)\n%\nTotal revenue\n11,966\n8,032\n49\n%\nTotal costs and expenses\n6,517\n4,705\n39\n%\nIncome from operations\n$\n5,449\n$\n3,327\n64\n%\nOperating margin\n46\n%\n41\n%\nProvision for income taxes\n$\n622\nEffective tax rate\n11\n%\nNet income\n$\n4,988\n$\n3,064\n63\n%\nDiluted Earnings per Share (EPS)\n$\n1.69\n$\n1.04\n63\n%\nFirst Quarter 2018 Operational and Other Financial Highlights\nDaily active users (DAUs) – DAUs were 1.45 billion on average for March 2018, an increase of 13% year-over-year.

Capital expenditures – Capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2018 were $2.81 billion.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives; our emphasis on user growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing safety, security, and content review efforts; competition; litigation and government inquiries; privacy and regulatory concerns; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; and our ability to manage growth and geographically-dispersed operations. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 1, 2018, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov . Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is April 25, 2018, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nWe exclude the following items from our non-GAAP financial measures:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment. We subtract purchases of property and equipment in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\nFACEBOOK, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In millions, except for per
