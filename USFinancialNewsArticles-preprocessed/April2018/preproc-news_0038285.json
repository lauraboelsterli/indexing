Saudi Arabia completed an $11 billion deal and Qatar followed with a $12 billion transaction.\nTAQA, a state-controlled oil explorer and power supplier, has received orders in excess of $8.25 billion for the planned bonds.\nInitial price guidance released earlier on Monday was in the region of 185 basis points (bps) over U.S. Treasuries for the seven-year tranche and about 240 bps over for the 12-year paper.\nIt was subsequently tightened to final guidance of 165 basis points (bps) over U.S. Treasuries for the seven-year tranche and to 210 bps over the UST benchmark for the 12-year paper. The document said the bonds are expected to price within a 5 bps range above or below those figures.\nTAQA will use the bond proceeds to refinance existing debt, a source close to the matter said.\nThe company borrowed $1.25 billion at the end of last year through a one-year bridging loan provided by a syndicate of six banks.\nProceeds from the bonds are expected to refinance that loan and, potentially, an outstanding $500 million bond due in September, the source said.\nCitigroup, First Abu Dhabi Bank, HSBC, ING, Mizuho, Scotiabank and SMBC Nikko are joint lead managers of TAQAâ€™s new bonds.
