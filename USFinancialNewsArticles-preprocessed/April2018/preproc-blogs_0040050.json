Relatively straightforward, as no knowledge of pop culture or sports was required.\n\nCRAIG BIRKER subscriber 5pts \nOn shore! Fun meta! (Heidi)\n\nCynthia Weatherman subscriber 5pts \nThe mgwcc is one cool construction.\nDiana Breithaupt user 5pts \nStill at sea. My latest excuse is that I just did the grid this morning, which is a true story. I got the first step. But then I set it aside to do the MGWCC because I wanted to be high on leaderboard. After an hour or more, I realized that was not going to happen, so I checked the leaderboard to see if it was difficult or if I was just stupid. \n\nThere were only 5 people on the leaderboard and you know who was No. 2? Our very own Muggle, Al Sisti. If you don't do the MGWCC, you don't know how difficult that is to accomplish on a Week 3. There he is - sitting pretty at No. 2. I am proud, as a fellow Muggle. \n\nStill at sea on both puzzles, though. \nRobert Stevens subscriber 5pts \n@ Diana Breithaupt I am highly confident that you will solve both metas. I am also not surprised that Al is at the top of the leaderboard. I still want a video of him solving one of these although it may take a high speed camera. I remain in awe. Al Sisti user 5pts \n@ Robert Stevens @ Diana Breithaupt You guys are way too kind. Sometimes you just fall into the right path the first time. Still nowhere near in the same league as a lot of the muggles here -- including Diana and Cindy, who are both perfect this year, and Meg, whose current streak is an amazing 75 straight!\nCynthia Weatherman subscriber 5pts \nToday completes my 52 week mgwcc streak.\nNow. I am going for a perfect 2018 record - wsj, mgwcc, mmmm and fireball. So far so good but there is a lot of year left. \nAnd you are right Al. Sometimes you just see it.\nJOHN BENNETT subscriber 5pts \nAlright - the nice weather in Montana had me on the golf course yesterday, rather than puzzling.\n\nOnshore.\n\nVery nice puzzle!\nJohn Wheeler user 5pts \nWell that was clever. Thanks Marie, uh--Mike.\nAshore\nMary Flaminio user 5pts \nOnshore? Always doubt my answers.\n\nRobert Stevens subscriber 5pts \n@ Mary Flaminio I have you as being on shore six weeks and not stuck on the ship. You should not doubt yourself\nBunny Zukowski user 5pts \nSafely onshore. Very cute.\n\nnow on to the MWCC\nGlyn Short user 5pts \nI think I've solved it, but I am not sure I'm on shore: I need to be assured...\nRobert Stevens subscriber 5pts \n@ Glyn Short If you are not sure, dig deeper. This is a no doubter\nJames Cornell subscriber 5pts \nAshore, but hoping it's the right beach. Puzzle seemed a bit too easy this week, but my answer hits all the marks and sometimes it just comes to you immediately. Usually not, though. Have a great weekend everyone!\n\nRobert Stevens subscriber 5pts \n@ James Cornell this is one of those \"no doubter\" solutions. \nRobert Stevens subscriber 5pts \nOur quick Friday noon report. We have had a lot of muggles jumping ship and 46 are currently on the warm shore with their mai tais from the tiki bar.\n\nA bunch of others are digging in the rabbit holes and are surely headed towards the shore. We are sure they will be joining us. M Lembo user 5pts \nThe correct answer is so much better than my imagined ones, which aren't that bad - they're just drawn that way? After a short swing by to say 'bye' to Isaac, I am ashore.\n\nHave a great weekend everyone.\nStu Katz user 5pts \nUnless it's classified information, could someone please enlighten me as to whether Marie Kelly is a real female person? I ask because I have seen comments from time to time (including this week) alluding to a different gender. Thanks. \n\nLisa Young user 5pts \n@ Stu Katz \"Marie Kelly\" is an anagram of \"Really Mike\", meaning Mike Shenk.\nRobert Stevens subscriber 5pts \n@ Stu Katz https://www.crosswordtournament.com/2016/constructors.htm Stu Katz user 5pts \n@ Robert Stevens @ Stu Katz This reply is to both Lisa and Robert.\n\nFirst, thanks for the quick turnaround, Lisa. I was hoping it was either the real name or a pseudonym of one of the great female puzzlers, of which (as we know) there are plenty (topped by the \"E\" in HEX). \n\n\nSecond, thanks for the link Robert. \n\n\nBy the way, immediately after posting my query, I Googled \"Marie Kelly puzzle\" and saw the answer to my question (of course). The problem I then encountered was that I couldn't delete my post or edit it despite three separate efforts.even though it was within 5 minutes of my post. Rather than trying to master the art of commenting , I will just try to be more judicious when I comment after this. \n\nRobert Stevens subscriber 5pts \n@ Stu Katz @ Robert Stevens Do not worry about posting and then regretting it. We all have done it. No harm, no foul Stu Katz user 5pts \n@ Robert Stevens @ Stu Katz Thanks for your words of comfort, Robert. Whether or not an official position, you are doubtless one of the de facto chaplains of our ship.\nPETER LEE subscriber 5pts \nFeeling a bit exasperated, as everyone sauntered to shore this week, while I feel like I have 95% for it and a pretty solid idea as to the answer but there's one piece missing for me that I would rather nail down to ensure I'm not actually deep in the wrong rabbit hole. So count me as at sea at this point but with land in sight.\nRobert Stevens subscriber 5pts \n@ PETER LEE Will do but I am sure you are on the right track. Keep digging in that rabbit hole and listen for the call of the wild Barbara Hays subscriber 5pts \nClever construction!\n\nRichard L Johnson subscriber 5pts \n(Cynthia) Solved and on shore.\n\nMary Ellen Price user 5pts \nMy husband and I traveled to our \"summer\" cottage in Michigan yesterday. I'm looking out the window at a frozen lake this morning. Very pretty, but cold. I have a lot of cleaning and unpacking to do, so I'm glad to be ashore, albeit a frozen one. Good luck, fellow muggles. \nRobert Stevens subscriber 5pts \n@ Mary Ellen Price How much ice is on the lake?\nMary Ellen Price user 5pts \n@ Robert Stevens @ Mary Ellen Price A neighbor told us the ice is about a foot deep?! I haven't personally checked that out yet, and I won't venture to walk on it, but i t looks frozen as far as I can see. The lake is about 4 miles wide and 10 miles long. There's at least 12 inches of snow on the ground, and some of the drifts are much deeper. We had to have someone plow out our lane so we could get in here. My husband's first priority is to de-winterize the hot tub. Mine was to solve the meta. :) \nCynthia Weatherman subscriber 5pts \nI am still mugless but now I have my \"Fireball Crosswords\" ball cap. Nice cap but not my style, LOL! I did put it on yesterday while still dressed from the office to surprise my husband when he came in. He was delayed and by the time he got home, I had forgotten that I was wearing it. The look on his face was priceless. I gave him the cap for putting up with my meta obsession.\nDiana Breithaupt user 5pts \n@ Cynthia Weatherman \n\nDoes your cap look like this\nCynthia Weatherman subscriber 5pts \nNo photo\nTHOMAS BURNAKIS subscriber 5pts \nOMG I GOT it, after three weeks of sniffing around rabbit holes and pulling out my hair (neat trick since I am follicularly challenged to start) this one came so easy I am almost ashamed. Please note I said almost!\n\nThis is the first time I even knew the puzzle was available on Thursday which is comforting because I was always AMAZED that so many folks could have the answer seemingly instantaneously. The only post-crosswordal remorse I have is that it is now over way too soon and I'll have to wait until Friday (well obviously Thursday) to do it again. Of course there is always the nagging feeling that I have not done it right - must be Episcopal guilt?\n\nThanks Marie for another clever puzzle. There is an association and comment I would love to make, but I am sure it would be a spoiler so I will wait until Sunday night or Monday to post it.\nRobert Stevens subscriber 5pts \n@ THOMAS BURNAKIS Thomas. Now you will be looking at your computer around 4:15 Eastern time every Thursday and printing it out. What will amaze you is how fast Al and some of the others solve it week in and week out. \n\nI suspect that there will be a bunch of comments on Monday\nCynthia Weatherman subscriber 5pts \n@ THOMAS BURNAKIS Subscribe to MGWCC and then you will have entertainment/angst from noon Friday forward.\nHoward Green subscriber 5pts \nOn shore with a bit of help from my consortium. Enjoyed it a lot, Mr. Kelly.\nFrank Ho user 5pts \nI have been keeping Isaac company for such a long time. Wait , what is this? I am on shore!\nRobert Stevens subscriber 5pts \n@ Frank Ho hopefully the start of a long run on shore patrol\nChris Kochmanski subscriber 5pts \nAshore! \nThis one came pretty fast. We had about an hour and a half before having to leave for the airport to pick up the kids. I thought, \"Well, I'll get started.\" Grid plus meta in about 50 minutes. That's close to my fastest, in about six or eight months of doing these.\nNino Mosca 5pts \nA few weeks ago, I thought I saw LOVE forming squares around the letters of ARGO, but I knew it wasn't elegant enough to be the true solution, so I did not submit it. (It turned out that what I was seeing was the four letters of the word \"enVELOpe\" forming squares around the word ARGO.)\n\nOnce again, I think I am almost there, but not quite...\n\nIt's only Thursday...\nJOSEPH MICHAEL subscriber 5pts \n@ Nino Mosca Funny, I got \"Argo\" that week as the meta without once noticing the \"envelope\" theme at all. it was the only movie title that fit all the references to Greek mythology in the grid itself. BTW, I would really like to see an actual movie made from Zelazny's Lord of Light , a magnificent novel (the book the movie-makers in Argo supposedly were turning into a movie).\nDavid Oakes user 5pts \nHardly ever get Marie's metas!\n\nBut this one fell into place almost at first glance -wading ashore with much celebration, assuming of course the answer was correct!\n\nMore certain than the Hunt for Red October of course... \nKas DeCarvalho user 5pts \n...is anyone else seeing the article, \"How the Caddyshack Revolution Upended Hollywood\" under the comments? (Complete with Bill Murray and gopher photo...) It's just making me chuckle in the context of all the \"rabbit hole\" comments...the Meta frequently makes me feel decidedly Murray-ish...in hindsight, we should have gone with a gopher theme, instead of rabbits. Oh, and I haven't started the grid yet, just a little post-printing lurking for psychic support...\nRobert Stevens subscriber 5pts \n@ Kas DeCarvalho Kas - I saw that and had the same chuckle. Good luck on the grid. It is between a 1 and 2 on your scale\nJOHN WEBBER subscriber 5pts \n18 minutes to complete the grid, thanks to the delay from 8A, which gets my personal prize for best clue of the week. Tomorrow afternoon, consideration of the meta.\n\nBill Schapiro subscriber 5pts \n@ JOHN WEBBER I would have thought your favorite clue was not 8A, but rather near 8A.\nBeth Albers user 5pts \nOn the beach! Enjoyed it!\nStephen McNeil subscriber 5pts \nOn shore. Now on to keep my (maybe first ever) three week streak alive for MGWCC.\nShow More Archives ADVERTISEMENT Close Call Of The Wild (Crossword Contest, April 20) \nFrom [USER_EMAIL] To Message SEND An error has occurred, please try again later.\nThank you\nThis article has been sent to",
