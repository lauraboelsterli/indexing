    "text": "BUDAPEST, April 8 (Reuters) - Hungary’s National Election Office said it expected to release preliminary results of Sunday’s election around 2100 GMT, later than earlier thought, as hundreds of people were still queuing to vote in Budapest.\nThe head of the office, Ilona Palffy, told private broadcaster ATV that turnout in two districts was much higher than anticipated. Voters were not allowed to join queues at polling stations after 1700 GMT, but some polling stations stayed open to allow those already in line to cast their ballots.
