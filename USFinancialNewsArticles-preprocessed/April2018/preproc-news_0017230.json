The new company brings together three market leaders, creating a comprehensive care continuum of personal care, skilled home health, and hospice care.\nThe newly combined company will serve over 63,000 patients and their families on a daily basis, employing over 31,000 caregivers across 15 states in 221 locations. The company will retain corporate headquarters in Michigan, Connecticut and Texas, and operate in service lines. G. Scott Herman, CEO of National Home Health Care, has been named Enterprise CEO; Adam Nielsen, CEO of Great Lakes Caring, has been named CEO of Home Health and Hospice; and Jeffrey Fisher, CEO of Jordan Health Services, will lead the company’s continued acquisition efforts as Chief Development Officer.\n“We are very excited about the opportunity to deliver coordinated continuum-based home care and serve patients in a holistic manner. The combined companies bring together best in class technology, market leading quality and a differentiated care model that clearly sets us apart,” said G. Scott Herman, Enterprise CEO . “As a combined entity, we are exceptionally well-positioned for long term success, particularly as healthcare moves toward population-based health management and outcomes-based performance.”\nThe combined assets of Great Lakes Caring, National Home Health, and Jordan Health Services will be leveraged to create one of the most technologically advanced platforms in the country, significantly improving clinical outcomes and enhancing the patient experience. The company’s scale and geographic reach will provide security, mobility, and career opportunities for more than 31,000 employees and caregivers. Over the course of the next few years, the company will continue to roll out continuum service offerings including personal care, skilled home healthcare, and hospice care throughout existing and new geographies.\nAdam Nielsen, CEO of Home Health and Hospice , added, “Quality remains central to the care we provide to the patients we serve, as we seek to provide care at the right time in the right place. With market-leading care in the Northeast, Midwest, and Southwest, the combined company will serve as one of the country’s largest home healthcare employers, enhancing our opportunities to reinvest into the careers of our employees.”\n“For over four decades, Jordan has established a track record of success and this tradition of excellence will continue as the company embarks on this exciting new chapter, which will increase our national footprint and improve care for patients nationwide,” said Jeffrey Fisher, Chief Development Officer.\nThe transaction also brings together two leading private equity partners who are committed to retaining and enhancing the culture of quality care at the companies.
