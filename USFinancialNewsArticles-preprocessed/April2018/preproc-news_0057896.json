Analysts had forecast a 3.2 billion crown profit.\nHygiene products have strong long-term growth prospect because of ageing populations and growing emerging market wealth, but Essity’s listing last year coincided with rising pulp prices, while competition has intensified, making it harder to pass on costs to customers.\nChief Executive Magnus Groth in January warned of much higher raw material costs in the first quarter for the Professional Hygiene and Consumer Tissue divisions. He predicted positive impacts from pushing through higher prices to customers from the second quarter onwards.\nThe company said higher pulp costs shaved 755 million crowns off first-quarter profit but price increases in Consumer Tissue’s Asian markets and in Professional Hygiene partly offset the cost.\n“Price increases were also carried out in Consumer Tissue in Europe during the quarter, which have yet to impact earnings,”\nthe company said.\nIts shares rose 2.8 percent at 0738 GMT. Year-to-date the shares are down 5.4 percent.\nEssity, which also makes baby diapers and feminine care products, managed to step up the pace of organic growth versus the fourth quarter to 3.4 percent, just above its target.\nKleenex producer Kimberly-Clark Corp this week reported better-than-expected quarterly profits helped by strong growth in tissue sales.\nProcter & Gamble Co narrowly beat profit expectations, saying however that commodity prices squeezed margins.\n$1 = 8.6613 Swedish crowns Reporting by Anna Ringstrom.
