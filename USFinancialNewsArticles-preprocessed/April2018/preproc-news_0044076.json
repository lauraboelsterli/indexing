FILE PHOTO: Eugene Kaspersky, Chief Executive of Russia's Kaspersky Lab, looks on during an interview with Reuters in Moscow, Russia October 27, 2017. REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov/File Photo \n“This decision is based on our determination that Kaspersky Lab operates using a business model that inherently conflicts with acceptable Twitter Ads business practices,” Twitter said in a statement emailed to Reuters.
