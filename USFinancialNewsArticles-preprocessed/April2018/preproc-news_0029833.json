    "text": "April 16, 2018 / 3:33 PM / Updated an hour ago British facial verification tech firm secures U.S. border contract Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - A British technology firm has been awarded a contract by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to use biometric facial verification technology to improve border control, the first foreign firm to win such a contract in the United States. \nLondon-based iProov will develop technology to improve border controls at unmanned ports of entry with a verification system that uses the traveller’s cell phone. \nBritish trade minister Liam Fox said in a statement on Monday that the contract was “one example of our shared economic and security ties” with the United States. \nIProov said it was the first non-U.S. firm to be awarded a contract under the Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP), which is run by the DHS Science and Technology Directorate.
