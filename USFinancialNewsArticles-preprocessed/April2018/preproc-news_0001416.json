    "text": "DUBAI (Reuters) - Investment Corporation of Dubai (ICD), the Dubai governmentâ€™s main investment arm, has raised a $1.2 billion loan needed to refinance existing debt, banking sources said.\nThe loan was led by Citi ( C.N ), Dubai Islamic Bank DISB.DU, Emirates NBD ENBD.DU, HSBC ( HSBA.L ), ICBC ( 601398.SS ) and Standard Chartered ( STAN.L ).\nThe Dubai sovereign wealth fund, whose portfolio includes stakes in companies such as Emirates Airline EMIRA.UL and Emirates NBD, had assets totaling 786.8 billion dirham ($214.21 billion) as of June last year, according to its most recent financial results.\nICD did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new loan.\nThe debt facility was syndicated to a larger group of banks and the fundraising has recently been completed, the sources said.\nIt partly refinances a $2.55 billion five-year loan ICD raised in 2013. That loan, which included an Islamic tranche, saw the participation of a group of banks including Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank, Citigroup, Commercial Bank of Dubai, Emirates NBD, HSBC and Standard Chartered.\nReporting by Davide Barbuscia; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ",
