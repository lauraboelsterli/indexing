The Senior Notes will be issued under the same indenture as the $525 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 8.50% Senior Notes due 2020 previously issued (the “Existing 8.50% Senior Notes”). The Senior Notes will have identical terms, other than the issue date, the issue price and the first interest payment date, and will constitute part of the same series as the Existing 8.50% Senior Notes. The Company intends to launch an exchange offer for the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes will be general unsecured obligations of the Company and guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company’s existing subsidiaries.\nResolute intends to use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to repay the borrowings currently outstanding under its senior credit facility. The remainder of the net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures related to the Company’s previously announced 2018 plan.\nThe Senior Notes and the related guarantees will be offered only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on the exemption from registration set forth in Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in reliance on the exemption from registration set forth in Regulation S under the Securities Act.
