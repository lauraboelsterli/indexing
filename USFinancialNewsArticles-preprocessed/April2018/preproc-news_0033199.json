    "text": "SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Anglo American Plc said on Monday it was giving 30 daysâ€™ leave to 766 workers at its suspended Minas-Rio mine in Brazil as of Tuesday.\nThe company halted production and transport operations for 90 days at the mine at the start of April to comply with a request by authorities that it inspect a pipeline that has leaked twice.\nAnglo froze operations at the mine in Minas Gerais state after the second leak was discovered on March 29, in a pipeline which carries iron ore in slurry to an export terminal in coastal Rio de Janeiro.\nAnother leak in a different section of the same pipeline prompted Anglo to suspend operations at the mine from March 12-27, raising fresh questions about mining oversight in Brazil.\nThe company said essential security activities would be maintained at Minas-Rio, from where 98 employees have been transferred to a nickel mine in Goias state.\nReporting by Anthony Boadle, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ",
