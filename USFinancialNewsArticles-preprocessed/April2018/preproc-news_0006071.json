While serving in that role, she drafted the preliminary policies and procedures of CAEP and provided overall administration for all accreditation operations.\nPrior to her work at CAEP, Dr. Eldridge was engaged in teacher preparation as a professor of literacy education, department chair of Curriculum and Instruction at Hunter College and Montclair State University, an Associate Dean responsible for accreditation at Hunter College, and then Dean of Education at Lehman College of the City University of New York. She was the primary author of two Teacher Quality Partnership grants/awards from the United States Department of Education: one for Lehman College and one for the American Museum of Natural History. Dr. Eldridge is a nationally recognized presenter on accreditation, and is the author of numerous books and articles on teacher preparation and accreditation.\nWGU's Teachers College, the first fully online teachers college to earn NCATE accreditation for its programs leading to teacher licensure, offers bachelor's, post-baccalaureate, and master's degrees for aspiring and already-licensed teachers and K–12 leaders. Established in 2003 with the support of the U.S. Department of Education, WGU's Teachers College is a leader in STEM education and a top producer of math and science teachers throughout the nation. The National Council on Teacher Quality (NCTQ) ranked WGU's secondary math education program in the nation's top one percent and the National Science Teachers Association nationally recognized WGU's eight science programs.\nAbout WGU\nEstablished in 1997 by 19 U.S. governors with a mission to expand access to high-quality, affordable higher education, online, nonprofit WGU now serves 95,000 students nationwide and has 103,000 graduates in all 50 states.
