    "text": "April 18, 2018 / 6:25 AM / Updated 24 minutes ago Australia shares end up on miners; NZ rises Reuters Staff \n* Aussie shares close at highest since March 22 \n* Miners lead, banks cap gains \n* NZ up on dairy, industrial boost (Updates to close) \nApril 18 (Reuters) - Australian shares rose 0.3 percent on Wednesday, buoyed by mining shares, but gains were capped by losses in banking and healthcare stocks. \nRobust earnings on Wall Street in what is expected to be the strongest earnings season in seven years also provided the regional market with a confidence boost. \nThe S&P/ASX 200 index rose 19.9 points to 5,861.4, its highest close since March 22. The benchmark was flat on Tuesday. \nMiner South32 Ltd was the top boost to the index, up 2.5 percent. \nIron ore and steel prices in China rallied following a surprise cut in banksâ€™ reserve requirements on Tuesday, and as mounting worries over tighter supply following U.S. sanctions on key producer Rusal pushed London aluminium futures to their strongest level since 2011. \nSteel manufacturer BlueScope Steel climbed 4.1 percent, while global miner Rio Tinto rose 1.1 percent after reporting a rise in first-quarter iron ore shipments. \nWoodside Petroleum climbed 1.1 percent after it said increased output and higher liquefied natural gas prices drove up first-quarter revenue 30 percent. \nGaming machine maker Aristocrat Leisure rose 2.5 percent. \nFinancials and large-cap healthcare stocks fell, however. \nCommonwealth Bank of Australia slipped 0.5 percent, while healthcare giant CSL Ltd fell 0.7 percent. \nCBA said on Tuesday it plans to list its investment management business this year, at a time when lenders are being investigated by a powerful judicial inquiry and face scrutiny from authorities. \nAustralian Treasurer Scott Morrison warned on Wednesday that financial sector executives responsible for widespread breaches of corporate law could face jail. \nIn New Zealand, the benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index rose 0.3 percent or 24.97 points to 8,369.49. \nDairy firm a2 Milk Company rose 1.3 percent, while Auckland International Airport was up 1.2 percent. \nFisher & Paykel Healthcare Corporation fell 1.4 percent lower to its lowest close since mid-Sept.
