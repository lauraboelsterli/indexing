(AP) _ TriCo Bancshares (TCBK) on Thursday reported first-quarter profit of $13.9 million.\nThe bank, based in Chico, California, said it had earnings of 60 cents per share. Earnings, adjusted for costs related to mergers and acquisitions, were 62 cents per share.\nThe results did not meet Wall Street expectations.
