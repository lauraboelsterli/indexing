BNSF Railway and Union Pacific Corp. UNP 2.43% are offering signing bonuses of up to $25,000 to prospective workers, highlighting how strong shipping demand and a tight labor market are triggering wage pressures at freight operators . The “hiring incentives” vary by location and job, the WSJ’s Paul Ziobro reports, and analysts and union leaders say the bonuses are the highest they can recall. BNSF says the railroad is facing a talent shortage across its system and is extending the offer to diesel mechanics, electricians and conductor trainees. Those can be demanding jobs, with irregular schedules, long hours and frequent nights away from home—a tough sell with the national unemployment rate at 4.1%, and as low as 2.8% in some markets where railroads are hiring.\nA new bid aims to rescue Sears Holdings Corp. SHLD -3.01% by turning some of its signature business lines into suppliers for the rest of the retail world. Under a new plan, Sears Chief Executive Edward Lampert would buy the Sears Parts Direct and home-improvement segments through his hedge fund and would submit a proposal to buy the Kenmore appliance operation . The moves are meant to inject cash into the business and stave off bankruptcy, the WSJ’s Suzanne Kapner and Allison Prang report, but they would also carve up of the business and give shoppers less reason to buy directly from the retailer. Sears suppliers have grown increasingly concerned about the company, forcing Sears to pay cash upfront for many goods. Sears remains a top appliance seller, but so far it looks like no one other than Mr. Lampert wants to buy the whole Kenmore line.\nThe retail industry’s woes are weighing heavily on toy suppliers. Hasbro Inc. blamed a 16% decline in first-quarter sales on the liquidation of Toys “R” Us Inc., and that has the company speeding up its drive to take more control of its business onlin e. The WSJ’s Paul Ziobro reports Hasbro is laying off executives in commercial operations and bringing in people with more expertise in e-commerce. Hasbro already was viewed as a leader in adapting to the new marketplace, and it looks like the company sees bigger changes coming even as other retailers press for more of the Transformers and My Little Pony dolls that Hasbro distributes. Hasbro says some retailers are considering expanding their toy sections to help fill the Toys “R” Us gap. But Hasbro’s moves suggest the company isn’t willing to wait for those companies to decide.\nLOGISTICS TECHNOLOGY Photo: Bloomberg News Some of the world’s heavyweight technology investors are getting behind freight load-matching technology in China. Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Capital G late-stage venture fund are among investors plowing close to $2 billion into the Chinese truck-hailing company Manbang Group. The WSJ’s Julie Steinberg and Liza Lin write that Manbang, also known as Full Truck Alliance, runs a mobile app platform that matches truck drivers with shippers looking to transport cargo. Previous backers have included internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. and a private-equity firm co-founded by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma. The backing highlights the big interest in China’s growing logistics industry, where a highly fragmented trucking business makes load-matching services especially valuable. And the international reach of the investor list raises the potential for the company’s technology to reach well beyond China.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ The balance of power in toy retail is shifting toward Amazon and the dot-coms. ’\n—Stephanie Wissink, Jefferies toy analyst.\nNumber of the Day 5.4% Year-over-year increase in average rental rate for warehouse space in the U.S. per square foot in the first quarter, according to Cushman & Wakefield.\nIN OTHER NEWS XPO Logistics Inc. hired a former Amazon.com Inc. executive Kenneth Wagers as its chief operating officer .
