    "text": "Full Year Net Earnings Including Non-Controlling Interests of $46 million; Adjusted EBITDA of $478 million\nAnnounces Pursuing Sale of Its Shop ‘n Save and Shop ‘n Save East Retail Operations\nAnnounces Sale Leaseback Transactions for Eight Distribution Centers\nIntroduces Fiscal 2019 Outlook\nMINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- SUPERVALU INC. (NYSE: SVU) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 24, 2018 and provided updates regarding ongoing efforts to optimize its retail operations and monetize select real estate assets through sale leaseback transactions.\nFull Year Fiscal 2018 Financial Summary (Compared to Fiscal 2017):\nContinuing operations Consolidated net sales increased $3.25 billion, or 30%; including $2.6 billion from Unified Grocers and AG Florida Wholesale net sales increased $3.35 billion, or 43% Total Net earnings attributable to SUPERVALU INC. Net earnings including non-controlling interests of $46 million, comprised of $49 million of Net earnings from continuing operations and $3 million of Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax Adjusted EBITDA of $478 million, comprised of $436 million of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and $42 million from discontinued operations\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Financial Summary (Compared to Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2017):\nContinuing operations Consolidated net sales increased $1.07 billion, or 42%; including $970 million from Unified Grocers and AG Florida Wholesale net sales increased by $1.08 billion, or 60% Total Net earnings attributable to SUPERVALU INC. Net earnings including non-controlling interests of $33 million, comprised of $25 million of Net earnings from continuing operations and $8 million of Income from discontinued operations, net of tax Adjusted EBITDA of $128 million, comprised of $117 million of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and $11 million from discontinued operations\nOperational Updates\nIn a separate press release today, Supervalu announced it has entered into definitive agreements to sell eight of its owned distribution centers, representing approximately 5.8 million square feet, to a single buyer for an aggregate purchase price, excluding closing costs and taxes, of approximately $483 million (net proceeds estimated to be $445 million). Subject to customary closing conditions, the sale and leaseback for seven of the properties is expected to be completed in May, and by October for one property. Supervalu today announced it is pursuing the sale of its corporately owned and operated Shop ‘n Save (based in St. Louis) and Shop ‘n Save East (with stores in West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia) retail operations.\n“We finished fiscal 2018 strong with results in-line with our expectations after having made significant progress throughout the year with our ongoing wholesale business transformation. We’re pleased with our efforts to date to create a stronger company with more focused operations through the purchase of Unified Grocers and AG Florida,” said President and CEO Mark Gross.\n“Already in the first two months of fiscal 2019, we’ve capitalized on our business momentum by taking several decisive, strategic actions that further our transformation,” Gross continued. “These include exiting our Farm Fresh banner, the announcement that we’re pursuing the sale of our Shop ‘n Save and Shop ‘n Save East retail operations, and the monetization of approximately $483 million in owned real estate. With a growing Wholesale business and more stable group of retail stores, we believe SUPERVALU is well positioned for success. While we still have more work to do, we remain optimistic about our ability to grow our core Wholesale business and create long-term shareholder value.”\nFourth Quarter Results - Continuing Operations\nFourth quarter net sales were $3.59 billion compared to $2.53 billion for the fourth quarter last year, an increase of $1.07 billion or 42 percent. Total net sales within the Wholesale segment increased 60 percent. Retail identical store sales were positive 0.1 percent. Fees earned under services agreements in the fourth quarter were $32 million compared to $42 million for the fourth quarter last year.\nGross profit for the fourth quarter was $356 million or 9.9 percent of net sales. Last year’s fourth quarter gross profit was $338 million, or 13.4 percent of net sales. The gross profit rate decrease compared to last year is primarily due to the change in business segment mix, with Wholesale representing a larger portion of total sales and gross profit, and the contribution from Unified Grocers at a lower gross profit rate.\nSelling and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were $288 million, or 8.0 percent of net sales, including certain adjustments that offset one another. Selling and administrative expenses in last year’s fourth quarter were $273 million and included a $1 million pension settlement charge and $1 million of store closure charges and costs. When adjusted for these items, last year’s fourth quarter selling and administrative expenses were $271 million, or 10.7 percent of net sales. The decrease in the adjusted selling and administrative expense rate compared to last year was primarily driven by the change in business segment mix toward Wholesale partially offset by higher employee-related costs.\nNet interest expense for the fourth quarter was $31 million, compared to $40 million in last year’s fourth quarter which included $12 million of unamortized financing charges. When adjusted for this item, last year’s fourth quarter interest expense was $28 million. The increase in adjusted net interest expense was driven by higher average outstanding debt balances following the purchase of Unified Grocers and AG Florida.\nIncome tax expense in the fourth quarter was $26 million and included a $31 million non-cash charge to reduce the carrying value of net deferred tax assets resulting from the newly enacted tax reform legislation as well as a $22 million credit related to an adjustment to the valuation allowance associated with Supervalu’s capital loss carry-forward. Last year’s fourth quarter tax expense was $3 million.\nWholesale\nFourth quarter Wholesale net sales were $2.87 billion, compared to $1.79 billion for the fourth quarter last year, an increase of 60 percent. The net sales increase is primarily due to sales from the acquired Unified Grocers and Associated Grocers of Florida businesses, sales to new customers and increased sales to new stores operated by existing customers, partially offset by stores no longer operated by customers and lower military sales.\nWholesale operating earnings in the fourth quarter were $68 million and included $5 million in legal settlement income, offset in part by $4 million of severance costs. When adjusted for these items, fourth quarter Wholesale operating earnings were $67 million, or 2.3 percent of net sales. Last year’s fourth quarter Wholesale operating earnings were $60 million, or 3.4 percent of net sales. The decrease in adjusted Wholesale operating earnings, as a percent of net sales, was driven by the mix impact from the inclusion of the acquired Unified Grocers business, which contributed to operating earnings at a lower percent of net sales. Operational cost synergies are expected to increase operating earnings as a percent of net sales in future periods.\nRetail\nFourth quarter Retail net sales were $690 million, compared to $694 million for the fourth quarter last year, a decrease of 0.6 percent. Identical store sales were positive 0.1 percent, but were more than offset by the lost sales from closed stores.\nRetail operating earnings in the fourth quarter were $1 million, or 0.1 percent of net sales. Last year’s fourth quarter Retail operating earnings were $10 million and included $1 million of store closure charges and costs. When adjusted for this item, last year’s Retail operating earnings were $11 million, or 1.4 percent of net sales. The decrease in adjusted Retail operating earnings, as a percent of net sales, was primarily driven by higher shrink costs and lower base margins to drive customer traffic.\nCorporate\nFourth quarter fees earned under services agreements were $32 million compared to $42 million last year.\nNet Corporate operating loss in the fourth quarter was $1 million, and included $5 million of merger and integration costs, $3 million of store closure charges and costs and $2 million of severance costs, offset in part by an $8 million benefit plan termination gain and a gain on sale of property of $1 million. When adjusted for these items, net Corporate operating earnings were $0 million. Last year’s fourth quarter net Corporate operating loss was $5 million and included a $1 million pension settlement charge. When adjusted for this item, last year’s net Corporate operating loss was $4 million.\nDiscontinued Operations\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the results of operations, financial position and cash flows related to the corporately owned retail operations of Farm Fresh, Shop ‘n Save and Shop ‘n Save East moved to discontinued operations for all historical periods. Fiscal 2017 included a $577 million after-tax gain on the sale of Save-A-Lot, recorded in (Loss) income from discontinued operations, net of tax.\nCash Flows - Continuing Operations\nFiscal 2018 net cash flows provided by operating activities of continuing operations were $139 million compared to $233 million last year, primarily reflecting higher levels of cash utilized toward operating assets and liabilities. Fiscal 2018 net cash flows used in investing activities of continuing operations were $494 million compared to $149 million last year, reflecting the purchase of Unified Grocers, AG Florida, and two distribution centers. Fiscal 2018 net cash flows provided by financing activities of continuing operations were $88 million, compared to net cash flows used in financing activities of continuing operations of $1,107 million last year, primarily reflecting borrowings to finance business acquisitions this year compared to debt payments made last year as a result of selling Save-A-Lot.\nFiscal 2019 Outlook for Continuing Operations\nFiscal 2019 consolidated net sales are expected to be within a range of $15.5 billion to $15.7 billion. Retail ID sales are expected to be flat to slightly positive.\nAs part of Supervalu’s fiscal 2019 planning process, Supervalu determined it would revise its definition of Adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2019 to exclude the non-service components related to net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit income that it will be required to move below operating earnings, given recent changes to accounting rules, and has also revised the definition to exclude stock-based compensation. Fiscal 2018 Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $436 million would have been $399 million under this revised definition after subtracting $44 million in pension income and $12 million in OPEB (other post-employment benefits) income, and adding $19 million in stock compensation expense.\nSupervalu expects net earnings from continuing operations to be in the range of $55 million to $73 million. Under the revised definition of Adjusted EBITDA from the prior paragraph, Fiscal 2019 Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $375 million to $400 million, including $27 million in rent expense associated with the announced sale leaseback transaction expected to generate approximately $445 million in net proceeds. A reconciliation of projected net earnings from continuing operations to projected Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, and certain factors affecting the range of expected earnings from continuing operations, is presented in Table 8.\nConference Call ­­­\nA conference call to review the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2018 results is scheduled for 3:30 p.m. central time today.

(2) The application of continuing operations accounting presentation requires Supervalu to present lease expense based on the legal entities that have the contracts with the landlords, regardless of these locations being held for sale. This lease expense is attributable to held-for-sale retail stores for which Supervalu is pursuing sale agreements where Supervalu will not be selling the legal entities that are party to these contracts. This lease expense is primarily related to two retail banners for which Supervalu is likely to pursue sale agreements in which the leases would be assigned. Upon reaching agreements to sell these retail stores, Supervalu anticipates that lease payments will be paid directly by the acquirer, and Supervalu will no longer incur the expense.

(2) This adjustment reflects (1) the fees that Supervalu expects to recognize in connection with performing services for Save-A-Lot under the services agreement entered into with Save-A-Lot on December 5, 2016 (the “Services Agreement”) and (2) Wholesale distribution sales to Save-A-Lot pursuant to a customer agreement between Supervalu and Save-A-Lot that had historically been intercompany sales. Actual Services Agreement fees are subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms of the Services Agreement, including for changes in service levels. This adjustment only applies to time periods prior to the sale of Save-A-Lot on December 5, 2016. (3) This adjustment reflects the Cost of sales related to Wholesale’s distribution to Save-A-Lot, which was previously eliminated on an intercompany basis. No adjustment for expenses related to the Services Agreement has been included within Cost of sales because the shared service center costs incurred to support back office functions related to the Services Agreement represent administrative overhead costs that have been included within Selling and administrative expenses within Supervalu’s historical consolidated financial statements.

Fiscal 2019 Outlook\nThe following table reconciles Supervalu’s outlook for full year fiscal 2019 Adjusted EBITDA, as revised for fiscal 2019 definition changes, to Net earnings from continuing operations, the most comparable GAAP measure. The table below illustrates the expected changes to management’s definition of Adjusted EBITDA. Finally, the outlook below includes the expected $27 million of (pre-tax) rent expense associated with the sale leaseback announced on April 24, 2018. Additional adjustments not related to our on-going business performance may also arise during fiscal 2019.\nTable 8 For the Fiscal Year Ending February 23, 2019 (52 weeks) Projected Low End Projected High (In millions) Amount End Amount Results of operations, as projected Net earnings from continuing operations $ 55 $ 73 Income tax provision 18 24 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates (1 ) (1 ) Net pension and other postretirement benefit income (1) (38 ) (38 ) Interest expense, net 113 113 Total operating earnings (1) $ 147 $ 171 Add Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 1 1 Less net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (1 ) (1 ) Depreciation and amortization 180 180 LIFO charge 3 3 Merger and integration costs 20 20 Net pension and other postretirement benefit income (1) 38 38 Adjusted EBITDA, as historically defined $ 388 $ 413 Fiscal 2019 Adjusted EBITDA definition (1) Net pension and other postretirement benefit income (1) (38 ) (38 ) Stock-based compensation (1) 25 25 Adjusted EBITDA, as revised for fiscal 2019 definition changes $ 375 $ 400 (1) Accounting standard update 2017-07 requires entities to present non-service components of net periodic pension and other post retirement benefit income in a new financial statement line below operating earnings. Supervalu is required to adopt this accounting standard in its first quarter of fiscal 2019. As a result of this required change, Supervalu determined it would reduce its measure of Adjusted EBITDA by the effect of the financial statement line item change, which will negatively impact the measure of Adjusted EBITDA, as historically defined. Upon considering this accounting standard change and as part of Supervalu’s fiscal 2019 planning process, Supervalu determined it would revise its definition of Adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2019 to exclude the non-service components related to net periodic pension and other post retirement benefit income that it will be required to move below operating earnings and has also revised the definition to exclude stock-based compensation. Management is providing an outlook for fiscal 2019 Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, because management believes Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of business performance that provides investors with useful supplemental information. Supervalu utilizes non-GAAP measures to analyze underlying core business trends to understand operating performance and as a compensation performance measure.\n //www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180424006358/en/\nSUPERVALU INC.\nInvestor Contact\nSteve Bloomquist, 952-828-4144\nsteve.j.bloomquist@supervalu.com\nor\nMedia Contact\nJeff Swanson, 952-903-1645\njeffrey.s.swanson@supervalu.com\nSource: SUPERVALU INC.",
