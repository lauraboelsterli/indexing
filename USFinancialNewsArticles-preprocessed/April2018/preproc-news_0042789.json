    "text": "WARSAW, April 19 (Reuters) - Polish telecoms operator Play Communications said its Chief Executive Jorgen Bang-Jensen has resigned and will be replaced by Jean-Marc Harion, a former manager at Orange.\nBang-Jensen, who has been CEO since 2009, will stay on until Harion takes over on Aug. 1, Play said in a statement late on Wednesday without giving a reason for Bang-Jensen’s departure.\n“Bang-Jensen will remain a significant shareholder in the company and will be available in a senior advisory capacity to Play,” Play said.\nPlay, which listed on the Warsaw stock exchange last year, is Poland’s biggest telecom company in terms of number of subscribers.\nHarion most recently served as chief executive of Orange Egypt and Mobistar, and previously as CEO of Orange Dominikana and Orange VP Business Development Americas, Play said.
