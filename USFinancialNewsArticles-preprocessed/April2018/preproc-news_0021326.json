FILE PHOTO: Jan 17, 2018; Brooklyn, NY, USA; San Antonio Spurs point guard Tony Parker (9) controls the ball against Brooklyn Nets shooting guard Allen Crabbe (33) during the third quarter at Barclays Center. Brad Penner-USA TODAY Sports \nAll 16 teams competing in the playoffs will have at least one international player while the Utah Jazz and Philadelphia 76ers lead the way with seven foreign born players on each roster. \nThe Boston Celtics, Toronto Raptors and San Antonio Spurs each have six. \nNBA fans in France and Australia will have more reason to follow the postseason than others with seven players from each country on squad lists, followed by Canada and Spain with four. \nFrenchman Tony Parker, a four-time champion with the San Antonio Spurs will be making his 17th straight playoff appearance, the longest active streak among all NBA players. \nThe NBA playoffs begin on Saturday with the Golden State Warriors opening the defense of their crown against the Spurs. \nThe league also said it had set all-time records for total attendance (22,124,559), average attendance (17,987) and sellouts (741) during the 2017-18 season.
