    "text": "BANGKOK (Reuters) - Prosecutors said on Wednesday they are seeking to indict the president of Thailand’s largest construction company for poaching wildlife, a case that has raised concern about impunity for the rich and powerful.\nPremchai Karnasuta, president of Italian-Thai Development Pcl, and three others were arrested in the Thungyai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary in Kanchanaburi province in early February.\nSeveral carcasses of protected animals including a black Indochinese leopard were found near their jungle campsite.\nPremchai originally faced 11 charges filed by police in February.\nBut public prosecutors said on Wednesday they had dropped some and he now faced six including hunting protected species, hunting in a sanctuary, possessing carcasses of protected animals and hiding illegally obtained carcasses, they said.\nPremchai and the three accomplices could face jail and hefty fines if found guilty.\nPremchai was not available for comment.\nHe has said little in public about the case but told reporters soon after his arrest that he had been on holiday in the sanctuary. He later said he believed he was innocent.\nHis lawyer, Withoon Yamprai, declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.\n“I have not received all of the information,” Withoon said.\nThe case has attracted extensive media coverage and suspicion among environmental activists that Premchai would not be properly investigated because of his status and wealth.\nDemocracy activists have posted images of a black leopard on social media, and it has even been daubed on walls, to draw attention to what they see as unfair privilege in society.\nThailand has a poor record in protecting its forests and wildlife from illegal exploitation, environmentalists say.\nProsecutors said their indictment request had been forwarded to police and it would proceed to a provincial court if there were no objections.\nThe attorney-general will make a final decision on the case if police object.\nReporting by Patpicha Tanakasempipat and Panarat Thepgumpanat Additional reporting by Chayut Setboonsarng; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ",
