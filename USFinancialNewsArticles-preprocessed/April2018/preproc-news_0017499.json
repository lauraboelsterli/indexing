During a La Niña year, winter temperatures are warmer than normal in the Southeast United States and cooler than normal in the Northwest, according to the U.S. National Ocean Service.\nThe Southwest typically sees drought conditions during a La Niña cycle as a high-pressure ridge prevents storms moving west from the Pacific to the states of New Mexico and Arizona.\nReporting by Vijaykumar Vedala and Arpan Varghese in Bengaluru Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and David Gregorio\n ",
