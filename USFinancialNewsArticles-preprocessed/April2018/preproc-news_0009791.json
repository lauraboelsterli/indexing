    "text": "0 COMMENTS U.S. government bonds strengthened Friday as investors reacted to a mixed U.S. jobs report and a new tariff threat from the Trump administration.\nIn recent trading, the yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was 2.810%, according to Tradeweb, compared with 2.819% just before the jobs report and 2.830% Thursday.\nYields, which fall when prices rise, ticked slightly lower after the Labor Department said the U.S. added 103,000 jobs in March, below the 178,000 gain anticipated by economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. Average hourly earnings for private-sector workers rose 2.7% from a year earlier, broadly in line with analysts’ expectations and the moderate pace of wage gains so far this year.\nBond investors have been closely following data on wages because a pickup in workers’ pay could lead to broader inflation, a main threat to government bonds because it chips away the purchasing power of their fixed returns and can lead the Federal Reserve to quicken the pace of its interest-rate increases.\nThe jobs report presented “a bit of a mixed picture” and, “as a result, the Treasurys market has not a done a great deal with the release,” said John Canavan, market analyst at Stone and McCarthy Research Associates.\nBefore the jobs report, Treasury yields had edged lower overnight President Trump said Thursday he was considering tariffs on an additional $100 billion in imports from China on top of the $50 billion that have already been formally announced. Traders often buy Treasurys during times of political or economic uncertainty because they offer steady interest-payments with essentially no credit risk.\nMr. Trump’s statement followed China’s announcement earlier this week that it would levy penalties on $50 billion of U.S. goods in response to the Trump administration’s first proposal.\nThe yield on the 10-year note is still higher than where it closed last week, reflecting confidence among investors that the U.S. and China can resolve their differences.\nWrite to Sam Goldfarb at sam.goldfarb@wsj.com",
