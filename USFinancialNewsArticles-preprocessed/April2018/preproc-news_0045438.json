    "text": "EditorsNote: adds new seventh graf; fixes time in next-to-last graf\nMatt Calvert scored 12:22 into overtime, and the Columbus Blue Jackets again rallied from an early two-goal deficit to defeat the Washington Capitals 5-4 in Game 2 of an Eastern Conference first-round series Sunday night in Washington.\nColumbus trailed 2-0 in each of the first two games yet holds a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven set.\nCalvert converted the rebound of a Zach Werenski shot from in front, on a one-handed shot that beat goalie Braden Holtby. The goal then stood up under review that checked for offside at the start of the play.\nThe series now shifts to Columbus for Game 3 on Tuesday and Game 4 on Thursday.\nWashington held a pair of two-goal leads in Game 2. The Capitals were up 2-0 in the first period and 3-1 in the second before the Blue Jackets answered with three consecutive goals.\nJosh Anderson, Cam Atkinson and Werenski all scored in a span of 10:03 in the second period for a 4-3 Columbus lead. Capitals forward T.J. Oshie tied it with 3:35 left in regulation on the fourth Washington power play of the period.\nAlex Ovechkin scored twice for the Capitals.\nWerenski had given the Blue Jackets a 4-3 lead on the power play with a wrist shot that got past goalie Philipp Grubauer. Holtby replaced Grubauer at the start of the third period, and he saved seven of the eight shots he faced.\nBlue Jackets goalie Sergei Bobrovsky stayed busy, making 54 saves as Washington outshot the Blue Jackets 58-30.\nWashington scored first when Jay Beagle, back after missing Game 1 with an upper-body injury, deflected a Brooks Orpik shot out of mid-air just 2:12 into the game.\nA goalie-interference call on Atkinson wiped out a possible game-tying goal and put Washington on a power play. The Caps then scored with a man advantage when Alex Ovechkin beat Bobrovsky at 13:26 for a quick 2-0 lead.\nAtkinson cut Columbus’ deficit to 2-1 on a breakaway with 1:35 left in the first period.\nOvechkin made it 3-1 at 4:09 of the second period — eight seconds into another power play.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
