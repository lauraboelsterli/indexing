    "text": "By Kate Duguid NEW YORK, April 20 (Reuters) - The 10-year Treasury yield reached its highest level since March 21 as a bond selloff continued for a second day, driving the yield curve steeper after two weeks of flattening. The move looks to be reflective of a structural or technical shift in the market, rather than a jump in investor confidence in the U.S. economy or rising inflation. As such, analysts, regardless of whether they expect the curve would invert in 2018, believe the current steepening is a temporary move. \"In the last few days there has been pressure (on the bond market) and I think it has to do with funding issues, a reallocation based on repatriation of dollars,\" said Lou Brien, market strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago, Illinois. \"I don't think bonds are reacting to stocks, I don't think they're reacting to heightened inflation expectations.\" President Donald Trump's administration has incentivized American companies to repatriate their cash. If a company that had been holding money abroad in the form of Treasuries did repatriate those funds, it may then use them to reinvest in the company, pay dividends, or make shorter-term investments rather than to buy Treasuries again. The 10-year Treasury yield was last at 2.940 percent, a monthly high, though still below the 2.957 percent of Feb. 21, which was the highest level since January 2014. The increase in supply of Treasury bills, with auctions of the two-year, five-year and seven-year bonds next week, will continue to flatten the curve. Tamping down prices at the front end will be the increase at auction of two-year fixed-rate debt to $32 billion, the most sold for this maturity in four years. Supply has increased in part because the Republican government's tax bill is expected to add $1.5 trillion to the federal debt load. In addition, the Fed is winding down the amount of debt it buys, ending its crisis-era policy. Together, the tax bill and the Fed's updated balance sheet added significantly to the amount of debt the United States must sell in 2018. Because of that increased supply, even analysts who do not believe the yield cure will invert this year, do not necessarily think it will continue to steepen. \"We don't feel that this yield curve flattening is a precursor to a recession,\" said Eric Souza, senior portfolio manager at Silicon Valley Bank in San Francisco, California. But, he admitted, the yield curve is likely to continue to flatten. \"In a normal rising rate environment you would have a flat yield curve. We saw this recently in the 2004-2006 time frame,\" he said. The two-year Treasury yield was last at 2.453 percent, above its last close. The 30-year Treasury yield was last at 3.129, also above its close on Thursday.
