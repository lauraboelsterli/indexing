    "text": "AKRON, Ohio, April 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE) today announced it has reached an agreement in principle with two groups of key creditors in the Chapter 11 proceedings of FirstEnergy Solutions (FES), its related entities and FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Company (FENOC) on a proposed settlement of all potential claims among FE, FES and the creditor groups. Collectively, the creditors in this agreement represent a majority of the outstanding unsecured and secured debt obligations of FES and its related entities, including the majority of Bruce Mansfield certificate holders.\nOn March 31, 2018, FES, its subsidiaries and FENOC made voluntary Chapter 11 filings under the United States Bankruptcy Code. FirstEnergy and its distribution, transmission, regulated generation and Allegheny Energy Supply (AE Supply) subsidiaries were not part of the filing.\nThis agreement in principle is a significant step toward FES, its related entities, and FENOC ultimately emerging from bankruptcy. The settlement is intended to fully release FirstEnergy and related parties from all claims. It provides FES, its subsidiaries, and FENOC with assistance from FirstEnergy on key business matters during the restructuring process. The agreement also affirms FirstEnergy's previously announced guarantees and assurances of certain FES employee-related obligations, which include unfunded pension obligations and other employee benefits, and provides for the waiver of certain inter-company claims held by FirstEnergy.\nThe agreement is subject to approval by the FirstEnergy and AE Supply boards of directors, the execution of definitive agreements and certain other conditions, and – as to participation by FES, its subsidiaries and FENOC – approval by their respective boards. It also is subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court.\nThe creditor groups also agreed to use their best efforts to have the Official Committee of the Unsecured Creditors, as well as any remaining key creditors, join the settlement by June 15, 2018. The complete terms of the agreement are described in a court filing made today in the FES Chapter 11 proceedings and in a disclosure on Form 8K, which will be available at http://investors.firstenergycorp.com/IRW/Docs .\nFirstEnergy is dedicated to safety, reliability and operational excellence. Its 10 electric distribution companies form one of the nation's largest investor-owned electric systems, serving customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia, Maryland and New York. The company's transmission subsidiaries operate more than 24,000 miles of transmission lines that connect the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions.

Dividends declared from time to time on FirstEnergy Corp.'s common stock, and thereby on FirstEnergy Corp.'s preferred stock, during any period may in the aggregate vary from prior periods due to circumstances considered by FirstEnergy Corp.'s Board of Directors at the time of the actual declarations. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. These forward-looking statements are also qualified by, and should be read together with, the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC. The foregoing review of factors also should not be construed as exhaustive. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor assess the impact of any such factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise, except as required by law, any forward-looking statements contained herein as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/firstenergy-announces-agreement-in-principle-with-creditors-in-firstenergy-solutions-chapter-11-proceedings-300634325.html\nSOURCE FirstEnergy Corp.",
