    "text": "For students, college applications are one more step in the tedious process of getting into and choosing the right school . But for colleges, applications serve as something else entirely: a revenue stream.\nThat's according to LendEdu, which conducted a study to find just how much colleges and universities can make in total from application fees and specifically from denials.\nUsing 2015-2016 college admissions data, LendEDU created a list of the 500 colleges with the highest enrolled-to-admitted ratios, 500 colleges that make the most in revenue from total applications and 500 colleges that make the most from declined applications.\nHere are the top 10 schools that made the most from declined student applications, with their corresponding revenue from total applications, enrolled-to-admitted ratios and application fees:\nUniversity of California-Los Angeles Revenue from declined applications: $5,367,180\nRevenue from total applications: $6,488,300\nEnrolled-to-admitted ratio: 35 percent\nApplication fee: $70\nUniversity of California-Berkeley Revenue from declined applications: $4,590,110\nRevenue from total applications: $5,522,510\nEnrolled-to-admitted ratio: 42 percent\nApplication fee: $70\nStanford University Revenue from declined applications: $3,632,130\nRevenue from total applications: $3,824,730\nEnrolled-to-admitted ratio: 80 percent\nApplication fee: $90\nUniversity of California-San Diego Revenue from declined applications: $3,620,820\nRevenue from total applications: $5,522,510\nEnrolled-to-admitted ratio: 26 percent\nApplication fee: $70\nUniversity of Southern California Revenue from declined applications: $3,419,440\nRevenue from total applications: $4,153,920\nEnrolled-to-admitted ratio: 32 percent\nApplication fee: $80\nshow chapters These public colleges offer the best value 10:06 AM ET Thu, 11 May 2017 | 01:21 University of California-Santa Barbara Revenue from declined applications: $3,325,700\nRevenue from total applications: $4,937,520\nAdmission-to-enrollment ratio: 19 percent\nApplication fee: $70\nUniversity of California-Irvine Revenue from declined applications: $3,080,770\nRevenue from total applications: $5,024,250\nAdmission rate: 37 percent\nApplication fee: $70\nBoston University Revenue from declined applications: $2,952,800\nRevenue from total applications: $4,382,480\nAdmission rate: 25 percent\nApplication fee: $80\nColumbia University Revenue from declined applications: $2,930,205\nRevenue from total applications: $3,137,435\nEnrolled-to-admitted ratio: 63 percent\nApplication fee: $85\nUniversity of Michigan-Ann Arbor Revenue from declined applications: $2,863,950\nRevenue from total applications: $3,884,775\nEnrolled-to-admitted ratio: 45 percent\nApplication fee: $75\n\"It is important to remember, this money is revenue for the colleges, not profit,\" the study notes. \"To ensure standards and reputations are upheld, colleges must ensure each application is thoroughly reviewed by a university employee â€” and rightfully so. The colleges transfer this cost onto the prospective student through application fees.\"\nWhile revenue projections in the report are likely close to the actual revenue numbers, they may vary based on discounted and waived applications fees because of financial aid.\nStudents applying to college can use these tips to get prepared. Those already in school can use these to save money.
