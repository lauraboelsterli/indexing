    "text": "April 9 (Reuters) - Aviation advisory firm Swiss Aviation Consulting (SAC) has shown interest here in bidding for India's debt burdened state-run carrier Air India, the Economic Times newspaper Quote: d a senior aviation ministry official as saying.\nThe move, however, did not look serious and the Swiss company may only be scouting for clients, the newspaper said, citing industry experts.\nSwiss Aviation Consulting offers services including aircraft asset management and sales and consultancy services on acquisitions, according to its website.\nAir India and Swiss Aviation Consulting did not respond to emails seeking comment outside business hours.\nLast week, top Indian carrier Interglobe Aviation Ltd , owner of the IndiGo brand, said was opting out of buying Air India because the terms set by the government were unfavorable. Tata Group and Turkey’s Celebi Aviation Holdings, have expressed interest in buying some of Air India’s operations.\nThe Indian government, which fully owns money-losing flag carrier Air India, put the company on the block late last month, seeking to sell a 76 percent stake.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s cabinet gave the go-ahead last year to sell Air India after successive governments spent billions of dollars to keep it solvent, but its debt load of about $8 billion and a bloated cost structure have made a sale difficult.\nReporting by Sayantani Ghosh in Singapore and Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru Editing by Edwina Gibbs\n ",
