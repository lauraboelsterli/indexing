    "text": "STERLING, Ill., April 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- HALO, an industry leader in promotional products and employee recognition, announced a new chapter in the company's sixty-six year history with the move to new company headquarters at 1500 HALO Way in Sterling, Illinois.\nThe state-of-the-art, 157,500 square foot facility will immediately house HALO's 300-person headquarters team with workstations for 200 additional employees. The building includes a 90,000 square foot warehouse for corporate promotional and recognition programs that are currently housed in two warehouses in the Sterling-Rock Falls community. This HALO-owned building is situated on a portion of a twenty acre site and represents Phase I of what will eventually be a 280,000 square foot facility. Groundbreaking was on April 1, 2017, and the project was completed on time and on budget.\nAccording to Marc Simon, HALO CEO, \"This building was designed both for our valued employees of today, and for the employees we will be drawing to HALO for years to come. We have collaborative meeting space, a wellness room, additional training space, and the latest technology throughout the building to allow our support team to do the best job possible for our highly valued account executives and clients.\"\nSimon concluded by adding, \"We received excellent ideas from nearly every employee and incorporated many of those ideas into the building design. Our goals were to make this the most comfortable work environment possible while providing flexibility for substantial future growth. We have achieved these goals.\"\nHALO is planning a series of open houses over the next several months for employee families, local business leaders, as well as HALO's sales and support team from around the country.
