    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, April 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Summit Semiconductor, a technology company that delivers the wireless immersive sound experience with patented technology supporting the WiSA™ (Wireless Speaker and Audio) interoperability standard, appointed Michael Howse to its board of directors, effective April 4, 2018. As of April 10 th , Summit Semiconductor has eight board directors. Howse will work closely with Summit Semiconductor CEO Brett Moyer and will lead the effort to penetrate the company's growing gaming, Esports and PC accessories markets.\nHowse said, \"Gaming is now the number one form of entertainment globally, creating a significant and expanding market opportunity for quality wireless speakers. With 2.2 billion gamers worldwide, 260 million online at any time – and even more watching – gamers will be blown away with the quality and ease of deployment for WiSA enabled audio systems.”\nGaming is a large and growing market:\n$116 billion in sales was expected to be generated in 2017 by 2.2 billion gamers across the globe and projected to grow to $143 billion in 2020, according to the NewZoo 2017 Global Games Report. $696 million was expected in Esports revenues in 2017 and projected to increase to $1.5 billion by 2020, according to the NewZoo 2017 Global Games Report.\nMoyer stated, \"Competitive gaming is changing the nature of home theater and the market implications for wireless speakers are staggering. Michael has repeatedly grown emerging-growth consumer technology companies to profitability and market leadership. For example, with Bigfoot Networks, which was acquired by Qualcomm, he led the transformation from a niche hardware supplier into a major provider of Killer™ branded networking technology shipping in millions of PCs and home routers. And at 3dfx Interactive, he created the 3D phenomenon by making the Voodoo graphics brand the default standard for gamers. We believe Michael will open doors in this explosive market segment.\"\nMichael F. Howse\nHowse is Founder and General Partner of Eleven Ventures, a venture capital firm focused on the consumer technology, digital gaming and VR / AR markets. Previously, Howse served as AMD's Corporate Vice President of New Ventures where he was responsible for defining cloud GPU platforms and strategies. Prior, Howse served as CEO and President of Bigfoot Networks, the creators of the Killer™ branded game networking technology, which was acquired by Qualcomm. Howse was integral in creating the 3D graphics category for mainstream consumers while serving in senior executive roles at Creative Labs, S3 and 3dfx Interactive.\nHowse received his undergraduate degree from UCLA and completed the Executive MBA Program at Stanford University. He currently serves on the Executive Committee of the UCLA Venture Capital Fund and previously worked at U.S. Venture Partners. Howse has received numerous industry awards, including \"Marketer of the Year\" from Marketing Computers Magazine / Brandweek, PC World's \"50 Best Products of All Time\", Fierce Wireless \"Fierce 15\" as well as an Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences award for his pioneering work at Total Vision.
