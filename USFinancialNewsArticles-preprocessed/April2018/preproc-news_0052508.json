    "text": "LONDON, April 26 (Reuters) - Shire, the London-listed drugmaker targeted by Takeda Pharmaceutical, reported a 6 percent rise in first-quarter earnings on Thursday, helped by higher product sales and a lower tax rate partially offset by lower gross margins.\nThe company reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per American Depository Share of $3.86 on revenue of $3.77 billion, slightly ahead of analysts’ forecasts of $3.72 billion.\nThe rare-disease specialist said on Wednesday it was willing to recommend a sweetened $64 billion offer from Japan’s Takeda , in what would be the biggest acquisition of a drug company since 2000.\nReporting by Paul Sandle; editing by Sarah Young\n ",
