    "text": "HONOLULU (AP) â€” The Latest on a bill addressing ancestral land awarded to Hawaiian commoners during 19th century land reforms (all times local):\n12:30 p.m.\nA Hawaii Senate committee has passed a bill that would force landowners into mediation before they are allowed to file lawsuits to acquire small parcels awarded to Hawaiian commoners during mid-19th century land reforms.\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee voted unanimously Tuesday for the kuleana (COO'-leh-ah-nah) lands legislation.\nThe bill was introduced after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in late 2016 filed lawsuits to identify owners of 14 parcels interspersed within a 700-acre oceanfront estate he owns on Kauai. His lawsuits aimed to help him find the parcel owners and buy them out.\nZuckerberg withdrew as a plaintiff in the lawsuits after a public uproar.\nCritics say the so-called quiet title lawsuits are dispossessing individual Native Hawaiians of the little land still in their control.\nThe legislation now goes to the full Senate.\n5:40 a.m.\nA Hawaii Senate committee is scheduled to hear a bill that would force landowners into mediation before they are allowed to file lawsuits to acquire small parcels awarded to Hawaiian commoners during mid-19th century land reforms.\nThe bill was introduced after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in late 2016 filed lawsuits to identify owners of 14 parcels interspersed within a 700-acre oceanfront estate he owns on Kauai. His lawsuits aimed to help him find the parcel owners and buy them out.\nCritics say these so-called quiet title lawsuits are dispossessing individual Native Hawaiians of the little land still in their control.\nZuckerberg withdrew as a plaintiff in the lawsuits after a public uproar.\nThe state House passed the legislation last year. Senators haven't considered it until now.",
