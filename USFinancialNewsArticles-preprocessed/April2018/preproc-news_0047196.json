    "text": "April 23, 2018 / 10:05 AM / Updated 9 minutes ago No testimony from Cosby as defense rests in Pennsylvania sexual assault trial David DeKok 3 Min Read \nNORRISTOWN, Pa. (Reuters) - Bill Cosby’s lawyers rested their case on Monday in his retrial on sexual assault charges, with the comedian declining to testify in his own defense against a one-time friend’s accusations that he drugged and raped her in 2004. Actor and comedian Bill Cosby walks with his publicist Andrew Wyatt, during his sexual assault retrial at the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pennsylvania, U.S. April 23, 2018. REUTERS/Jessica Kourkounis \n“Do you, Mr. Cosby, want to testify?” Judge Steven O’Neill asked the entertainer best known as “America’s Dad” for his role in the 1980s TV hit “The Cosby Show.” \n“No, your honor,” Cosby said in a clear voice, seated with his lawyers in Montgomery County Courthouse outside Philadelphia. \nCosby, 80, faces three counts of aggravated indecent assault of Andrea Constand, 45, a former administrator of the Temple University women’s basketball team, at his Philadelphia home in January 2004. \nHe also declined to testify at his first trial on the same charges last year, when the deadlocked jury was unable to reach a verdict, leading prosecutors to try him again. The current trial, now in its third week, began on April 9.

REUTERS/Jessica Kourkounis \nAbout 50 women have accused Cosby of sexual assault, sometimes after drugging them, going back decades. All the accusations, apart from Constand’s, were too old to be the subject of criminal prosecution. \nCosby has denied wrongdoing, saying any sexual contact he had was consensual. \nIf convicted of all three counts, he would likely face at most 10 years in prison as a first offender under state sentencing guidelines, although Pennsylvania law allows for a maximum penalty of three consecutive 10-year sentences, a prosecution spokeswoman said.

The defense has sought to show that a consensual encounter occurred earlier than January 2004. \nDouglas Moss, an expert on aviation record keeping, said Cosby’s trips around the United States in January 2004 were accurately reflected in flight logs kept by his private jet pilot, who now suffers from dementia. \nDistrict Attorney Kevin Steele sought to show that Cosby could have used other modes of transportation to travel to Philadelphia. \nSimilarly, Rosyln Yarbrough, who handled scheduling for Cosby at the William Morris Agency, testified that his travel itineraries showed his busy schedule of appearances in January 2004 but did not account for every day of the month. \nJudge O’Neill rejected a defense request to call a private investigator as a witness to piece together flight schedules, itineraries and phone calls to show Cosby was out of town at the time he is accused of the attack at his home. \n“That’s the lawyer’s job,” O’Neill said, referring to the closing legal arguments, set for Tuesday.
