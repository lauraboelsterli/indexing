    "text": " Britain’s TSB bank is still facing problems with its digital services, its boss said on Tuesday, a day after the company apologised because some customers were unable to access their bank accounts online.\n“I’ve just resurfaced after 48 hours with my teams who have been working as hard and fast as they can to get our services back up and running,” CEO Paul Pester said on Twitter.\nPester said TSB needed to take its mobile application and online banking down for a “few hours” to resolve the issue.\nThese services would be back online later on Tuesday afternoon, he added.\n“Customers can rest assured that no one will be left out of pocket as a result of these service issues,” Pester said.\nNicky Morgan, chair of parliament’s influential Treasury Select Committee, however, said “warm words and platitudes will not suffice.”\n“TSB customers deserve to know what has happened, when normal services will resume, and how they can expect to be compensated ... I will be writing to the FCA (UK finance regulator) in due course for their assessment,” she said.\nMorgan has also written to Pester to find out what went wrong, the extent of the failure, and how TSB intends to compensate customers.
