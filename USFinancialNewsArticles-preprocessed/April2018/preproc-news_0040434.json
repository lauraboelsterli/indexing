    "text": "Two siblings who survived the high school shooting in Parkland, Fla. are penning a book about the massacre and the gun-control movement that followed.\nThe book titled #NeverAgain by David Hogg , one of the most recognizable faces of the movement, and his younger sister, Lauren Hogg, who has also been active in the effort, will chronicle the Valentine's Day Shooting and how the pair — along with other students — aimed to start a revolution to stop gun violence.\nIt's scheduled to be released June 5.\nRead more from USA TODAY: \nSouthwest emergency landing pilot Tammie Jo Shults is a pioneer with 'nerves of steel' \nAmazon's Jeff Bezos says Amazon Prime members top 100 million \n401(k) success depends more about \" mind-set \" than size of paycheck\nDavid Hogg, 17, announced the book on his Twitter account Wednesday, explaining he and his 14-year-old sister will share the story of \"this movement for those we lost\" and added that proceeds would be used to \"help heal the community.\"\nHe first gained attention while filming, reporting and interviewing other students while on lockdown during the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Within hours, he and others started calling for a change to gun laws.\ntweet \nHogg became one of the leaders of the #NeverAgain movement and helped plan the March for Our Lives event in Washington, D.C. last month. He also got in a fight with Fox News host Laura Ingraham earlier this month after she mocked him about not getting into several colleges.\nHogg called for a boycott and Ingraham lost more than a dozen advertisers within days.\nThe 128-page novel will serve as a guide to the student-led movement and detail the \"voices of a new generation that are speaking truth to power, and are determined to succeed where their elders have failed,\" according to Penguin Random House , which is publishing the book.",
