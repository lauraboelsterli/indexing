    "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea’s customs agency is looking into accusations that the youngest daughter of Korean Air Lines’ chairman, and other family members, did not pay customs duties on luxury goods brought into the country, the agency said on Wednesday.\nCho Hyun-min, a senior vice president at Korean Air Lines and a daughter of its chairman Cho Yang-ho, arrives at Incheon International Airport in Incheon, South Korea, in this still image from MBC exclusive news report footage obtained by Yonhap on April 15, 2018. MBC footage/Yonhap via REUTERS Cho Hyun-min, a senior vice president of Korean Air, is already under investigation by police for possible assault after it was reported she threw water at people during a business meeting.\nCho previously told a South Korean TV channel that she “pushed” a cup of water but did not throw it at anyone’s face, as media had reported.\nCho, also known as Emily Cho, is the second daughter of the Korean Air chairman to infuriate the public with petulant behavior.\nSlideshow (3 Images) Her older sister Heather Cho made headlines over a notorious “nut rage” incident in 2014, when she lost her temper over the way she was served nuts in first class and ordered the Korean Air plane return to its gate at a New York airport.\nSince the controversy arose surrounding Emily Cho, there have been claims on social media and a local media story citing an unnamed Korean Air employee saying she and other members of the chairman’s family bought luxury goods abroad then brought them into South Korea without paying customs tax.\nThe Korea Customs Service said although the matter is not an official investigation yet, the agency will seek to confirm facts and open an investigation if needed.\nKorean Air declined comment.\nReporting by Joyce Lee and Joori Roh; Editing by Michael Perry\n ",
