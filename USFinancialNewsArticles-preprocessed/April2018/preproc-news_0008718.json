    "text": "AUGUSTA, Georgia (Reuters) - Tiger Woods received a rousing ovation that was three years in the making on Thursday as the smiling former world number one made his much-anticipated return to the U.S. Masters.\nTiger Woods of the U.S. walks to the fourth tee during first round play of the 2018 Masters golf tournament at the Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia, U.S., April 5, 2018.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst The 42-year-old, who finished in the top-12 in three of the five tournaments he has played this year in his latest comeback, has been the major talking point and the main draw all week at Augusta National.\nWoods made another par at the second hole before draining a 10-foot birdie putt at the third to reach one under.\n“Definitely Tiger,” Chris Neubauer, a 31-year-old construction manager from San Diego, said when asked who he was watching most closely in the opening round. “There’s just something real exciting about watching him.”\nAlexis Carras, an 18-year-old student from Michigan, was also following Woods on her first visit to Augusta National.\n“My parents grew up in his heyday and they idolized him,” Carras said. “He made golf cool and so it’s awesome to be out here watching him for the first time.”\nReporting by Frank Pingue; Editing by Alexander Smith\n ",
