    "text": "BEIJING, April 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Sohu.com Inc. (NASDAQ: SOHU), China's leading online media, video, search and gaming business group, today reported that on April 5, 2018, Changyou.com Limited (NASDAQ: CYOU), Sohu's majority-owned online game subsidiary, announced that Changyou's board of directors has declared a special cash dividend of US$4.70 per Class A ordinary or Class B ordinary share, or US$9.40 per American depositary share (\"ADS\"), each of which represents two Class A ordinary shares. The aggregate amount of the special cash dividend will be approximately US$500 million.\nRecord holders of Changyou's ordinary shares at the close of business U.S. Eastern Time on April 20, 2018 (the \"Record Date\") will be entitled to receive the special cash dividend. Changyou expects The Bank of New York Mellon, the depositary bank for Changyou's ADS program, to distribute dividends to holders of ADSs as of the Record Date on or about April 26, 2018.\nThe amount of the dividend payable to Sohu is expected to be approximately $340 million. Sohu does not expect to pay any of such dividend to its stockholders, as the proceeds will be used to support Sohu's operations.\nIn order to facilitate the distribution of this special dividend, Changyou has revised its policy for its PRC subsidiaries with respect to their distribution of cash dividends. Under the revised policy, all PRC subsidiaries in the Changyou Group will be able to distribute their cumulative available and undistributed earnings to their direct overseas parent companies in the Changyou Group. The change will result in Changyou's accrual of additional withholding income taxes of approximately $47 million for the period before December 31, 2017. As the parent company of Changyou, Sohu will also recognize incremental tax expenses in its financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFor more information about the special Changyou dividend, please refer to Changyou's separate announcement.\nAbout Sohu.com\nSohu.com Inc.
