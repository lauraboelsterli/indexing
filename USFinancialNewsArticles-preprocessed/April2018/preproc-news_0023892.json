    "text": "April 10, 2018 / 6:18 PM / Updated 11 minutes ago UPDATE 1-Crude processing in Mexico up 9 pct at 834,000 bpd -Pemex CEO Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Adds comparison to 2017, details on maintenance at two refineries) \nMEXICO CITY, April 10 (Reuters) - Mexican national oil company Pemex is currently processing about 9 percent more crude oil at its domestic refineries than it did in 2017, Chief Executive Officer Carlos Trevino said on Tuesday. \nTrevino told reporters that current processing levels stand at about 834,000 barrels per day (bpd), which compares to crude processing of about 767,000 bpd last year, according to Pemex data. \nThe executive, who took the reins of the state-run company in November, said he expects processing levels to reach about 900,000 bpd once maintenance plans at two facilities are completed. \nTrevino said almost all plants at Pemexâ€™s Ciudad Madero refinery have completed scheduled maintenance, while maintenance at its Minatitlan refinery has experienced some delays.
