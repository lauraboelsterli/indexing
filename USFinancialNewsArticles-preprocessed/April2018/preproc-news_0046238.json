    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Presidio Bank (OTCBB:PDOB), a Bay Area business bank, today reported unaudited results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 with Net Income of $2.2 million, up $1.6 million from the fourth quarter of 2017 and up $1 million (85%) from the first quarter of 2017. The fourth quarter of 2017 included a $1.5 million revaluation of Deferred Tax Assets and Low Income Housing Investments due to tax reform legislation. Net Income in the first quarter of 2018 benefited from a lower Federal Income Tax rate which resulted in a savings of approximately $330 thousand. Total Assets were $850 million at March 31, 2018, up 7% from December 31, 2017. Both Total Loans and Total Deposits grew to record high levels during the quarter.\n“We were pleased to achieve such strong growth in the traditionally slow first quarter of the year,” said Presidio Bank President and CEO Steve Heitel. “In addition, our Net Interest Margin continues to expand resulting in a solid year over year increase in profitability.”\nFinancial Highlights\nTotal Loans Outstanding were up $24 million from the quarter ending December 31, 2017 and up $72 million from March 31, 2017 or 12%. New Loan Originations were strong at $80 million up from $69 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Loan growth was centered in Commercial Real Estate, $12 million and Land and Construction, $9 million. Commercial and Industrial loans were also up modestly. Total Deposits increased by $54 million from the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and increased by $150 million from March 31, 2017 or 25%. This type of deposit growth is unusual for the first quarter of the year when the Bank tends to see modest growth or even net outflows. While the Bank continues to add new deposit relationships, a significant portion of the growth in the first quarter was transactional in nature and will likely normalize during the next two quarters. Net Interest Income of $8 million in the first quarter of 2018 was up 4% from the fourth quarter of 2017 and up 26% from the first quarter of 2017. This increase is due to higher average loan balances, increased loan yields, and increased interest rates on liquid assets invested by the Bank. Net Interest Margin increased during the quarter to 4.27% from 4.11% in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to higher Loan Yields and flat Cost of Funds. Operating Expenses increased by 13% over the fourth quarter of 2017. This increase was largely due to the seasonal increase in Employer Paid Taxes and Employee Benefits Expense along with an increase in the Loan Loss Provision for Unfunded Loans as a result of growth in unfunded construction loans during the quarter. Operating Expenses increased 11% over the first quarter of 2017 due to growth related increases in Compensation and Benefits, higher occupancy costs due to the lease and leasehold improvements on our new Walnut Creek facility and higher data processing costs. The Bank’s efficiency ratio improved from 71% in the first quarter of 2017 to 62% in the first quarter of 2018. Year-over-year revenue growth is 27% while year-over-year expense growth is 11%. Credit Quality remains stable and strong with a Classified to Capital Ratio of 3.4% at March 31, 2018. The Loan Loss Provision Expense for the first quarter was $159 thousand driven by growth in the loan portfolio. Total Criticized and Classified Loans are flat from December 31, 2017 and represents only 3% of Loan Commitments and 4% of Loans Outstanding at March 31, 2018. The Bank has no Non-Performing Loans. Diluted Earnings per Common Share were $0.34 for the quarter, up from $0.09 in the fourth quarter of 2017 and up from $0.19 in the first quarter of 2017. Book Value per Share increased to $12.68 per share at March 31, 2018 from $12.29 per share at December 31, 2017 and $11.50 per share at March 31, 2017.\n“While we are proud of our financial results, we are equally proud of our commitment to giving back to the communities we serve as evidenced by our Outstanding rating in Community Reinvestment and our perennial inclusion on the San Francisco Business Times list of top corporate philanthropists,” said Presidio Bank Chairman and Founder, Jim Woolwine.”\n1 st Quarter 2018 Financial Results\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts, unaudited)\nCondensed Balance Sheet\n3/31/2018 12/31/2017 Change 3/31/2017 Change Cash and due from banks 14,682 7,613 92.9% 6,239 135.3% Interest bearing due from banks 154,434 129,952 18.8% 88,944 73.6% Total cash and equivalents 169,116 137,565 22.9% 95,183 77.7% Investment securities 11,810 12,313 (4.1%) 12,893 (8.4%) Loans, net of fees 649,994 626,282 3.8% 578,033 12.4% Allowance for loan losses (7,325) (7,166) (2.2%) (6,868) (6.7%) Net loans 642,669 619,116 3.8% 571,165 12.5% Premises and equipment, net 2,537 2,627 (3.5%) 1,005 152.4% Other assets and interest receivable 23,796 22,237 7.0% 11,610 105.0% Total assets 849,928 793,858 7.1% 691,856 22.8% Non-interest-bearing demand 337,201 295,070 14.3% 233,059 44.7% Interest bearing transaction 108,399 120,109 (9.7%) 98,560 10.0% Money market and savings accounts 262,503 238,706 10.0% 228,801 14.7% Time deposits 50,082 50,269 (0.4%) 48,016 4.3% Total deposits 758,185 704,154 7.7% 608,436 24.6% Borrowings 10,059 10,174 (1.1%) 9,860 2.0% Other liabilities 4,466 4,767 (6.3%) 4,233 5.5% Total liabilities 772,710 719,095 7.5% 622,529 24.1% Common stock 66,241 65,960 0.4% 64,801 2.2% Retained earnings 11,079 8,854 25.1% 4,581 141.8% Other comprehensive income (102) (51) (98.3%) (55) (85.4%) Total shareholder’s equity 77,218 74,763 3.3% 69,327 11.4% Total liabilities and equity 849,928 793,858 7.1% 691,856 22.8% Book value per share Book value per share $ 12.68 $ 12.29 $ 11.50 Total shares outstanding EOP 6,090 6,084 6,030 Capital Ratios Tier 1 leverage ratio 9.7% 9.7% 9.7% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio 9.5% 9.8% 10.1% Tangible common risk-based ratio 9.5% 9.8% 10.1% Total risk-based capital ratio 11.7% 12.1% 12.6% Condensed Statement of Income (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts, unaudited)\nFor the three months ended Change Change\n3/31/2018\n12/31/2017\nFav./ 3/31/2017\nFav./\n(Unfav.)\n(Unfav.)\nInterest income 8,570 8,236 4.1% 6,853 25.1% Interest expense 487 483 (1.0%) 422 (15.5%) Net interest income 8,083 7,753 4.2% 6,431 25.7% Provision for loan loss 159 -
