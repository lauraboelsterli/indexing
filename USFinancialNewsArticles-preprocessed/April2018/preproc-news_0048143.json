Using data from the U.S. Census Bureau, SmartAsset ranked each city based off the percent of women with bachelor's degrees, the median earnings for full-time working women, the percent of women-owned businesses, the unemployment rate, housing costs as a percent of women's earnings and the percent of women who earn at least $75,000. \nThe D.C. metro area ranked highly on the list with Arlington, Virginia; Alexandria, Virginia and Washington, D.C. among the top 10 cities where a sizeable number of women earn high salaries and own their own companies. \nTake a look at the list below to see what other cities rounded out the top 10 spots:\nHenryk Sadura | Getty Images  1.
