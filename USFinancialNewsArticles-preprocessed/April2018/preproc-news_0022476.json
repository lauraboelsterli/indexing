Kotak Mahindra Bank climbed as much as 1.6 percent to a record after Deutsche Bank raised its rating and price target, citing higher confidence on the lender’s growth.\nHowever, ICICI Bank fell over 2 percent and was among the top percentage losers on the NSE index after reports that the company board is likely to meet to discuss the way ahead for Chief Executive Chanda Kochhar.\nJewellery and accessories retailer Titan Co Ltd rose as much as 3.2 percent to a record on strong quarterly jewellery sales growth.\nAmong other gainers, Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd were trading 4 percent and 2.8 percent higher, respectively.
