    "text": "CHICAGO, April 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ: CME) today reported record revenue of $1.1 billion and operating income of $741 million for the first quarter of 2018. Net income was $599 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.76. On an adjusted basis, net income was $634 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.86. Financial results presented on an adjusted basis for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 exclude certain items, which are detailed in the reconciliation of non-GAAP results. 1\n\"Broad-based strength across all of our asset classes drove first-quarter revenue to more than $1.1 billion, up nearly 20 percent compared with a strong first quarter last year,\" said CME Group Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Terry Duffy. \"We achieved quarterly average daily volume records in five of our six product lines, as well as records in total options and electronic options. From a global perspective, we had growth of 41 percent in Asia and 37 percent in Europe during the quarter, with each product line experiencing increases of more than 30 percent from non-U.S. customers. In addition to significant revenue growth, our focus on expense efficiency contributed to a 50 percent increase in net income compared with the same quarter last year.\"\nFirst-quarter 2018 average daily volume was an all-time high of 22.2 million contracts, up 30 percent compared with first-quarter 2017. Clearing and transaction fee revenue was $974 million, up 23 percent compared with first-quarter 2017. First-quarter 2018 total average rate per contract was $0.706, compared with $0.736 in fourth-quarter 2017, driven primarily by a higher proportion of volume from lower priced financial products, which grew by 49 percent while higher priced commodities rose 15 percent. Market data revenue was $95 million, down 2 percent compared with the first quarter last year.\n1. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial results mentioned to the respective GAAP figures can be found within the Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Measures chart at the end of the financial statements and earnings presentation materials.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the company had $875 million of cash and marketable securities, excluding $491 million held in escrow related to the potential NEX Group plc acquisition, and $2.2 billion of long-term debt. The company paid dividends during the first quarter of $1.4 billion, consisting of the annual variable dividend for 2017 of $1.2 billion and the regular first-quarter dividend of $238 million. The company has returned more than $9.8 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends since implementing the variable dividend policy in early 2012.\nCME Group will hold a Q&A conference call to discuss first-quarter 2018 results at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time today.
