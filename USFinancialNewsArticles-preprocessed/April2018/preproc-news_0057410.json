    "text": "- Earnings of $0.06 Per Fully Diluted Share -\n- Core FFO of $0.20 Per Fully Diluted Share -\n- Leased 259,530 Square Feet of Office and Retail Space -\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE:ESRT) (the \"Company\"), a real estate investment trust with office and retail properties in Manhattan and the greater New York metropolitan area, today reported its operational and financial results for the first quarter of 2018.\n“We continued to execute our long-term strategy to consolidate, redevelop and re-lease space to larger, higher credit quality tenants at higher rents and create long-term value for shareholders. During the quarter, we leased approximately 260,000 square feet of office and retail space that resulted in attractive spreads on both new Manhattan office and total portfolio leases of 23.8% and 11.4%, respectively. Our well-located, amenity-rich office buildings, continue to draw a diverse group of prospective tenants. Our value price point between trophy Class A and Class B properties positions us well to capture steady tenant demand,” stated John B. Kessler, Empire State Realty Trust’s President and Chief Operating Officer.\n“For the quarter, the Observatory overcame the 102 nd floor observation deck’s scheduled closure for replacement of original elevator machinery with a new, higher speed glass elevator with revenue growth of 1.5% and Observatory net operating income growth of 1.7% driven by higher attendance, improved revenue mix and continued expense management,” added Kessler. “We further strengthened our balance sheet with the closing of the final tranches of a $450 million private placement of unsecured senior notes. The proceeds were used to repay our remaining 2018 mortgage maturities and bolster our cash position. We continue to manage the business with a long-term perspective as we proactively position the balance sheet to fund our redevelopment program and allow for potential external growth opportunities.”\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nAchieved net income attributable to the Company of $0.06 per fully diluted share. Core Funds From Operations (“Core FFO”) was $0.20 per fully diluted share.

Empire State Building Observatory revenue for the first quarter 2018 grew 1.5% to $21.2 million from $20.9 million in the first quarter 2017. The 102 nd floor observatory was closed during first quarter 2018 for replacement of original elevator machinery with a new, higher speed glass elevator. If the $1.9 million in revenue in first quarter 2017 from the 102 nd floor observatory is excluded, in the comparable 2018 period revenue increased 11.4%. Lease termination fees and other revenue and fees totaled $6.7 million which included $2.8 million related to the settlement reached with a former broadcast tenant.

The Company’s occupancy levels fluctuate in certain periods due to the timing lag that exists between the date of tenants’ move out and the date of Company’s completion of redevelopment work for new leases to commence. As of March 31, 2018, the Company’s portfolio was occupied and leased as follows. Leased percentages include signed leases not commenced.\nMarch 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 Percent occupied: Total portfolio 88.1% 89.6% 88.8% Total office 88.0% 89.5% 88.3% Manhattan office 87.3% 89.0% 87.8% Empire State Building 92.8% 93.6% 91.5% Retail 89.7% 92.0% 94.4% Percent leased: Total portfolio 91.5% 92.2% 89.5% Total office 91.5% 92.1% 89.2% Manhattan office 91.6% 92.1% 88.6% Empire State Building 93.9% 94.2% 91.7% Retail 91.4% 93.9% 94.5% Leasing\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company signed 41 new, renewal, and expansion leases within the total portfolio, comprising 259,530 rentable square feet with an average starting rental rate of $57.29 per rentable square foot, representing an increase of 11.4% over the previous fully escalated rent.\nOn a blended basis, the 31 new, renewal, and expansion office leases, comprising 192,896 rentable square feet, signed within the Manhattan office portfolio during the first quarter had an average starting rental rate of $58.94 per rentable square foot, representing an increase of 19.1% over the previous fully escalated rent.\nLeases Signed in the First Quarter 2018 for the Manhattan Office Portfolio\n20 new leases, comprising 158,932 rentable square feet, with an average starting rental rate of $59.51 per rentable square foot, representing an increase of 23.8% over the previous fully escalated rent, and 11 renewal leases, comprising 33,964 rentable square feet, with an average starting rental rate of $56.31 per rentable square foot, representing an increase of 0.2% over the previous fully escalated rent.\nSignificant Leases Executed During the First Quarter 2018\nAt 111 West 33 rd Street, the Company signed a new full floor office lease, totaling 41,800 rentable square feet, with Nestlé’s Nespresso USA, Inc., for a term of 10.7 years.

Grant Foundation, for a term of 16.2 years.\nEmpire State Building\nThe Company continues to renovate and lease the 2.8 million rentable square foot Empire State Building, its flagship property. As previously announced in the second quarter 2017, the Company commenced the first phase of a capital project to enhance the experience of office and retail tenants and Observatory visitors. The first phase is underway, and will move the Observatory entrance to a new, larger, designated entrance at the western side of the Empire State Building on 34 th Street, which will improve the commercial tenant and office visitor experience and the value of the Empire State Building’s 34 th Street retail. The Company expects the new entrance to open in the third quarter of 2018.\nDuring the first quarter 2018, the Company signed five office leases at the Empire State Building, representing 25,674 rentable square feet in the aggregate.\nObservatory revenue for the first quarter 2018 was $21.2 million, a 1.5% increase from $20.9 million in the first quarter 2017. The Observatory overcame the 102nd floor observation deck’s scheduled closure for replacement of original elevator machinery with a new, higher speed glass elevator. If the $1.9 million in revenue in first quarter 2017 from the 102nd floor observatory is excluded, in the comparable 2018 period, revenue increased 11.4%. The Observatory hosted approximately 660,000 visitors in the first quarter 2018 compared to 636,000 visitors in the first quarter 2017, an increase of 3.8%. This year, the Easter holiday was spilt between the first and second quarters whereas in the prior year, the Easter holiday fell entirely within the second quarter. In the first quarter 2018, there were 15 bad weather days compared to 22 bad weather days in the first quarter 2017. For the first quarter, the Company estimates that bad weather resulted in approximately fourteen thousand net fewer visitors than in the prior year period.\nBalance Sheet\nAt March 31, 2018, there was no outstanding balance on the Company’s $1.1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and $265 million outstanding under the term loan facility. The facilities have an accordion feature allowing for an additional increase in the maximum aggregate principal balance to $1.75 billion under certain circumstances. The Company held cash and cash equivalents of $690.5 million at March 31, 2018.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had total debt outstanding of approximately $1.9 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 3.84% per annum, and a weighted average term to maturity of 8.8 years. None of the Company’s outstanding debt is subject to variable interest rates. At March 31, 2018, the Company’s consolidated net debt to total market capitalization was approximately 19.5% and consolidated net debt to EBITDA was 3.5x.\nIn January 2018, the Company refinanced and increased its mortgage debt on 1333 Broadway from $66.6 million to $160.0 million, due February 2033 with interest fixed at 4.21%. A portion of this increase was applied to release the $75.8 million mortgage lien on 1400 Broadway.\nIn March 2018, the Company issued and sold $335 million of senior unsecured notes as the final tranches of a $450 million private placement. The notes consist of $160 million 4.26% Series E Senior Notes due 2030 and $175 million 4.44% Series F Senior Notes due 2033. Proceeds were applied towards repayment of the Company’s mortgage indebtedness on 111 West 33 rd Street and 1350 Broadway and added to cash balances.\nDividend\nOn March 30, 2018, the Company paid a dividend of $0.105 per share for the first quarter 2018 to holders of the Company’s Class A common stock and Class B common stock and to holders of the operating partnership’s Series ES, Series 250 and Series 60 operating partnership units (NYSE Arca: ESBA, FISK and OGCP, respectively) and Series PR operating partnership units.
