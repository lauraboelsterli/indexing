    "text": "April 26, 2018 / 6:15 AM / Updated 40 minutes ago Barclays confident can restore capital levels depleted by U.S. fine Lawrence White 4 Min Read\nLONDON (Reuters) - Barclays said rising profits from its investment bank will be enough to restore capital levels depleted by misconduct fines in Britain and the United States, as the British lender announced a characteristically mixed set of first-quarter earnings. Workers are seen in at Barclays bank offices in the Canary Wharf financial district in London, Britain, November 17, 2017. Picture taken November 17, 2017. REUTERS/Toby Melville\nThe earnings came a week after Barclays announced Chief Executive Jes Staley would keep his job but face a fine following the results of a regulatory probe into his attempts to unmask a whistleblower.\nStaley told reporters he is “very comfortable” with the results of that investigation when asked if he would challenge the findings, suggested he could move swiftly to pay the fine and try to put the matter behind him.\nBarclays shares initially fell by more than 2.5 percent on Thursday morning as investors digested the bad news in the earnings report first but the shares then recovered.\nThat bad news included a core capital ratio that fell to 12.7 percent and a statutory loss for the quarter of 236 million pounds ($328.3 million), both driven by fines and legal costs from historic misconduct issues.\nBarclays took a 1.4 billion pound hit from settling with the U.S. Justice Department over the sale of toxic mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the 2007 financial crisis. Cover for claims against mis-selling of payment insurance products in Britain cost it a further 400 million pounds.\nBarclays shares recovered partially to be up 0.6 percent by 0905 GMT as investors looked beyond the conduct costs to see an improved performance at its under-pressure investment bank, which executives said will prevent the need for a capital raise.\n“We feel pretty comfortable, we generated 43 basis points of capital in this quarter alone... so to get back to 13 percent [core capital ratio] is relatively straightforward,” the bank’s finance director Tushar Morzaria told reporters on a conference call.",
