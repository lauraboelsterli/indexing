Over the past few years, Group III base oil market has been growing 8.9% (2013~17 CAGR) due to stricter environmental regulations in the world including the U.S. and Europe.\nThrough the public offering, the company will issue 12,765,957 common shares (face value of a share is KRW 2,500) with the ratio of secondary offering to new shares 8 to 2.
