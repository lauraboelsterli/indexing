    "text": "HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese sportswear retailer Pou Sheng International (Holdings) Ltd ( 3813.HK ) said its parent’s plan to take the company private had been canceled as more than 10 percent of shareholders voted against the proposal.\nPou Sheng’s parent firm, Taiwan’s Pou Chen Corp ( 9904.TW ) proposed taking Pou Sheng private in a deal valuing it at $1.4 billion.\nShares in Pou Sheng fell nearly 36 percent in early Tuesday trade on the news.\nPou Sheng’s largest shareholder Yue Yuen Industrial (Holdings) Ltd ( 0551.HK ) had agreed to sell its 62 percent stake in the company as part of the plan to privatize. After the planned sale, Yue Yuen planned to distribute a special dividend to its shareholders.\nWith the privatization canceled there will now be no special dividend, Yue Yuen said in a separate statement. Its shares slid 11 percent on Tuesday.\nYue Yuen had agreed to sell its stake in Pou Sheng at a cancellation price of HK$2.03 per share, which would value Pou Sheng at HK$11 billion ($1.4 billion). The offered price however was still at a discount to Pou Sheng’s initial public offering price of HK$3.05 per share.\nPou Sheng was spun off from Yue Yuen and listed separately in 2008. Its share price has never matched or exceeded the IPO price.\nPou Chen, Yue Yuen or any other related party in the privatization proposal cannot propose another deal within the next 12 months, Pou Sheng said.\nReporting by Donny Kwok and Kane Wu; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Christian Schmollinger\n ",
