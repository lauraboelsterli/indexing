After an initial blaze was extinguished, a storage tank was punctured, and a second fire erupted, Husky Energy spokesman Mel Duvall said.\nAnother tank caught fire at 3:15 p.m., a local ABC affiliate reported, citing Douglas County authorities.\n“Our focus in the days ahead will turn to the investigation and understanding the root cause of the incident,” Husky Energy said in a late Thursday Twitter post.\nThick black smoke billowed from the facility and hung over Superior throughout the day on Thursday, forcing tens of thousands to flee homes and businesses.\nFriday classes were canceled in Superior and nearby Maple school districts.\nThere were no reports of fatalities, and all of the refinery’s workers have been accounted for, Husky Energy’s Duvall said.\nThe refinery had additional workers on site preparing for a plant-wide overhaul when the blast occurred, he said. It produces asphalt, gasoline, diesel and heavy fuel oils, largely using heavy crude oil imported from Canada.\nThe U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board has sent a four-person team to investigate. The non-regulatory federal agency investigates serious chemical accidents such as refinery fires.\nHusky purchased the refinery from Calumet Specialty Products Partners LP last year.
