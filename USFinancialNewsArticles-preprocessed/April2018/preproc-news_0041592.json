    "text": "A look at some of the key business events and economic indicators upcoming this week:\nSALES REBOUND?\nDespite a dearth of homes on the market, sales of new U.S. homes have been declining lately.\nSales slipped 0.6 percent in February, the third straight monthly drop, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 618,000. The sales decline comes as mortgage rates have been mostly rising. Even so, economists predict the Commerce Department will report Tuesday that sales of new homes rose in March.\nNew home sales, seasonally adjusted annual rate, by month:\nOct. 616,000\nNov. 711,000\nDec. 653,000\nJan. 622,000\nFeb. 618,000\nMarch (est.) 627,000\nSource: FactSet\nFACING QUESTIONS\nFacebook has been on the hot seat lately amid heightened scrutiny over its handling of its users' private data.\nDuring his two-day testimony before Congress earlier this month, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said regulation of the social network is \"inevitable.\" Facebook reports first-quarter results Wednesday. Investors will be listening for any new details on how the user data fallout is affecting the company's business.\nEYE ON THE ECONOMY\nThe Commerce Department delivers its latest quarterly estimate of U.S. economic growth Friday.\nEconomists project that the economy, as measured by the gross domestic product, increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.2 percent in the first quarter. That would be down from the previous three quarters, when the economy posted its strongest growth in more than a decade.\nGDP, seasonally adjusted annual rate, by quarter:\nQ4 2016: 1.8\nQ1 2017: 1.2\nQ2 2017: 3.1\nQ3 2017: 3.2\nQ4 2017: 2.9\nQ1 2018 (est.): 2.2\nSource: FactSet",
