This buyback program includes repurchases made to offset annual incentive share issuance. The cumulative amounts repurchased under this three-year program are now as follows:\nShare Buyback Program 2016-2018\nPeriod Cumulative shares repurchased in period Total consideration\n(€ million) Average share price\n(€) 2018 To Date 4,194,950 177.7 42.37 2017 7,768,288 300.0 38.62 2016 5,826,473 199.7 34.28 Total 17,789,711 677.5 38.08 As stated on February 21, 2018, we intend to execute up to €400 million in share buybacks in 2018, including €200 million to mitigate the EPS dilution related to the sale of Corsearch and certain Swedish assets . In addition, following the completion of the sale of ProVation on March 9, 2018, we also intend to deploy these proceeds of this sale (approximately €150 million) towards additional share repurchases in 2018 and 2019 to mitigate the expected EPS dilution.\nCurrent repurchases are being executed under a third party mandate granted on February 21, 2018. Under this mandate, €150 million of share buybacks will be executed in the period from February 23, 2018 up to and including May 7, 2018.\nShare repurchases are made within the limits of relevant laws and regulations, in particular Regulation (EU) 596/2014) and Wolters Kluwer's Articles of Association. Repurchased shares are added to and held as Treasury shares and will be used for capital reduction purposes or to meet obligations arising from share-based incentive plans.\nFurther information is available on our website:\nDownload the share buyback transactions excel sheet for detailed individual transaction information.
