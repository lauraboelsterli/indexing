    "text": "April 16, 2018 / 10:08 AM / Updated 7 hours ago Robert Durst of 'The Jinx' faces hearing into murder charges Dan Whitcomb 3 Min Read \nLOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Real estate scion Robert Durst was due in court in Los Angeles on Monday as a judge seeks to determine if he should stand trial for the 18-year-old murder of a friend who prosecutors say could tie him to the presumed killing of his wife. FILE PHOTO: Robert Durst attends a motions hearing on capital murder charges in the death of Susan Berman in Los Angeles, California, U.S. January 6, 2017. REUTERS/Mark Boster/Pool/File Photo \nDurst, 75, the enigmatic subject of the popular HBO documentary “The Jinx,” was charged with the murder of Susan Berman in 2015, a day after that broadcast aired its final episode. \nThe six-part miniseries investigated Durst’s ties to Berman’s slaying, his wife’s unsolved 1982 disappearance and his 2003 acquittal in the slaying and dismemberment of a Texas neighbour. \nIn the closing minutes of “The Jinx”, Durst, the heir to a New York real estate fortune, is heard muttering to himself off-camera, “What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.” The documentary has provided grist for prosecutors even as defence attorneys have sought to keep the footage out of court and discredit the production as biased against their client. \nProsecutors say Durst fatally shot Berman, a 55-year-old writer and the daughter of an organised crime figure, in Los Angeles in 2000 because of what she knew about the death of his wife. \nBerman was found shot to death execution-style in her home a few months after it was revealed that police in New York had reopened an investigation into the disappearance and presumed slaying of Kathleen Durst, who was a medical student in New York when she vanished. \nDurst has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder charges stemming from Berman’s death. He also has denied having anything to do with the disappearance of his wife, whose body was never found. He has never been arrested or charged in that case. \nIn 2001, Durst, who was living at the time disguised as a mute woman, was arrested on suspicion of killing and dismembering his elderly neighbour, Morris Black. \nDurst admitted during trial that he killed and carved up Black, but a jury acquitted him of homicide after he argued it was an accidental shooting in self-defence. He spent about three years in jail for related minor charges. Reporting by Dan Whitcomb; Editing by Clarence Fernandez",
