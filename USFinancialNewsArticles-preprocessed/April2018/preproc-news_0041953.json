    "text": "TORONTO, April 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Inter-Rock Minerals Inc. (TSX-V:IRO) (“Inter-Rock” or the “Company”) today reports its 2017 year-end operational and financial results. All amounts in United States dollars, unless otherwise indicated.\n2017 Highlights\nRevenue of $51.9 million, as compared with $30.1 million in 2016, (2016 includes only nine months of Papillon’s results).\nOperating cash flow of $4.2 million, as compared with $1.9 million in 2016.\nReduced debt by $2.3 million. Consolidated debt at year-end was $7.1 million.\nTons sold at Papillon and MIN-AD were 36% and 6% higher respectively than 2016.\n“2017 was a strong year for Inter-Rock, generating record revenue and cash flow. All three businesses recorded higher operating cash flow in 2017 as compared with the year earlier. The strong cash flow allowed the Company to reduce debt by $2.3 million in 2017,” said Mr. Michael Crombie, Chief Executive Officer.\n“Despite a forecast of continuing low milk prices for at least the first half of 2018, the Company is budgeting a slight increase in overall tons sold by both Papillon and MIN-AD in 2018, while Mill Creek is targeting an increase in higher margin sales to the float glass industry. The Company will continue to focus on reducing its debt in 2018 and plans to refinance approximately $3.6 million of debt that is scheduled to mature in the first quarter of 2019,” Mr. Crombie added.\nAssociated Documents\nThis press release should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 and associated Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”), which are available on the Company’s website, www.interrockminerals.com , in the Regulatory Filings section under News & Filings, and on SEDAR ( www.sedar.com ).\nCompany Contact:\nRobert Crombie, CFO\n416-367-3004\nCompany website: www.interrockminerals.com\nAbout Inter-Rock\nInter-Rock owns three operating businesses: Papillon Agricultural Company Inc.
