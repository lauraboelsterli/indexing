    "text": "April 12, 2018 / 4:34 PM / Updated 24 minutes ago House Speaker Ryan touts farm, immigration bills Reuters Staff 1   U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday he would like to see action this year on a rewrite of U.S. farm policy and legislation protecting young, undocumented immigrants from deportation, despite signs both are likely to stall. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) leaves after a weekly news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., April 12, 2018. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas \n“I want to get this done this spring,” Ryan said at a news conference, referring to possible House passage of a farm bill with changes to nutrition assistance programs that is expected to face deep opposition. \nOn immigration, Ryan said he “would like to see a border security solution” paired with the immigration measure, but he said Democrats should accept a plan that they already rejected.
