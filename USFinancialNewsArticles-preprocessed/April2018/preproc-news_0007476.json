    "text": "MILAN (Reuters) - Telecom Italia’s (TIM) top shareholder Vivendi does not see a potential entry by Italian state lender CDP into the Italian phone company as a hostile move, a source close to the matter said on Thursday.\nThe French media group, which has built a stake of 24 percent in TIM, welcomes any shareholder as long as they add value to the company, the person added.\nOther sources said earlier that CDP was set to buy a stake of up to 5 percent in TIM in a move intended to safeguard Rome’s interest in a company seen as strategic.\nReporting by Agnieszka Flak, editing by Paola Arosio\n ",
