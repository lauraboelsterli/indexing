REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque “There are ongoing talks. I don’t want to name names, I don’t want to put anyone on the spot, there are ongoing talks. They’ll be back and forth, U.S. and Beijing, and so forth,” Kudlow told Fox Business Network.\nHowever, in an earlier interview Bloomberg TV, Kudlow said discussions had not begun.\nReporting by Makini Brice; Editing by Doina Chiacu\n ",
