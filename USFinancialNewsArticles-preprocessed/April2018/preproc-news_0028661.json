    "text": "Aaron Hicks hit a pair of home runs, including one inside-the-park, and the New York Yankees handed the Detroit Tigers their fifth straight loss 8-6 on Friday.\nHicks, who just came off the 10-day disabled list after recovering from an intercostal strain, also walked twice and drove in three runs. Brett Gardner had two hits, two runs scored and an RBI, Miguel Andujar ripped a pair of extra-base hits and scored twice and Ronald Torreyes added three hits and an RBI for New York.\nWinning pitcher Jordan Montgomery (1-0) gave up three runs on five hits in six innings, and Aroldis Chapman recorded his second save by striking out the side in the ninth.\nThe Yankees became the first team in MLB history to have five different players notch a multi-homer game during the first 14 games of a season.\nJames McCann had two hits, including a homer, and drove in three runs for the Tigers. Mike Fiers (1-1) allowed six runs (five earned) on eight hits in 5 2/3 innings.\nHicks’ inside-the-park homer gave the Yankees a 2-0 lead in the second. With a runner on, Hicks drilled a Fiers breaking pitch off the wall in right-center. The ball ricocheted away from center fielder Leonys Martin as Hicks charged around the bases.\nAndujar sparked the Yankees’ three-run fifth with a leadoff double. One out later, Gardner brought him home with a double. Gardner came around to score on Aaron Judge’s single. Judge stole second and scored on second baseman Dixon Machado’s throwing error.\nThe Tigers broke through in the bottom of the frame on McCann’s first homer of the season.\nHicks led off the sixth with a blast over the right-center wall.\nThe Tigers made it 6-3 in the seventh on Victor Martinez’s run-scoring double and McCann’s sacrifice fly.\nThe Yankees re-established a five-run lead in the eighth.\nJeimer Candelario led off the bottom of the eighth with his first homer. Run-scoring singles by McCann and Jose Iglesias cut New York’s lead to 8-6, but Chad Green came in and struck out Machado with two runners on to end the inning.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
