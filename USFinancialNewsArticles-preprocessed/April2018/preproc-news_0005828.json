    "text": "Revenue efficiency (a) of 99.6% for the fourth quarter yielded revenue of $65.0 million, and a record revenue efficiency of 98.3% for full year 2017 yielded revenue of $319.7 million Further optimized cost structure reducing daily operating expenses for rigs operating under drilling contracts down to approximately $118,000 for full year 2017, as compared to $136,000 for full year 2016 During fourth-quarter 2017, Pacific Santa Ana commenced its contract in Mauritania for Petronas and Erin Energy Corporation exercised an option to extend the Pacific Bora contract for work in Nigeria\nLUXEMBOURG--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pacific Drilling S.A. (OTC: PACDQ) today announced a net loss for fourth-quarter 2017 of $129.7 million, or $6.08 per diluted share, compared to a net loss for third-quarter 2017 of $157.5 million, or $7.38 per diluted share. Net loss for full-year 2017 was $525.2 million, or $24.64 per diluted share.\nOn November 12, 2017 (the “Petition Date”), we and certain of our subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions (the “Bankruptcy Petitions”) for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Bankruptcy Court”).\nCEO Paul Reese said, “We are very proud to have delivered a record revenue efficiency of 98.3% for the full-year 2017. Throughout the year, we also continued to optimize our cost structure. Our full-year 2017 average daily expenses for operating rigs were 34% below our full-year 2014 average, when oil hit its peak.”\nMr. Reese continued, “These strong operating results continue to prove the robustness of our platform, organization, and dedicated team. Our performance continues to be recognized by clients. Even though we are operating under the protection of Chapter 11, we have been invited to participate in all major tenders, and during the fourth quarter we commenced a contract with a significant new client, while an existing client exercised an option to extend. Also, more recently we obtained a letter of intent for drilling services for the Pacific Bora in Nigeria subject to local government approval. While market conditions continue to be challenging, it is encouraging to observe an increase in tendering activity.”\nMr. Reese concluded, “We continue to have active dialogue with our stakeholders and their respective advisors about the future capital structure of the company. As we have stated previously, these discussions are complex and involve many parties, and we remain focused on achieving a capital structure that is sustainable for our company in the long-term.”\nFourth-Quarter Operational and Financial Commentary\nContract drilling revenue for fourth-quarter 2017 was $65.0 million, which included $5.1 million of deferred revenue amortization, compared to contract drilling revenue of $82.1 million for third-quarter 2017, which included $5.5 million of deferred revenue amortization. The decrease in revenues is primarily the result of lower activity on the Pacific Bora and Pacific Scirocco, partially offset from revenues earned by the Pacific Santa Ana starting its contract with Petronas in December 2017.\nOperating expenses for fourth-quarter 2017 were $59.7 million as compared to $58.9 million for third-quarter 2017. The increase in operating expense is primarily the result of costs from the Pacific Santa Ana starting work under its contract with Petronas.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for fourth-quarter 2017 were $22.4 million as compared to $22.1 million for third-quarter 2017. Net of the legal costs associated with the arbitration proceeding and patent litigation, and legal and advisory expenses related to our on-going debt restructuring efforts incurred prior to the Petition Date, our corporate overhead (b) for fourth-quarter 2017 was $11.0 million, compared to $15.3 million for third-quarter 2017. The decrease in corporate overhead expenses was primarily related to severance related costs incurred in third-quarter 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA (c) for fourth-quarter 2017 was $(16.5) million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 million in third-quarter 2017. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily the result of decreased revenues during fourth-quarter 2017.\nInterest expense for fourth-quarter 2017 was $27.4 million, as compared to $51.1 million for third-quarter 2017, primarily due to interest expense not being accrued subsequent to the Petition Date for the 2017 Senior Secured Notes, the 2020 Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Term Loan B.\nDuring fourth-quarter 2017, we classified all income, expenses, gains or losses that were incurred or realized subsequent to the Petition Date and as a result of the Chapter 11 proceedings as reorganization items, which primarily consisted of professional fees.\nIncome tax expense for fourth-quarter 2017 was $8.8 million, as compared to $1.8 million for third-quarter 2017, primarily as a result of the non-cash write-off of deferred tax assets.\nFor fourth-quarter 2017, cash flow from operations was $(37.0) million. Cash balances, including $8.5 million in restricted cash, totaled $317.4 million as of December 31, 2017, and liabilities subject to compromise totaled approximately $3.1 billion.\nUpdate on Financial Restructuring under the Protection of Chapter 11\nWe are currently operating our business as debtors-in-possession in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. After we filed our Bankruptcy Petitions, we sought and obtained approval from the Bankruptcy Court for a variety of “first day” motions, including authority to maintain bank accounts and other customary relief. The relief granted in these motions allows us to continue to operate our business in the normal course.\nUnder the Bankruptcy Code, we had the exclusive right to file a plan of reorganization under Chapter 11 through March 12, 2018. On March 22, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court approved our request for an order under which we, our secured creditor groups and our majority shareholder will take part in mediation before the Honorable James R. Peck, retired Bankruptcy Court Judge for the Southern District of New York. The scope of the mediation will be to facilitate discussions among us and our stakeholders for the purpose of agreeing to the terms of a binding term sheet or restructuring support agreement describing a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization. In addition, the Bankruptcy Court extended the exclusive period during which we can file a plan of reorganization to the earlier of (i) two weeks following the termination of the mediation and (ii) 60 days, or May 21, 2018, without prejudice to seek further extensions of the exclusive period.\nAdditional information about our 2017 financial results and the Chapter 11 proceedings can be found (i) in the Form 20-F containing our annual report for the period ended December 31, 2017 as filed with the SEC, (ii) on the Company’s website at www.pacificdrilling.com/investor-relations/sec-filings , and www.pacificdrilling.com/restructuring or (iii) via the Company’s restructuring information line at: +1 866-396-3566 (Toll Free) or +1 646-795-6175 (International Number).\nThe Company intends to continue to file quarterly and annual reports with the SEC, which will also be available on the Company’s website. The Company will not be holding an earnings conference call this quarter.\nFootnotes (a) Revenue efficiency is defined as actual contractual dayrate revenue (excluding mobilization fees, upgrade reimbursements and other revenue sources) divided by the maximum amount of contractual dayrate revenue that could have been earned during such period. (b) Corporate overhead expenses is a non-GAAP financial measure.

(c) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. For a definition of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to net income, please refer to the schedule included in this release. Management uses this operational metric to track company results and believes that this measure provides additional information that highlights the impact of our operating efficiency as well as the operating and support costs incurred in achieving the revenue performance.
