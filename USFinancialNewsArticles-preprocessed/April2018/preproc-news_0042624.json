(NASDAQ:EQBK), (“Equity,” “we,” “us,” “our”), the Wichita-based holding company of Equity Bank, reported its unaudited results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, including net income allocable to common stockholders for the quarter of $8.7 million, or $0.58 per diluted share.\nBrad Elliott, Chairman and CEO of Equity, said, “We continue to focus on serving as a trusted community bank in our 40-plus bank offices in four states, while adding new communities to our footprint and new talented bankers to our team. In the first quarter, our commercial, mortgage, treasury and retail sales teams worked diligently and effectively to spur organic growth in our markets, including our newest locations in Ponca City, Newkirk and Tulsa. We’ve also added key positions throughout our operations, sales and management teams and we’ll continue to focus on organic growth for our customers and communities.”\nMr. Elliott continued, “Our new markets in Liberal, Hugoton and Blue Springs are tremendous cultural fits for our Company and we’ll continue to uphold their exemplary service and community focus in the future. I am proud of each and every one of our Equity Bank operations, sales and service teams, who work swiftly, intelligently and with great purpose to fulfill our mission of offering sophisticated, customized banking solutions in a diverse group of markets, with an emphasis on local decision making.”\nNotable Items:\nIncome before taxes for the first quarter of 2018 was $11.2 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, compared to $6.9 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, for the same time period in 2017. Income before taxes, adjusted to exclude merger expense, was a record $11.8 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $7.8 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017. Stated diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of 2018 was a record $0.58. Merger expenses, adjusted for estimated income tax, were $412 thousand in the first quarter of 2018, or $0.03 per diluted share. Net income allocable to common stockholders, adjusted for after-tax merger expense, was a record $9.1 million, or $0.61 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 2017 first quarter net income allocable to common stockholders, adjusted for after-tax merger expense, of $5.5 million, or $0.46 per diluted share.\nHighlights of Equity’s growth include:\nTotal loans held for investment of $2.13 billion at March 31, 2018, as compared to total loans held for investment of $2.10 billion at December 31, 2017. Total deposits were $2.37 billion at March 31, 2018, and $2.38 billion at December 31, 2017.

Total assets of $3.18 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $3.17 billion at December 31, 2017. Book value per common share of $26.09 at March 31, 2018 and $25.62 at December 31, 2017. Tangible book value per common share of $18.22 at March 31, 2018 and $17.61 at December 31, 2017.\nOn March 27, 2018, Equity announced the regulatory and shareholder approvals of mergers with Kansas Bank Corporation (“KBC”), parent company of First National Bank of Liberal, Kansas, and Adams Dairy Bancshares, Inc. (“Adams”), parent company of Adams Dairy Bank in Blue Springs, Missouri. Equity announced each merger on December 18, 2017, and the Company expects each transaction to close on May 4, 2018. The mergers with KBC and Adams will be the sixth and seventh since the Company’s initial public offering in November 2015 and Equity will have completed 17 business combinations since 2003.\nAfter the mergers, Equity will operate 48 bank locations in four states, adding five bank offices in Southwest Kansas, including four locations in Liberal and one in Hugoton. Equity will also add Blue Springs, Missouri, to its Kansas City presence of six bank offices, with three locations in Lee’s Summit, Missouri, two offices in Overland Park, Kansas, and one location in Kansas City, Missouri.\nEquity added to its executive leadership team in March 2018, announcing the hire of Craig Anderson as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and the hire of Craig Mayo as Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer. Mr. Anderson oversees commercial banking divisions in Equity’s metropolitan markets of Kansas City, Tulsa and Wichita. Anderson joined Equity after 31 years in various executive and leadership roles at UMB Bank in Kansas City, Missouri, where he most recently served as President of UMB’s Commercial Banking – Eastern Region.\nMr. Mayo oversees Equity’s credit administration and loan operations personnel, processes and decisions throughout Equity’s four-state footprint. Mayo joins Equity after serving as Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer for Investors Community Bank in Manitowoc, Wisconsin.\nFinancial Results for Quarter Ended March 31, 2018\nNet income allocable to common stockholders was $8.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $4.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $3.8 million or 79.1%. Financial results reflect the merger with Prairie State Bancshares, Inc. (“Prairie”), beginning March 11, 2017, the merger with Eastman National Bancshares, Inc. (“Eastman”), beginning November 11, 2017, and the merger with Cache Holdings, Inc. (“Cache”), also beginning November 11, 2017. The Prairie merger added three locations in western Kansas with total assets of $153.1 million; the Eastman merger added four branches in Ponca City and Newkirk, Oklahoma with total assets of $259.7 million; and the Cache merger added one Tulsa, Oklahoma location with total assets of $324.6 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, there was $531 thousand ($412 thousand after-tax) of merger expense related to the Eastman, Cache, Adams and KBC mergers.\nDiluted earnings per share were $0.58 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $0.40 for the comparable period of 2017. Weighted average fully diluted shares were 14,894,180 and 12,081,292 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. The increase in weighted average fully diluted shares reflects the issuance of 479,465 shares in connection with Equity’s March 2017 merger with Prairie and issuance of 1,179,747 and 1,190,941 shares in connection with Equity’s November 2017 mergers with Eastman and Cache.\nNet interest income was $27.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $19.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, a $7.9 million or 39.7% increase. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by growth in loan and securities balances, partially offset by an increase in interest expense as we funded additional earning assets with more deposits and borrowings at higher rates.\nOur net interest margin was 3.91% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to 3.96% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to a 29 basis point increase in our cost of interest-bearing liabilities partially offset by an 18 basis point increase in yield on interest-earning assets.\nThe provision for loan losses was $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Net loan charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2018, came to $352 thousand compared to net charge-offs of $479 thousand for the same period in 2017.\nTotal non-interest income rose to $4.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, versus $3.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Increases in service charges and fees and in debit card income are principally attributable to the addition of accounts and higher transaction volumes associated with the Prairie, Eastman and Cache mergers.\nTotal non-interest expense was $19.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $15.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. These results reflect the effect of the March 2017 addition of three locations in western Kansas, the November 2017 additions of five locations in northern Oklahoma, as well as additional lending, customer service, corporate and operations staff indirectly attributable to mergers and organic growth. Non-interest expense also includes merger expenses of $531 thousand for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Prairie merger expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017, totaled $926 thousand.\nEquity’s effective tax rate for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, was 22.5% as compared to 29.6% for the comparable period ended March 31, 2017. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform”) was enacted, which reduced the U.S. Federal statutory income tax rate from the 35% applicable in 2017 to 21% in 2018. This rate reduction reduced Equity’s estimated annual effective tax rate by approximately 11 percentage points in 2018. Partially offsetting the benefit of the rate reduction was a decrease in excess tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options recorded during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year first quarter. Excess tax benefits were $6 thousand in the first quarter of 2018, down $201 thousand from the excess tax benefits recorded in the first quarter of 2017.\nLoans, Deposits and Total Assets\nLoans held for investment were $2.13 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $2.10 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $22.0 million.\nAs of March 31, 2018, Equity’s allowance for loan losses to total loans was 0.44%, compared to 0.40% at December 31, 2017. Total reserves, including purchase discounts, to total loans were approximately 1.19% as of March 31, 2018, compared to 1.21% at December 31, 2017. Nonperforming assets of $42.4 million as of March 31, 2018, were 1.33% of total assets. Nonperforming assets at December 31, 2017, were $48.2 million or 1.52% of total assets.\nTotal deposits were $2.37 billion at March 31, 2018, as compared to $2.38 billion at December 31, 2017. Total deposits decreased $13.7 million between December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2018. Signature Deposits were $1.65 billion at March 31, 2018, as compared to $1.61 billion at December 31, 2017.\nAt March 31, 2018, Equity had consolidated total assets of $3.18 billion, compared to $3.17 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $5.6 million.\nCapital and Borrowings\nIn connection with the Prairie merger, Equity issued 479,465 shares valued at $31.79 per share, Equity’s closing price on March 10, 2017. Net of $329 thousand of stock issuance costs, the Prairie merger added $14.9 million to stockholders’ equity. Related to the Eastman and Cache mergers, Equity issued 1,179,747 and 1,190,941 shares, in each case, valued at $33.15 per share, Equity’s closing price on November 10, 2017. Net of $299 thousand of stock issuance costs, the Eastman merger added $38.8 million to stockholders’ equity while the Cache merger added $39.2 million to stockholders’ equity, net of $252 thousand of stock issuance costs.\nAt March 31, 2018, common stockholders’ equity totaled $381.5 million, $26.09 per common share, compared to $374.1 million, $25.62 per common share, at December 31, 2017. Tangible common equity was $266.5 million and tangible book value per common share was $18.22 at March 31, 2018. Tangible common equity was $257.2 million and tangible book value per common share was $17.61 at December 31, 2017. The ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was approximately 11.80% and the total capital to risk-weighted assets was approximately 12.81% at March 31, 2018.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures intended to supplement, not substitute for, comparable GAAP measures.

These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about Equity’s industry, management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond Equity’s control. Accordingly, Equity cautions you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although Equity believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from Equity’s expectations include competition from other financial institutions and bank holding companies; the effects of and changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board; changes in the demand for loans; fluctuations in value of collateral and loan reserves; inflation, interest rate, market and monetary fluctuations; changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; and acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses, and similar variables.
