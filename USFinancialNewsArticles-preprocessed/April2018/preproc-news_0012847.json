    "text": "talks@ (Updates prices)\nApril 5 (Reuters) - Canada's main stock index rose more than 1 percent on Thursday, led by a surge in energy stocks and rising confidence that NAFTA talks will result in a positive outcome.\n* At 11:22 a.m. ET (1522 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX Composite Index was up 193.18 points, or 1.27 percent, to 15,357.55.\n* TSX just shy of erasing its weekly losses so far.\n* Darryl White, Bank of Montreal's chief executive, says he is confident that talks to revamp NAFTA will lead to \"positive conclusion.\"\n* Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Wednesday that the three countries had made good progress in the talks but there was still work to be done.\n* Wall Street extended its recovery as trade war fears ebbed and shares of Facebook, Amazon and industrial companies rallied.\n* Suncor Energy gained 5.5 percent and Canadian Natural Resources advanced 4.4 percent, boosting the energy sector by 4.5 percent.\n* The financial sector was up 0.9 percent lifted by the heavy weight banks Toronto-Dominion Bank, Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Nova Scotia, all up about a percent.\n* Spot gold slipped 0.6 percent at $1,324.68 an ounce at 1542 GMT as demand for the safe haven asset eased.\n* Oil prices rose modestly. Brent crude futures were up 30 cents to $68.32 a barrel.\n* Canada's trade deficit unexpectedly rose to C$2.69 billion ($2.10 billion) in February from C$1.94 billion in January as imports grew much faster than exports. Analysts were expecting a C$2.00 billion shortfall.\n* TSX closed at over seven-week low on Wednesday over trade war worries.\n* Nine of 10 main index groups were in the positive territory.\n* The TSX posted 6 new 52-week highs and one new low. Across all Canadian issues there were 13 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows.\n* The largest percentage gainer on the TSX was Corus Entertainment, which rose 19.9 percent after reporting better-than-expected quarterly profit, while the largest decliner was Aliment Td B, down 2.1 percent.\n* Among the most active Canadian stocks by volume were Aurora Cannabis, Canopy Growth Co, and Cenovus Energy.\n* Volume on the TSX index was 85.43 million, while the total volume on Thursday was 126.50 million shares.
