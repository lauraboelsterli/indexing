    "text": "April 27, 2018 / 5:03 AM / Updated 4 hours ago In Alaska, soldiers relish role in U.S. missile defence Justin Mitchell 4 Min Read\nFORT GREELY, Alaska (Reuters) - Two hours south of Fairbanks, Alaska, near the starting point of the Alaska highway, sit row upon row of missile silos embedded in the frozen ground in the shadow of snow-capped mountains. Sergeant Yamil Ramirez, of the 49th Missile Defense Battalion Military Police at the Ft. Greely missile defense complex in Fort Greely, Alaska, U.S., April 26, 2018. REUTERS/Mark Meyer\nDespite their location, far from Washington, D.C., Pyongyang, or Moscow, the 40 missiles here could one day decide the fate of millions of Americans.\nThe missiles and a few dozen National Guard soldiers will form the first line of defence should North Korea, or any other country, fire an intercontinental ballistic missile at the United States.\nIn recent months, North Korea has said it has developed a missile that can reach the United States mainland.\nIn a control room at Ft. Greely, just outside the small town of Delta Junction, five soldiers performed a simulation on Thursday showing reporters how they would respond to an attack.\n“The first threat in the system shows an impact location of Los Angeles,” said Captain Jospeh Radke, the team’s battle analyst, referring to the second largest U.S. city.

REUTERS/Mark Meyer\n“Threat in the system is showing Los Angeles, we’re going to engage at this time,” said Major Terri Homestead, the crew’s director.\nHomestead then gave orders to the team’s weapons operator, Staff Sergeant Justin Taylor, to fire one missile from Ft. Greely and another from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.\nThe five-person team is one of 10 units that operate the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system. They spend 60 percent to 70 percent of their working days running drills, trying to account for any possible scenario.

Knowing not just that you’re protecting the 300 million people in the United States, but also your family members, your friends across the United States.”\nThe system became operational in 2004 under the direction of President George W. Bush. Now there are plans to add 20 more missiles to the 40 waiting silently just underground in Ft. Greely, with additional interceptors at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.\nThe most recent test, in May, was successful. Colonel Kevin Kick, the commander of the 100th Missile Defense Brigade, which oversees the missile defence system, said it was constantly being improved.\n“These ground-based interceptors in the system fielded right now at Ft. Greely and at Vandenberg Air Force Base are the best of what we’ve got,” Kick said. “We’re ready, if called on, to respond to threats against our nation.” Reporting by Justin Mitchell; Editing by Clarence Fernandez",
