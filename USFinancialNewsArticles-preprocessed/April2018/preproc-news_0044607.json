REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne \n“We welcome this first step toward collective bargaining,” Verdi board member Christine Behle said in a statement. \n“A reform of working conditions for cabin crew at Ryanair in Germany is urgently needed,” she added. \nRyanair has been in talks to formalise union recognition in several European countries since its decision in December to recognise unions for the first time in its 32-year history. \nThe next meeting of Verdi with Ryanair representatives has been set for mid-May, Verdi said.
