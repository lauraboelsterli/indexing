It’s four or five weeks (out). We will try and get him ready for the World Cup. \n“He is in Barcelona right now, for the first part of the rehabilitation he is going to be there.” \nAguero is expected to be a key figure for Argentina, who play their opening World Cup match against Iceland on June 16. \nCity were crowned Premier League champions last weekend and Guardiola wants his team to break records before the end of the campaign.

It would be nice to finish good in terms of good feelings. \n“The important thing is to win the title but maybe the records can help us be focussed against the teams fighting to avoid relegation.” \nCity’s opponents Swansea are currently 17th in the league and four points clear of the relegation zone with five matches to play.
