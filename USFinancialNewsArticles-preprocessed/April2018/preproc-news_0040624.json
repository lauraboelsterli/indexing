GLOBAL TOP NEWS • China's ZTE may lose Android license as U.S. market woes build Chinese smartphone maker ZTE Corp's U.S. woes deepened on Tuesday, as regulators proposed new rules that could cut into its sales, while a supply ban means it may not be able to use Android software in its devices, according to a source. • Japan's March exports disappoint on strong yen, trade friction a risk Japan's exports rose less than expected in March due to a strong yen, raising some concern about the outlook for shipments on top of anxiety over Washington's criticism of the nation's large trade surplus with the United States. • Trump's CIA chief in secret meeting with North Korean leader -U.S. officials U.S. Secretary of State nominee and CIA Director Mike Pompeo made a secret visit to North Korea over the Easter weekend and met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to discuss a planned summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, U.S. officials said on Tuesday. LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) • SGX Nifty nearest-month futures at 10,597.50, up 0.4 percent from its previous close. • The Indian rupee is expected to edge lower against the dollar today as better-than-expected housing and industrial output data lifted the U.S. currency from three-week lows. • Indian government bonds will likely open little changed amid lack of fresh triggers, while investors await minutes of the April policy meeting of the nation's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee. The yield on the benchmark 7.17 percent bond maturing in 2028 may trade in a 7.48 percent-7.53 percent band today. GLOBAL MARKETS • U.S. stock indexes rallied on Tuesday on broad-based gains while Netflix and UnitedHealth earnings impressed investors and boosted optimism about the U.S. corporate reporting season. • Asian shares crept ahead after Wall Street took heart from upbeat corporate earnings, though nagging concerns about trade barriers and the global growth outlook kept currencies and bonds subdued. • The dollar held to modest gains after climbing off a three-week low on upbeat U.S. data, although lingering caution over U.S.-China trade tensions confined currencies to narrow ranges. • The U.S. yield curve on Tuesday was at its flattest in over a decade, driven by rising short-dated Treasury yields and a fall at the long end, even as geopolitical and trade risks eased. • Oil prices edged up, lifted by a reported fall in U.S. crude inventories and by the ongoing risk of supply disruptions. • Gold prices slipped while the dollar held its gains on the back of upbeat March U.S. housing starts and industrial production figures.
