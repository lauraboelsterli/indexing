FILE PHOTO: A man walks past a backdrop during an investors meeting of The People's Insurance Company (Group) of China Ltd (PICC) in Hong Kong November 22, 2012. REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo \nPICC said late on Monday in a post to the Hong Kong stock exchange that it plans to issue up to 4.6 billion A-shares in a Shanghai initial public offering. \nPICC’s listing in China would come more than four years after the company went public in a $3.1 billion offering in Hong Kong. PICC is the parent of PICC Property and Casualty Co Ltd ( 2328.HK ). \nThe deal will be underwritten by China International Capital Corp Ltd ( 3908.HK ), Essence Securities, CITIC Securities Co Ltd ( 600030.SS ) and Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities, according to the prospectus posted by China’s securities regulator.
