Alexander Zemlianichenko/Pool via REUTERS Speaking at a Kremlin ceremony where new foreign ambassadors to Moscow presented their credentials, Putin told the envoy from Montenegro: “The current state of affairs in Russia-Montenegro relations clearly does not correspond to the centuries-old traditions of brotherly friendship and spiritual affinity between our peoples.”\n“Russia is in favor of developing links with Montenegro on a mutually beneficial basis,” Putin said.\nRussia was angered by Montenegro’s accession last year to the NATO military alliance.\nReporting by Denis Pinchuk; Writing by Christian Lowe; Editing by Alison Williams\n ",
