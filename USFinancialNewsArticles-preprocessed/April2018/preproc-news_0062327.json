View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180430005867/en/\nTechnavio has published a new market research report on the global packaged basmati rice market from 2018-2022. (Graphic: Business Wire)\nAccording to Technavio market research analysts, the global packaged basmati rice market will grow at a CAGR of over 11% during the forecast period. The growing demand for rice as a staple food is a major factor driving the market’s growth.\nRice is the fastest-growing food staple in Africa and Latin America. The global consumption of rice remains strong, driven by both population and economic growth, especially in many Asian and African countries. Even in developed countries and regions such as the US and the European Union (EU), per capita consumption of rice continues to grow, partly due to immigration from Asian countries.\nThis report is available at a USD 1,000 discount for a limited time only: View market snapshot before purchasing\nSave more with Technavio.

The growing demand for basmati rice is attracting more players, while the market is witnessing increasing M&A activities. Major companies are acquiring smaller companies that specialize in the production of basmati rice to get a foothold in the growing industry. For instance, in April 2017, McCormick & Company acquired 15% shares in Kohinoor Speciality Foods India, a leading Indian company that sells basmati rice under Kohinoor brands. McCormick owns 85% stake in Kohinoor Speciality foods, which makes Kohinoor a 100% subsidiary.\nAccording to a senior analyst at Technavio for food research, “With strategic alliances, manufacturers can broaden their product portfolios by offering new products and can achieve better operational capabilities. Strategic alliances enable large companies to gain a foot grip on a growing market as is the case of the basmati rice market.”\nLooking for more information on this market?
