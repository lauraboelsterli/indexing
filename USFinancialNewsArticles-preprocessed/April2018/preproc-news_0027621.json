    "text": "April 12 (Reuters) - The La Niña weather pattern is likely to transition to ENSO-neutral conditions during the April-May period, a U.S. government weather forecaster said on Thursday.\nThere is a more than 50 percent chance of ENSO-neutral conditions prevailing through the northern hemisphere summer in 2018, the National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center (CPC) said in its monthly forecast.\nENSO-neutral refers to those periods in which neither El Niño nor La Niña is present, according to CPC.
