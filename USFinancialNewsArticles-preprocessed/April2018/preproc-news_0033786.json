    "text": "LEXINGTON, S.C., April 18, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nHighlights\nNet income of $2.7 million, a 54% increase in net income year-over-year Diluted EPS of $0.35 per common share, a 35% increase year-over-year Loan growth of $21.8 million, a 13.5% annualized rate of increase Pure deposit growth (including customer cash management accounts) of $32.1 million, a 17.2% annualized rate of increase Net interest margin (tax equivalent basis) of 3.66%, an increase of 12 basis points over fourth quarter 2017, seventh consecutive quarter of net interest margin expansion Key credit quality metrics continue to be excellent with a net recovery of $21 thousand and non-performing assets of .47% for the quarter Cash dividend of $0.10 per common share, the 65 th consecutive quarter of cash dividends paid to common shareholders\nToday, First Community Corporation (Nasdaq: FCCO), the holding company for First Community Bank, reported net income for the first quarter of 2018 of $2.71 million as compared to $1.76 million in the first quarter of 2017. Diluted earnings per common share were $0.35 for the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $0.26 for the first quarter of 2017.\nFirst Community President and CEO, Mike Crapps, commented, \"We are thrilled with the performance across all metrics and lines of business. Led by tremendous loan growth of $21.8 million in the first quarter, an annualized growth rate of 13.5%, the momentum has continued from the strong fourth quarter of 2017 which had $18.2 million in organic loan growth, a 12.5% annualized growth rate. Growth in pure deposits continues to be an area of strength for our company as well with $32.1 million in growth in the first quarter, a 17.2% annualized growth rate. This growth is coupled with continued excellent credit quality and strong growth in net interest margin. In addition we are pleased with the performance of our mortgage and financial planning areas as we continue to leverage these lines of business.\"\nDuring the quarter, the bank opened a new banking office in downtown Augusta, Georgia at 771 Broad Street. In addition, the bank has since filed an application with regulators to open an additional banking office in Evans, Georgia. As reported previously, the bank also plans to continue expansion in the Upstate of South Carolina with a search underway for a banking office location in the downtown Greenville area.\nCash Dividend and Capital\nThe Board of Directors has approved a cash dividend for the first quarter of 2018. The company will pay a $0.10 per share dividend to holders of the company's common stock. This dividend is payable May 14, 2018 to shareholders of record as of April 30, 2018. Mr. Crapps commented, \"Our entire board is pleased that our performance enables the company to continue its cash dividend for the 65 th consecutive quarter.\"\nEach of the regulatory capital ratios (Leverage, Tier I Risk Based and Total Risk Based) exceed the well capitalized minimum levels currently required by regulatory statute. At March 31, 2018, the company's regulatory capital ratios (Leverage, Tier I Risk Based and Total Risk Based) were 10.18%, 13.90%, and 14.69%, respectively. This compares to the same ratios as of March 31, 2017 of 10.21%, 14.66%, and 15.51%, respectively. Additionally, the regulatory capital ratios for the company's wholly owned subsidiary, First Community Bank, were 9.74%, 13.31%, and 14.10%, respectively, as of March 31, 2018. Further, the company's ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets was 8.40% as of March 31, 2018. As of March 31, 2018, the Common Equity Tier One ratio is 12.00% for the company and 13.31% for the bank.\nAsset Quality\nKey credit quality metrics continue to be excellent. There was a net loan recovery for the quarter of $21 thousand. The non-performing assets ratio, at 0.47% of total assets, is an area of strength for the company and is a decrease from 0.51% at December 31, 2017. Non-accrual loans decreased 8.4% on a linked quarter basis to $3.1 million. Other Real Estate Owned (OREO) balances remained relatively flat during the quarter at $1.9 million. The ratio of classified loans plus OREO now stands at 8.34% of total regulatory risk-based capital as of March 31, 2018 down from 8.86% at December 31, 2017. Loans past due 30-89 days were $3.3 million or 0.49% of loans this quarter.\nBalance Sheet\n(Numbers in millions)\nQuarter Ended\n3/31/18\nQuarter Ended\n12/31/17\n$ Variance\n% Variance\nAssets\nInvestments\n$272.6\n$284.4\n($11.8)\n(4.1%)\nLoans\n668.6\n646.8\n21.8\n3.4%\nLiabilities\nTotal Pure Deposits\n$758.9\n$729.5\n$29.4\n4.0%\nCertificates of Deposit\n161.0\n158.8\n2.2\n1.4%\nTotal Deposits\n$919.9\n$888.3\n31.6\n3.6%\nCustomer Cash Management\n$22.0\n$19.3\n$2.7\n14.0%\nFHLB Advances\n.2\n14.3\n(14.1)\n(98.6%)\nTotal Funding\n$942.1\n$921.9\n$ 20.2\n2.2%\nCost of Funds\n(including demand deposits)\n0.34%\n0.30%\n4bps\nCost of Deposits\n0.25%\n0.22%\n3bps\nRevenue\nNet Interest Income/Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income was $8.534 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase on a linked quarter basis of $476 thousand or 5.9% compared to fourth quarter 2017 net interest income of $8.058 million.

Income from the financial planning and investment advisory line of business was $383 thousand for the quarter, flat on a linked quarter basis and an increase of $125 thousand or 48.4% year-over-year. Total assets under management in this unit are $271.5 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $214.0 million at March 31, 2017, an increase year-over-year of $57.5 million or 26.9%.\nNon-Interest Expense\nNon-interest expense decreased on a linked quarter basis to $7.6 million from $8.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The majority of the decrease was in merger expenses related to the acquisition of Cornerstone National Bank and in marketing expense which was lower in the first quarter due to a planned delay in media advertising which began in March. Income tax expense was positively impacted in the first quarter of 2018 by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nFirst Community Corporation common stock trades on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol \"FCCO\" and is the holding company for First Community Bank, a local community bank based in the Midlands of South Carolina.

principles (\"GAAP\"). These non-GAAP financial measures include \"tangible book value at period end,\" \"return on average tangible common equity\" and \"tangible common shareholders' equity to tangible assets.\" \"Tangible book value at period end\" is defined as total equity reduced by recorded intangible assets divided by total common shares outstanding. \"Tangible common shareholders' equity to tangible assets\" is defined as total common equity reduced by recorded intangible assets divided by total assets reduced by recorded intangible assets. Our management believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful because they enhance the ability of investors and management to evaluate and compare our operating results from period-to-period in a meaningful manner. Non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/first-community-corporation-announces-first-quarter-results-and-cash-dividend-300631925.html\nSOURCE First Community Corporation",
