    "text": "DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Income Opportunity Realty Investors, Inc. (NYSE American: IOR), a Dallas-based real estate investment company, today reported results of operations for the 2017. For the 2017, the Company reported net income of $1.5 million or ($0.36) per diluted earnings per share for the period ended December 31, 2017, as compared to a net income of $2.1 million or ($0.50) per share for the same period ended 2016.\nLand held subject to a sales contract is our sole operating segment. There was no income generated from this segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $438,000 for the 2017. This represents an increase of $42,000 compared to general and administrative expenses of $396,000 for the 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase in legal expenses, audit fees, stock transfer agent fees and reimbursements to Advisor.\nNet income fee to related party was $250,000 for the 2017. This represents a decrease of $7,000, compared to the net income fee of $257,000 for the 2016. The net income fee paid is based upon a contract amount calculated at the rate of 7.5% of net income.\nAdvisory fees were $660,000 for the 2017. This represents an increase of $21,000 compared to advisory fees of $639,000 for the 2016. Advisory fees are a contract amount and are computed based on a gross asset fee of 0.0625% per month (0.75% per annum) of the average of the gross asset value.\nInterest income was $4.2 million for the 2017. This represents a decrease of $0.3 million, compared to interest income of $4.5 million for the 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the payoff of notes receivable related to three income producing properties sold in a prior year.\nThe Company incurred no mortgage and loan interest for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. We have no outstanding debt as of December 31, 2017.\nIncome tax expense was $1.6 million for the 2017 and $1.1 million for the 2016.
