    "text": "April 2, 2018 / 6:32 PM / Updated 5 minutes ago Time Warner pressure on cable carriers cited as U.S. fights AT&T deal Diane Bartz 3 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Justice Department, seeking to stop AT&T Inc’s ( T.N ) deal to purchase Time Warner Inc ( TWX.N ), sought to show how often Time Warner subsidiary Turner would threaten to cut off cable companies to win concessions during contract negotiations. FILE PHOTO: Ticker and trading information for media conglomerate Time Warner Inc. is displayed at the post where it is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., October 21, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid \nThe Justice Department has asked Judge Richard Leon, who is hearing the testimony, to order the companies to abandon the deal on the grounds that it is illegal under antitrust law. \nColeman Breland, who negotiated distribution contracts for Turner for more than two decades, testified about a series of instances in which the movie and TV show maker threatened to “go dark,” essentially cutting off access to content for various cable providers. \nBreland acknowledged that Turner’s leverage in contract talks was the ability to cut off access to content, adding “usually blackouts are temporary.” Breland is still with Turner but is now president of content experiences, TCM and FilmStruck. \nThe U.S. government has argued that AT&T, which owns pay TV service DirecTV, would have more leverage to raise prices by owning Time Warner and would have less incentive to avoid “going dark” because its DirecTV subsidiary could win over rivals’ irritated subscribers. \nBy threatening to go dark, Time Warner was able to get higher rates, convince pay TV companies to take more channels and make sure those channels were offered on a “basic” tier rather than an optional one, Breland acknowledged under questioning. \nCable One lost subscribers after a Turner blackout in 2016 that lasted 25 days, Breland acknowledged although neither he nor the Justice Department’s lawyer Dylan Carson said how many. \nBreland argued that the aggressive negotiating between 2013 and 2017 was a period where the company was trying raise rates that they felt were too low. “We viewed that as a catch-up period for us to get back where we should be,” he said. \nBreland also noted that Time Warner and other content makers faced still competition online from Netflix, Amazon and others. “They are very impressive competitors that want to pull eyeballs away,” he said. \nThe trial, which is taking place in the U.S. District Court in Washington, is expected to take six to eight weeks.
