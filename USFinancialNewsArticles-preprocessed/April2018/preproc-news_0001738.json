    "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China has never given in to external pressure, Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao said on Wednesday, shortly after Beijing unveiled a list of U.S. goods it will target in response to planned U.S. tariffs.\nChinese Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao speaks at the annual session of China Development Forum (CDF) 2018 at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, China March 24, 2018. REUTERS/Jason Lee External pressure will instead promote Chinaâ€™s development and innovation, Zhu told reporters in Beijing.\nFriction is hard to avoid in fast-growing China-U.S. trade, and huge challenges face the two sides, but Zhu said he still hoped relations could return to a healthy track, since a trade war could hurt all sides.\nReporting by Kevin Yao; Writing by Ryan Woo; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\n ",
