GLOBAL TOP NEWS • Trump hopes for successful North Korea summit, but warns he could walk away U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he hoped an unprecedented summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would be successful after a recent visit to Pyongyang by CIA Director Mike Pompeo, but warned he would call it off if he did not think it would produce results. • Facebook to put 1.5 billion users out of reach of new EU privacy law If a new European law restricting what companies can do with people's online data went into effect tomorrow, almost 1.9 billion Facebook Inc users around the world would be protected by it. The online social network is making changes that ensure the number will be much smaller. • POLL-Global economy sprinting ahead but trade war could end the race The global economy will expand this year at its fastest pace since 2010, but trade protectionism could quickly slow it down, the latest Reuters polls of over 500 economists worldwide suggest. LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) • The SGX Nifty nearest-month futures were trading at 10,587.50, up 0.3 percent from previous close. • The Indian rupee is seen lower against the dollar as Brent crude's surge to its highest level since late-2014 pressures the oil importing nation's currency. • Indian government bonds are likely to open lower on higher U.S. Treasury yields and global crude oil prices, even as investors await minutes of the April policy meeting of the nation's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee. Yield on the benchmark 7.17 percent bond maturing in 2028 may trade in a 7.51 percent -7.57 percent band today. GLOBAL MARKETS • The S&P 500 eked out a small gain while the Dow declined after a volatile trading session on Wednesday, with weakness in sectors such as consumer staples and financials offsetting strong gains in the energy and industrial indexes. • Resource stocks were on a roll in Asia as oil prices hit heights not seen since late 2014, though the potential boost to inflation globally also pressured fixed-income assets. • The dollar was steady against a basket of its peers, supported by higher long-term U.S. Treasury yields on improving investor appetite for risk assets, though lingering concerns over U.S.-China trade tensions checked the greenback. • Trading across U.S. government bond maturities was range-bound on Wednesday, as the yield curve nevertheless continued to flatten for the ninth consecutive market day. • Oil prices remained close to highs touched the previous day that were last seen in late 2014, buoyed as U.S. crude inventories declined and as top exporter Saudi Arabia is expected to keep withholding supply to prop up the market. • Gold prices were flat while the dollar stayed firm helped by higher long-term U.S. Treasury yields, though lingering U.S.-China trade tensions kept the greenback's gains in check.
