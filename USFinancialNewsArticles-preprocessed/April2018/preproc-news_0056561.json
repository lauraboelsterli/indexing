(NASDAQ:ATHN) (“athenahealth” or “we”), a leading provider of network-enabled services for hospital and ambulatory clients nationwide, today announced financial and operational results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.

Fiscal year 2018 guidance is prior to the impact of the new revenue recognition standard to allow for comparability against historical results. We will present our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Net Income for our fiscal year 2018 results including the impact of the new revenue recognition standard and will provide a separate reconciliation to results prior to the impacts resulting from the new revenue recognition standard. Finally, the Non-GAAP adjusting line items should not be relied upon individually, as we are not guiding on individual line items, but upon the total operating income metrics, as included within our guidance table below.\n(unaudited, in millions) Previous Revenue Standard LOW HIGH Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2018 Total revenue $ 1,310 $ 1,380 GAAP operating income $ 108 $ 152 GAAP operating margin 8.2 % 11.0 % Add: Stock-based compensation expense 61 50 Add: Amortization of capitalized stock-based\ncompensation related to software development 2 2 Add: Amortization of purchased intangible assets 20 19 Add: Integration and transaction costs 13 10 Add: Exit costs, including restructuring 6 2 Non-GAAP Operating Income $ 210 $ 235 Non-GAAP Operating Margin 16.0 % 17.0 % Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP. However, management believes that, in order to properly understand our short-term and long-term financial and operational trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of certain non-cash or non-recurring items, when used as a supplement to financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP. These items result from facts and circumstances that vary in frequency and impact on continuing operations. Management also uses results of operations before such items to evaluate the operating performance of athenahealth and compare it against past periods, make operating decisions, and serve as a basis for strategic planning. These non-GAAP financial measures provide management with additional means to understand and evaluate the operating results and trends in our ongoing business by eliminating certain non-cash expenses and other items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods more difficult, obscure trends in ongoing operations, or reduce management’s ability to make useful forecasts. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional means of evaluating period-over-period operating performance. In addition, management understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing our financial and operational performance and comparing this performance to our peers and competitors.\nManagement defines “ Non-GAAP Gross Profit ” as total revenue, less cost of revenue, plus (1) stock-based compensation expense allocated to cost of revenue, (2) amortization of purchased intangible assets allocated to cost of revenue, (3) integration and transactions costs allocated to cost of revenue, and (4) exit costs, including restructuring costs allocated to cost of revenue, and “ Non-GAAP Gross Margin ” as Non-GAAP Gross Profit as a percentage of total revenue. Management considers these non-GAAP financial measures and metrics to be important indicators of our operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trends. Moreover, management believes that these measures and metrics enable investors and financial analysts to closely monitor and understand changes in our ability to generate income from ongoing business operations.\nManagement defines “ Non-GAAP Operating Income ” as the sum of GAAP net income (loss) before provision for (benefit from) income taxes; total other expense; stock-based compensation expense; amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation related to software development; amortization of purchased intangible assets; integration and transaction costs; and exit costs, including restructuring costs; and “ Non-GAAP Operating Margin ” as Non-GAAP Operating Income as a percentage of total revenue. Management defines “ Non-GAAP Net Income ” as the sum of GAAP net income (loss) before stock-based compensation expense; amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation related to software development; amortization of purchased intangible assets; integration and transaction costs; exit costs, including restructuring costs; and gain or loss on investments and any tax impact related to these preceding items; and an adjustment to the tax provision for the non-GAAP tax rate and “ Non-GAAP Net Income per Share - Diluted ” as Non-GAAP Net Income divided by weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Management considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be important indicators of our operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trends. Moreover, management believes that these measures enable investors and financial analysts to closely monitor and understand changes in our ability to generate income from ongoing business operations.\nManagement excludes or adjusts each of the items identified below from the applicable non-GAAP financial measure or metric referenced above for the reasons set forth below with respect to that excluded item:\nStock-based compensation expense and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation related to software development — excluded because these are non-cash expenditures that management does not consider part of ongoing operating results when assessing the performance of our business, and also because the total amount of the expenditure is partially outside of our control because it is based on factors such as stock price, volatility, and interest rates, which may be unrelated to our performance during the period in which the expenses are incurred.\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets — purchased intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. Accordingly, this item is not considered by management in making operating decisions. Management does not believe such charges accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are incurred.\nIntegration and transaction costs — integration costs are the severance payments and retention bonuses for certain employees related to specific transactions. Transaction costs are costs related to strategic transactions. Accordingly, management believes that such expenses do not have a direct correlation to future business operations, and therefore, these costs are not considered by management in making operating decisions. Management does not believe such charges accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are incurred.\nExit costs, including restructuring costs — represent costs incurred as a result of strategic realignments including those related to workforce reductions, termination of certain lease or other agreements, and non-cash charges related to the write down of certain assets. Management does not believe such costs accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such costs are incurred.\nGain or loss on investments — represents unrecognized or recognized gains or losses on the fair value, sales, or conversions of our investments, such as marketable securities and More Disruption Please Accelerator investments. Management does not believe such gains or losses accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such gains or losses are reported. Upon the adoption of the new financial instruments accounting standard effective for 2018, we present gains or losses on investments in Other (income) expense on our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income which is not included in Operating Income but is included in the subtotal Income before income tax provision.\nNon-GAAP tax rate — our statutory tax rates of 25% for fiscal year 2018 and 40% for fiscal year 2017 are applied to normalize the tax impact to our Non-GAAP Net Income per Diluted Share based on the fact that historically a relatively small change in pre-tax GAAP income (loss) in any one period could result in a volatile GAAP effective tax rate.\nSource: athenahealth, Inc.",
