    "text": "MADRID (Reuters) - Spain’s Codorniu, a maker of cava sparkling wine, said on Thursday they had rejected a takeover bid by U.S. fund The Carlyle Group, confirming a report in newspaper La Vanguardia, but added they were open to an approach by a potential minority partner.\nBottles of Codorniu cava are seen on a supermarket shelf in Barcelona, Spain, October 16, 2017. REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes The Codorniu board rejected an offer by the fund last week after Carlyle proposed the acquisition of a majority stake, a spokeswoman said.\nCarlyle could not be contacted for immediate comment.\nSome of the private, family-run company’s 216 shareholders plan to sell their stakes and that has prompted Codorniu’s interest in external partners, she said.\nThe spokeswoman could not say how many of the stakeholders wanted to leave or the size of their combined stake.\nThe Catalonia-based company, which has roots that date back to 1551, reported revenue of 236 million euros ($292 million) in the year to June 2017 and expects to report a core profit of 30 million euros this year.\nCodorniu’s search for an external investor comes after rival Freixenet sold 50.7 percent of its shares to Germany’s Henkell last month.\nFreixenet and Codorniu are among the more than 4,000 businesses that have moved their legal headquarters out of Catalonia after an independence movement led to political confrontation between Barcelona and Madrid.\nReporting by Emma Pinedo; writing by Paul Day; editing by Jason Neely\n ",
