    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - France urged Israel on Sunday to show restraint following its military response to Palestinian demonstrations on the Gaza-Israel border that killed at least 15.\n“France reminds the Israeli authorities of their duty to protect civilians and urges them to show the greatest restraint,” a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said in a statement.\n“France also highlights the Palestinians’ right to peacefully demonstrate,” she added.\nIsrael’s defense minister rejected calls for an independent investigation by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Federica Mogherini, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, and other leaders.\nReporting by Leigh Thomas; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\n ",
