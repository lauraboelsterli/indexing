    "text": "Dewayne Dedmon, Mike Muscala and John Collins each had double-doubles as the Atlanta Hawks held off the Orlando Magic 94-88 on Sunday in a battle between the two teams with the worst records in the Eastern Conference at Philips Arena.\nDedmon finished with 17 points and 10 rebounds; Collins had 10 points and 11 rebounds, and Muscala came off the bench to score 13 points and grab 10 rebounds for the Hawks, who snapped a five-game losing streak.\nD.J. Augustin led Orlando with 20 points, and rookie Jonathan Isaac finished with 15 points for the Magic, who have lost two in a row and five of six.\nThe Hawks led 56-43 at halftime. Orlando opened the third quarter with a 10-2 spurt, highlighted by a 3-pointer and a dunk on a baseline drive by Isaac. The Magic continued to cut into the Atlanta lead and were down only five heading into the fourth quarter.\nOrlando got within two on a 3-pointer from Augustin with 7:32 left in the fourth quarter. The Hawks responded with an 8-2 run, with Dedmon and Collins each coming up with buckets during Atlanta’s closing push.\nTyler Dorsey delivered the dagger, knocking down a 3-pointer that gave the Hawks an eight-point lead with two minutes left.\nThe Hawks and Magic have been playing for a potential No. 1 overall draft pick for months. They each head into the final two weeks of the regular season in front of only the Phoenix Suns in the league standings.\nThe Hawks announced Friday that starting point guard Dennis Schroder will the remainder of the season after an MRI revealed a bone bruise in his left ankle.\nSchroder was leading the Hawks in scoring and assists.\nAtlanta is at Miami on Tuesday. Orlando travels to New York to take on the Knicks on Tuesday.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
