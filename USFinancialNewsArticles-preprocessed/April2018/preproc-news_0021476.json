The procession departs after funeral services for radio broadcaster Tyler Bieber, one of the people killed in the crash of a bus carrying the Humboldt Broncos Junior A hockey team, in Humboldt, Saskatchewan, Canada April 12, 2018. REUTERS/Matt Smith \nTyler Bieber, 29, was a radio broadcaster who provided play-by-play calls for the team, the Humboldt Broncos. \nThe first funeral for one of the victims was held at the arena where the team played home games in a town with 6,000 residents. The bus was carrying 29 team players, coaches and others when it collided with a semi-trailer truck.
