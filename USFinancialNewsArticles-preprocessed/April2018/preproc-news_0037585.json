REUTERS/Stephane Mahe/File Photo \nThe maker of power plants, jet engines, medical devices and other industrial goods had estimated the after-tax, non-cash impact would be about $4.2 billion, plus reduced earnings for 2016 and 2017 of about 29 cents a share. The changes do not affect GEâ€™s cash flow or its earnings estimate for 2018, analysts said. Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Bill Rigby",
