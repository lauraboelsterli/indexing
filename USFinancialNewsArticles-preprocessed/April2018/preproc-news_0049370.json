(NYSE:TER) reported revenue of $487 million for the first quarter of 2018 of which $373 million was in Semiconductor Test, $49 million in Industrial Automation, $43 million in System Test, and $23 million in Wireless Test. GAAP net profit for the first quarter was $87.0 million or $0.43 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, Teradyne’s net income in the first quarter was $89.4 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, which excluded acquired intangible asset amortization, restructuring and other charges, non-cash convertible debt interest, discrete income tax adjustments, and included the related tax impact on non-GAAP adjustments.\n\"Despite the strong first quarter results, the demand outlook for 2018 mobile device test capacity declined sharply in the quarter and our second quarter guidance reflects that revised outlook. Those strong first quarter results included record Nextest memory shipments and the highest Eagle analog test shipments in over two years reflecting healthy demand in the automotive, industrial, and NAND Flash markets,” said CEO and President Mark Jagiela. “Universal Robots’ high growth continued in the quarter driven by broad based demand for UR’s easy to use collaborative robots and the group is on-track for 50%+ full year growth.\"\nGuidance for the second quarter of 2018 is revenue of $490 million to $520 million, with GAAP net income of $0.39 to $0.46 per diluted share and non-GAAP net income of $0.45 to $0.52 per diluted share. Non-GAAP guidance excludes acquired intangible asset amortization, non-cash convertible debt interest, restructuring and other charges and includes the related tax impact on non-GAAP adjustments.\nWebcast\nA conference call to discuss the first quarter results, along with management's business outlook, will follow at 8:00 a.m. ET, Wednesday, April 25.

These results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP net income exclude acquired intangible assets amortization, non-cash convertible debt interest, pension actuarial gains and losses, discrete income tax adjustments, and restructuring and other. GAAP requires that these items be included in determining income from operations and net income. Non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP net income as a percentage of revenue, and non-GAAP net income per share are non-GAAP performance measures presented to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Teradyne’s baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that may not be indicative of Teradyne’s current core business or future outlook. These non-GAAP performance measures are used to make operational decisions, to determine employee compensation, to forecast future operational results, and for comparison with Teradyne’s business plan, historical operating results and the operating results of Teradyne’s competitors. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes pension actuarial gains and losses. GAAP requires that these items be included in determining gross margin. Non-GAAP gross margin dollar amount and percentage are non-GAAP performance measures that management believes provide useful supplemental information for management and the investor. Management uses non-GAAP gross margin as a performance measure for Teradyne’s current core business and future outlook and for comparison with Teradyne’s business plan, historical gross margin results and the gross margin results of Teradyne’s competitors. Non-GAAP diluted shares include the impact of Teradyne’s call option on its shares. Management believes each of these non-GAAP performance measures provides useful supplemental information for investors, allowing greater transparency to the information used by management in its operational decision making and in the review of Teradyne’s financial and operational performance, as well as facilitating meaningful comparisons of Teradyne’s results in the current period compared with those in prior and future periods.
