The Network, working in conjunction with the Credit Union National Association (CUNA), works to ensure the success, growth and vitality of its member credit unions by creating a positive public environment through leadership, political advocacy, education, awareness and regulatory assistance. The Network works on behalf of nearly 400 credit union locations that serve over 1.7 million members. MnCUN’s Board of Directors works together with its President/CEO to ensure that all member credit unions receive high-quality service and that the interests of Minnesota credit unions are promoted both at the state and national level.\nMore than 450 credit union professionals, volunteers and vendors from all across Minnesota met for the MnCUN annual meeting at the Radisson Blu Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn. Along with networking and education opportunities, a business meeting, and committee reports, the Board election was held. Two incumbents and one new member were elected to three-year terms on the MnCUN Board of Directors.\n“It’s an honor to be elected to the MnCUN board and to have the opportunity to serve along with my peers from credit unions across the state,” said Smith. “I enjoy serving our TopLine members and I look forward to expanding my service by working to advocate for Minnesota’s million and a half strong credit union members in this new role.”\n“The MnCUN board has always attracted top level talent to serve our many members in Minnesota,” says Mark Cummins, President and CEO, MnCUN. “We look for strong leaders, and Tom Smith is no exception. He’ll fit right in and we look forward to working with him.”\nIn addition to Smith, other members elected are Mary Hansen, Mayo Employees FCU, and Julia Havens, Riverview CU. Dan Stolz of SPIRE will serve as Chair, Karen Fleming of HBI Employees will serve as Vice Chair, and Mary Hansen of Mayo Employees will serve as Secretary/Treasurer.\nTopLine Federal Credit Union , a Twin Cities-based credit union, is Minnesota’s 13 th largest, with assets of more than $415 million.
