    "text": "TOKYO, April 27 (Reuters) - ANA Holdings Inc, Japanâ€™s largest airline by sales, posted a 13 percent rise in full-year operating profit, roughly in line with analyst estimates, on the back of robust demand for international passenger and cargo flights.\nProfit for the year ended March was 164.5 billion yen ($1.51 billion), up from 145.5 billion yen in the same period a year earlier. That compared with the 166.2 billion yen average estimate of 11 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nANA said it expects operating profit for the year through March to be flat at 165 billion yen. ($1 = 109.2400 yen) (Reporting by Sam Nussey)\n ",
