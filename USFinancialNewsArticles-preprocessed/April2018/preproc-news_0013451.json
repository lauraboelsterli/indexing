    "text": "0 COMMENTS Good morning. We heard from Facebook earlier this week that the “Delete Facebook” movement hasn’t had a meaningful impact on the company. Some people reconsidered deleting their accounts because it would cut off a key communications channel with their families. And others found it difficult simply because they have so many services linked with their Facebook logins. But here’s another quirk: The Wall Street Journal spoke to more than a dozen Facebook users from the U.S. and Europe who encountered difficulties deleting their accounts. After clicking the “delete my account” option, the system told them their password was incorrect. But there is a fix, WSJ reports .\nThe Many and the Few The Facebook Apology Tour continued into Thursday, with Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg granting a handful of interviews to the press. Similar to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, she also feels “deeply personally responsible” for the mistakes Facebook made around data security. Ms. Sandberg also confirmed to Bloomberg “a few” brands paused their spending on the platform , but said she and the team are having “reassuring conversations with advertisers” about Facebook’s moves to amp up privacy. Speaking of data-sharing, CNBC reported that Facebook was in talks with U.S. hospitals and medical groups as recently as last month about a proposal to share anonymized information about their patients for a proposed research project . That project has been put on pause in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.\n—Pay Your Rates—\nElsewhere on Thursday, we learned the Media Rating Council has accredited Facebook and Instagram , determining that they correctly report served impressions. That’s just part one of a three-phase audit, though, and marketers will probably be more interested in how accurately the social network shares viewability data with third-party measurement partners (that audit is already happening) and whether Facebook receives accreditation for two-second video ad buying. Later down the line, Facebook plans to schedule its audit for whether it meets the MRC’s ad fraud detection guidelines around sophisticated invalid traffic. Only a smattering of companies have that accreditation so far, such as Microsoft’s Bing, comScore and Integral Ad Science.\nIrwinner Takes It All CMO Today’s Alex Bruell reports : If you haven’t had enough WPP news this week, here’s another big development. GroupM Global Chairman Irwin Gotlieb is stepping down from his role and transitioning to a senior advisory position with WPP, the company announced this morning. “Irwin is a one-of-a-kind visionary, and his mark on our company and the entire media business is indelible,” said GroupM CEO Kelly Clark in a statement. “I am one of many in this industry who count Irwin as a friend and mentor. We’re glad that he will still be available to us and our clients in his new role.” Mr. Gotlieb established the first spinout of a standalone media agency, MediaVest, in 1993. He joined WPP in 1999 to serve as the first Global CEO for Mindshare and later launched GroupM globally. Mr. Gotlieb is also known for his love of technology and gadgets. (Ask him about the hottest camera, and you’ll get an earful.) His departure follows that of GroupM’s Rob Norman, who announced his retirement in November.\nSweets For My Sweet, Sugar For My Honey Most food and drink marketers will do as much as is permissible to downplay the amount of sugar in their products. But cereal marketers are on a sugar high , following years of trying to go down the healthy route to win back consumers who had switched to other breakfast items like shakes, yogurt and protein bars, the WSJ reports. Research has found that adults and children care less about nutrition and more about fun flavors and colors when it comes to their cereal tastes—and many aren’t just thinking about cereal for breakfast. To be sure, overall sales of cereal are still down, but sales of children’s cereal, which emphasize sweet tastes and cartoon mascots, are faring better than adult brands marketed as healthier. “Taste is king,” said Dana McNabb, General Mills’ president of cereal, who oversaw the company’s latest creations—Chocolate Peanut Butter Cheerios, Lucky Charms Frosted Flakes and Cinnamon Toast Crunch shredded wheat.\nPerfect Duet Two interesting bits of video and TV ad tech news out on Thursday. First up, cable operator Altice USA has launched a 500-person ad-tech division called A4 , AdExchanger reported. The sell to marketers is that they can use A4’s platform to buy highly-targeted audiences (such as people in the market for a new car) across digital screens and on local and national TV. Altice USA and its parent company, based in the Netherlands, have been particularly acquisitive in the past few years, having snapped up Cablevision in 2016 and last year acquiring ad tech firms Teads, Placemedia and Audience Partners. A4 is essentially the product of those deals. (Altice announced it was spinning off its U.S. unit as a separate business earlier this year.) Elsewhere, Business Insider reports Disney is asking for pitches from Google and other ad-tech companies to potentially take over its video ad infrastructure. The incumbent is Comcast’s FreeWheel, which has also been asked to pitch.\nBest of the rest Netflix is reportedly offering more than $300 million to acquire outdoor advertising company Regency Outdoor, which owns billboards across Los Angeles. It comes as the streaming giant is stepping up its marketing efforts. [ Reuters ]\nProPublica writer (and WSJ alum) Julia Angwin, who has led many investigations on how Facebook’s ad platform can be misused, writes for the Atlantic with some ideas on how the government could fix Facebook. [ The Atlantic ]\nFacebook removed messages people received from Mark Zuckerberg on Messenger. The company said it “made a number of changes to protect our executives’ communications” after the Sony Pictures email hack in 2014. [ TechCrunch ]\nThe U.K.’s Information Commissioner’s Office is now investigating 30 companies—including Facebook, Cambridge Analytica and Aggregate IQ—as part of its investigation into the use of personal data and analytics for political purposes. The ICO declined to comment when contacted by CMO Today about the other companies being investigated. [ The Telegraph ]\nYouTube is reportedly looking to add a number of digital publishers—including Cheddar, Tastemade and the Young Turks Network—to its YouTube TV $40-a-month livestreaming service. [ Digiday ]\nNike released an ad celebrating Tiger Woods’s return to the Masters. The spot chronicles his career, including his most-memorable shots, interviews and ads.
