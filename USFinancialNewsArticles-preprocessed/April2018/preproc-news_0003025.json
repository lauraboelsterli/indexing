    "text": "Brussels is preparing to crack down on social media companies who have been accused of spreading \"fake news\", issuing a stark warning that scandals such as the Facebook data leak threaten to \"subvert our democratic systems\".\nThe European Commission fears that next year's elections to the European Parliament are vulnerable to mass eurosceptic online \"disinformation\". Its concern sharpened after a whistleblower alleged that Cambridge Analytica gathered personal information from up to 50m Facebook users and used it to target voters in the US presidential election. Cambridge Analytica has denied using Facebook data in its modelling.\nJulian King, European commissioner for security, is demanding a \"clear game plan\" for how social media companies can operate during sensitive election periods — starting with European Parliament polls in May 2019.\nReceive 4 weeks of unlimited digital access to the Financial Times for just $1 .\nA letter from Sir Julian to Mariya Gabriel, commissioner for the digital economy, calls for more transparency on the internal algorithms that internet platforms use to promote stories, limits on the \"harvesting\" of personal information for political purposes, and disclosure by tech companies of who funds \"sponsored content\" on their websites.\nSir Julian proposes a \"more binding approach\" than self-regulation, including \"clearly and carefully defined performance indicators\".\nshow chapters Trump defends Sinclair Broadcast Group after 'fake news' speeches by local anchors      10 Hours Ago | 01:26 His proposals have backing from the other commissioners who are drawing up the EU's first policy on how to fight \"online disinformation\" to be published later this month.\nThe Cambridge Analytica revelations have turbo-charged the debate, with EU officials pushing for stronger guidance on how platforms should behave to safeguard democracy.\nThe \"psychometric targeting activities\" such as those of Cambridge Analytica, a data analysis company, are just a \"preview of the profoundly disturbing effects such disinformation could have on the functioning of liberal democracies\", Sir Julian wrote in the letter dated March 19.\n\"It is clear that the cyber-security threat we are facing is changing from one primarily targeting systems to one that is also increasingly about deploying cyber means to manipulate behaviour, deepen societal divides, subvert our democratic systems and raise questions about our democratic institutions,\" the letter adds.\nBrussels' warning comes as a number of EU member states are drawing up \"anti-fake news laws\" amid a host of allegations over Russian interference in European elections in the past year.\nFrance is preparing legislation to allow its judges to remove and block false viral content during national election campaigns. Emmanuel Macron, French president, has railed against the \"defamatory untruths\" and \"deceitful propaganda\" of Kremlin-backed media organisations such as RT and Sputnik, which both have French-language websites.\nshow chapters News Guard tackling 'fake news' epidemic      11:49 AM ET Mon, 12 March 2018 | 03:02 Earlier this year, Germany introduced it first \"hate speech law\" that forces platforms to quickly remove terrorist content, xenophobia and fake news or face fines of up to €50m.\nEU officials are worried that next year's European elections will be hijacked by populist and eurosceptic forces using platforms to spread conspiracy theories, false news and doctored videos.\nAn EU-wide survey last month found that more than a third of European citizens came across fake news every day, with 83 per cent saying it was a threat to democracy, according to Eurobarometer.\nBut critics of the commission's approach say it could backfire if the EU ends up shutting down legitimate debate — or is successfully portrayed by its opponents as doing so.\nMarietje Schaake, a liberal European Parliament member who focuses on digital governance, said there was a strong argument for tougher disclosure rules for \"black box\" algorithms and website owners whose anonymity meant they had \"zero accountability\". But she also warned of the potential for the wider online crackdown to backfire if it was seen an attempt by the EU to curb criticism. \"It does put a spotlight on speech,\" she said. \"You have to wonder if that's something desirable.\"\n\nMore from the Financial Times:\nSwiss bankers' hopes for EU access dashed by Brexit\nTrump threatens Nafta in immigration spat with Mexico\nFrance set for rail strikes as unions test Macron's resolve \nWATCH: Fake news catches fire in India as the country sees YouTube for first time show chapters \"Fake news\" and hoaxes catch fire in India as millions see YouTube for the first time      4:10 PM ET Mon, 12 March 2018 | 01:01",
