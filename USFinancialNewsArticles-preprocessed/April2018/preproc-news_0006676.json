Tennis - Davis Cup - Quarter Final - Spain vs Germany - Plaza de Toros de Valencia, Valencia, Spain - April 6, 2018 Spain's Rafael Nadal celebrates winning his quarter final match against Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber REUTERS/Heino Kalis \nNadal was swiftly back into   lop-sided contest. Slideshow (4 Images) \nKohlschreiber also went down tamely in the second before putting up more of a fight at the start of the third, but 16-times grand slam winner Nadal kept his foot on the gas and wrapped up the match in two hours and 33 minutes. \n  \nIt seemed plain sailing for Pouille in Genoa after he swept aside Seppi in the opening two sets but the slugfest went the distance after the Italian fought back in front of a passionate home crowd. \nCilic had an easier task in Croatia’s Adriatic resort of Umag, as he breezed past Popko to put the competition’s 2005 winners in the driving seat. \n  Writing by Zoran Milosavljevic in Belgrade; Editng by Toby Davis",
