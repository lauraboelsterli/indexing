    "text": "BILLINGS, Mont. & SPOKANE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- First Interstate BancSystem, Inc. (“First Interstate”) (NASDAQ: FIBK) and Northwest Bancorporation, Inc. (“Northwest”) (OTC Pink: NBCT) today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which First Interstate, parent company of First Interstate Bank, will acquire Northwest, parent company of Inland Northwest Bank (“INB”), in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $160.9 million in aggregate, or $21.03 per share. The transaction complements First Interstate’s footprint, which successfully expanded from the Mountain West to the Pacific Northwest with the completion of the Cascade Bancorp acquisition in May 2017, and provides First Interstate with a presence in several high-growth markets, including Spokane, Washington, Portland, Oregon and Coeur d’Alene, Idaho.\nINB is a customer-focused community bank based in Spokane, Washington with $826.8 million of assets, $669.0 million in loans, $721.0 million in deposits and $81.7 million in shareholders’ equity with 20 banking offices across Washington, Idaho and Oregon. First Interstate intends to continue operating all 20 of the banking offices. After completion of the acquisition, First Interstate will have approximately $13.1 billion in total assets, $8.3 billion in total loans, $10.7 billion in total deposits, $1.5 billion in shareholders’ equity and 146 banking offices.\n“We are very excited about this acquisition. Our partnership with INB supplements and accelerates our expansion into the Pacific Northwest. More importantly, we believe INB’s customer focus and community bank model align very well with our culture and approach to banking,” said Kevin Riley, First Interstate President and Chief Executive Officer. “Since expanding into Idaho, Oregon, and Washington in 2017, we have a tremendous respect and enthusiasm for these communities and markets. We’re eager to deepen our presence and build relationships with the clients who call these beautiful regions home,” continued Mr. Riley.\n“INB’s growth and momentum spurred First Interstate’s interest in us, and, consequently, a tremendous opportunity for our combined company to expand our presence throughout the Pacific Northwest. First Interstate is the ideal partner because we share values about community banking and how we serve our employees, customers and communities,” said Russ Lee, President and Chief Executive Officer of Northwest. “We are confident that, together, we will deliver a high standard of excellence, continue to value our relationships in each of our communities, and generate strong returns for our shareholders, many of whom have supported INB since it was founded almost 30 years ago.”\nPursuant to the terms of the definitive merger agreement, Northwest shareholders will receive 0.516 shares of First Interstate Class A common stock in exchange for each share of Northwest common stock they hold. The exchange ratio is fixed and the shares received by Northwest shareholders are expected to qualify as a tax-free exchange. Northwest shareholders will own approximately 6% of First Interstate once the transaction is complete.\nFirst Interstate expects the transaction will result in annual earnings per share (EPS) accretion of 3% in 2019. First Interstate is expected to recover the minimal tangible book value dilution experienced in this transaction in under two years.\nThe boards of directors of each company have unanimously approved the transaction and the directors and executive officers of Northwest have entered into agreements with First Interstate, pursuant to which they have agreed to vote their shares of Northwest common stock in favor of the transaction.\nFirst Interstate and Northwest expect to close the transaction late in the third or early in the fourth quarter of 2018, after satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the approval of the Northwest shareholders. It is anticipated that Inland Northwest Bank will be merged with and into First Interstate Bank in connection with the scheduled data processing conversion.\nSandler O’Neill & Partners, L.P. served as financial advisor and Luse Gorman, PC served as legal counsel to First Interstate. D.A. Davidson & Co. served as financial advisor and Witherspoon Kelley served as legal counsel to Northwest.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nFirst Interstate management will review additional information regarding the transaction in the conference call beginning at 11 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, April 26, 2018.

Any statements about First Interstate’s or the combined company’s plans, objectives, expectations, strategies, beliefs, or future performance or events constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are identified as those that include words or phrases such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “trend,” “objective,” “continue,” or similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “might,” “may,” or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions, estimates, and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any results, performance, or events expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements include but are not limited to statements about the benefits of the business combination transaction involving First Interstate and Northwest, including future financial and operating results, the combined company’s plans, objectives, expectations and intentions, and other statements that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, including but not limited to the following: the possibility that the merger does not close when expected or at all because required regulatory, shareholder, or other approvals and other conditions to closing are not received or satisfied on a timely basis or at all; the risk that the benefits from the transaction may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected, including as a result of changes in general economic and market conditions, interest and exchange rates, monetary policy, laws and regulations and their enforcement, and the degree of competition in the geographic and business areas in which First Interstate and Northwest operate; the ability to promptly and effectively integrate the businesses of First Interstate Bank and INB; the reaction of the companies’ customers, employees, and counterparties to the transaction; and the diversion of management time on merger-related issues.\nThese factors are not necessarily all of the factors that could cause First Interstate’s or the combined company’s actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by any of the forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm First Interstate’s or the combined company’s results.\nAll forward-looking statements attributable to First Interstate’s, Northwest’s, or the combined company’s or persons acting on First Interstate’s or Northwest’s behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements set forth above.
