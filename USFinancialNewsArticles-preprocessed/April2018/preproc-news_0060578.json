At March 31, 2018, CUBI Common Stock Was Trading at 134.1% of Tangible Book Value (a Non-GAAP Measure).\nWYOMISSING, Pa., April 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Customers Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE:CUBI), the parent company of Customers Bank (collectively “Customers”), reported net income to common shareholders of $20.5 million for the first quarter of 2018 (\"Q1 2018\") compared to $22.1 million for the first quarter of 2017 (\"Q1 2017\"), a decrease of $1.6 million, or 7.3%, and $18.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 (\"Q4 2017\"), an increase of $2.5 million, or 14.0%. Fully diluted earnings per common share for Q1 2018 was $0.64 compared to $0.67 for Q1 2017, a decrease of $0.03, or 4%, and $0.55 for Q4 2017, an increase of $0.09, or 16%. There were no notable items in Q1 2018. Q4 2017 results included a deferred tax asset re-measurement charge to income tax expense of $5.5 million ($0.17 per diluted share) as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 in December 2017 and a $7.3 million benefit ($0.23 per diluted share) from exercises of employee stock options, principally by Customers' CEO, and vesting of restricted stock units. Q1 2017 included $6.1 million of tax benefits for the vesting of restricted shares and stock option exercises and the adoption of a new tax strategy (a $0.19 per diluted share benefit) and a $1.7 million impairment loss on securities ($0.05 per diluted share cost).\n“The core Community Business Banking segment, the continuing business of Customers once the BankMobile spin-off has been completed, generated earnings of $21.5 million, a 13.9% increase from the Q1 2017 adjusted Community Business Banking segment earnings (a non-GAAP measure). The segment earned a 1.0% return on average assets ('ROAA'), which we expect to move closer to our 1.1% target through year-end as we focus on managing expenses and bolstering net interest margin through loan pricing discipline, and an expected favorable funding mix shift. The Community Business Banking segment is currently on track to achieve earnings within our guided range of $2.75 to $3.00 for the year,\" stated Jay Sidhu, CEO and Chairman of Customers Bank. \"Additionally, we remain focused and on target with our plans to divest BankMobile, build capital, and strengthen performance at the Community Business Banking segment, which we believe will drive above average shareholder value.”\nOutlook\n“Last quarter, Customers decided to provide more guidance for 2018 to provide greater transparency given the expected divestiture of BankMobile and impact of tax reform,\" stated Mr. Sidhu.\nCustomers expects a more moderate pace of asset growth through the remainder of 2018, with an emphasis on shifting from lower yielding to higher yielding assets. The Community Business Banking segment is expected to grow total assets approximately 10% to 15% in 2018. The full year net interest margin will likely be at the low end of the targeted 2.70% to 2.80% range. The efficiency ratio for the Community Business Banking segment in 2018 is expected to be in the mid to high 40%s with fee income of approximately $35 million to $40 million. We estimate an effective consolidated tax rate of approximately 24% for 2018. Customers expects to earn diluted EPS of $2.75 to $3.00 from the Community Business Banking segment, our core franchise which will remain as our continuing business after the spin-off and merger have been completed.\nCustomers expects to complete the divestiture of BankMobile in Q3 2018. BankMobile’s business is seasonal, and the full year earnings impact of BankMobile on Customers' results of operations will depend on the exact time of divestiture; however, it is currently Customers’ expectation that BankMobile's segment results will be no more than a $4.0 million loss per quarter until its divestiture.\nStrategic Priorities\nEnd 2018 With Capital Ratios Around 2017 Levels\nTotal shareholders' equity at March 31, 2018 decreased slightly from December 31, 2017 to $919.1 million as unrealized fair value losses on debt securities resulting from higher interest rates more than offset earnings retained in the quarter, which had a negative impact on our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio (a non-GAAP measure). The estimated total risk-based capital ratio was approximately 12.55% for Q1 2018 compared to 13.1% for Q4 2017. The estimated common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was approximately 8.51% for Q1 2018 compared to 8.81% for Q4 2017. The estimated Tier 1 leverage capital ratio was approximately 9.03% for Q1 2018 compared to 8.94% for Q4 2017. The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio (a non-GAAP measure) was approximately 6.36% at March 31, 2018 compared to 7.00% at December 31, 2017.\nCustomers recognizes the importance of not only being well capitalized in the current regulatory environment but to have adequate capital buffers to absorb any unexpected shocks. \"As we expected, our capital ratios declined in Q1 2018 as we purchased securities and mortgage warehouse balances increased,\" stated Mr. Sidhu. \"We continue to target a Tier I leverage capital ratio of 9.0% or higher and a total risk-based capital ratio of around 13.0% by the end of this year,\" Mr. Sidhu continued. \"We expect capital ratios to remain below target through the middle of the year, given growth in the mortgage warehouse business, but then improve in the fourth quarter,\" concluded Mr. Sidhu.\nGrow and Successfully Divest BankMobile in Third Quarter 2018\nBankMobile operates a branchless digital bank offering very low cost banking services to its 1.1 million active deposit customers. Deposit balances were approximately $623.6 million at March 31, 2018, including approximately $619.4 million of non-interest bearing deposit accounts.\nDuring Q1 2018, the BankMobile segment reported net interest income of $4.4 million, non-interest income of $12.5 million, operating expenses of $17.9 million, provision for loan losses of $0.2 million and a tax benefit of $0.3 million from the operating losses, resulting in a net loss of $1.0 million. The BankMobile segment results include the funds transfer pricing benefit received by the segment for the originated deposits in the segment reporting results at a rate of approximately 2.8%. Deposits generated by the BankMobile business averaged $644 million for Q1 2018 and $794 million for Q1 2017.\nDuring Q3 2017, Customers decided that the best strategy for its shareholders for divesting BankMobile was to spin-off BankMobile to Customers’ shareholders subject to an agreement with Flagship Community Bank (\"Flagship\") for Flagship to acquire the BankMobile business. The transactions are expected to be completed in Q3 2018. Flagship has filed an application with the FDIC for its acquisition of BankMobile’s deposits.\nCustomers expects to shortly file an initial, confidential version of its Form 10 registration statement with the SEC with respect to the spin-off and the distribution of BankMobile Technologies, Inc. common stock to Customers’ shareholders. Customers expects a public version of the filing to be made closer to the spin-off date in accordance with SEC rules. Once approvals of the transactions and filings are received from the FDIC and SEC as appropriate, Customers will announce the record date for the distribution of BankMobile Technologies, Inc. shares to Customers' shareholders. Following the spin-off of BankMobile from Customers and merger of BankMobile with Flagship, Customers and Flagship/BankMobile will be entirely separate entities. Customers will retain no ownership in BankMobile, there will be no common employees, facilities, or functions beyond certain temporary support services to BankMobile according to the terms of a transition services agreement and one common director. Following the spin-off and merger, Customers' shareholders are to receive ownership of over 50% of Flagship common shares in what is expected to be a tax-free transaction.\nGrow and Improve Financial Performance of the Community Business Banking Segment\nPriorities for the Community Business Banking segment in 2018 include strong risk management, core deposit growth, a focus on net interest margin, and carefully managed credit risk. Customers is targeting an ROAA of approximately 1.10% and a return on tangible common equity (\"ROTCE\") (a non-GAAP measure) greater than 12%. Longer term, Customers is targeting a net interest margin between 2.80% to 3.00%, a compound annual growth rate (\"CAGR\") of 15% in EPS, and an efficiency ratio in the low 40%s.\nIn Q1 2018, the Community Business Banking segment reported net income of $21.5 million ($0.67 per diluted share), which included the funds transfer pricing cost paid by the segment for use of BankMobile’s deposits at a rate of approximately 2.8% of those deposits. For Q1 2018, the segment reported an ROAA of 1.00%, ROTCE of 13.1% (a non-GAAP measure) and an efficiency ratio of 49.7%, compared to the respective Q1 2017 metrics of 1.03%, 12.8% and 46.2%.\nCredit quality at Customers Bank is very strong, as measured by the low level of net charge-offs (3 basis points of average loans on an annualized basis in Q1 2018) and nonperforming loans (0.26% of total loans at March 31, 2018). Customers' lower than peer credit risk appetite is also reflected in below average asset yields and a narrower net interest margin.\nCustomers' deposit strategy is to look at the total cost of deposits as the sum of operating and interest costs. Customers’ branch light model, with a focus on cost control, is reflected in dramatically lower operating expenses than the industry - operating expenses in the Community Business Banking segment were equal to 1.36% of average assets in Q1 2018, which we believe is over 125 basis points lower than the industry overall, and enables us to pay a somewhat higher than peer interest rate. Core deposit growth is a strategic priority for Customers. Of note, excluding BankMobile deposits, the Community Business Banking segment grew non-interest bearing demand deposits by 26.4% in Q1 2018 from Q1 2017 to $641 million. In 2018, Customers is developing new deposit products and incentives to support our drive to grow low cost core deposits.\nQ1 2018 Overview\nThe following table presents a summary of key earnings and performance metrics for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and the preceding four quarters, respectively:\nCUSTOMERS BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES EARNINGS SUMMARY - UNAUDITED (Dollars in thousands, except per-share data) Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 2018 2017 2017 2017 2017 Net income available to common shareholders $ 20,527 $ 18,000 $ 4,139 $ 20,107 $ 22,132 Basic earnings per common share (\"EPS\") $ 0.65 $ 0.58 $ 0.13 $ 0.66 $ 0.73 Diluted EPS $ 0.64 $ 0.55 $ 0.13 $ 0.62 $ 0.67 Average common shares outstanding - basic 31,424,496 30,843,319 30,739,671 30,641,554 30,407,060 Average common shares outstanding - diluted 32,273,973 32,508,030 32,512,692 32,569,652 32,789,160 Shares outstanding period end 31,466,271 31,382,503 30,787,632 30,730,784 30,636,327 Return on average assets 0.95 % 0.84 % 0.29 % 0.93 % 1.09 % Return on average common equity 11.73 % 10.11 % 2.33 % 11.84 % 13.80 % Net interest margin, tax equivalent (1) 2.67 % 2.79 % 2.62 % 2.78 % 2.73 % Efficiency ratio 60.84 % 62.42 % 68.55 % 58.15 % 56.82 % Non-performing loans (NPLs) to total loans (including held-for-sale loans) 0.26 % 0.30 % 0.33 % 0.21 % 0.33 % Reserves to non-performing loans 173.02 % 146.36 % 130.83 % 204.59 % 149.85 % Net charge-offs $ 633 $ 1,130 $ 2,495 $ 1,960 $ 482 Annualized net charge-offs to average total loans 0.03 % 0.05 % 0.11 % 0.09 % 0.02 % Tier 1 capital to average assets (leverage ratio) (2) 9.03 % 8.94 % 8.35 % 8.66 % 9.04 % Common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets (2) 8.51 % 8.81 % 8.28 % 8.28 % 8.51 % Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets (2) 11.11 % 11.58 % 10.94 % 10.96 % 11.35 % Total capital to risk-weighted assets (2) 12.55 % 13.05 % 12.40 % 12.43 % 12.99 % Tangible common equity to tangible assets (3) 6.36 % 7.00 % 6.47 % 6.21 % 6.52 % Book value per common share $ 22.30 $ 22.42 $ 22.51 $ 22.54 $ 21.62 Tangible book value per common share (period end) (4) $ 21.74 $ 21.90 $ 21.98 $ 21.97 $ 21.04 Period end stock price $ 29.15 $ 25.99 $ 32.62 $ 28.28 $ 31.53 (1) Non-GAAP measure calculated as GAAP net interest income, plus tax equivalent interest using a 26% rate for Q1 2018, and a 35% rate for Q1 2017 to Q4 2017, divided by average interest earning assets. (2) Regulatory capital ratios are estimated for Q1 2018. (3) Non-GAAP measure calculated as GAAP total shareholders' equity less preferred stock and goodwill and other intangibles divided by total assets less goodwill and other intangibles. (4) Non-GAAP measure calculated as GAAP total shareholders' equity less preferred stock and goodwill and other intangibles divided by common shares outstanding at period end. Net interest income\nQ1 2018 net interest income of $65.0 million increased $2.6 million, or 4.2%, from Q1 2017 as average interest earning assets increased $0.6 billion, or 6.6%, and the net interest margin narrowed 6 basis points to 2.67%. Q1 2018 net interest income of $65.0 million decreased $3.3 million, or 4.8%, from Q4 2017 as the $122.2 million, or 1.25% increase in average earning assets was more than offset by a 12 basis point reduction in net interest margin to 2.67%.\n\"The sequential quarter net interest margin compression was principally caused by lower prepayment penalty income and shifts in our balance sheet mix as we replaced securities sold last year,\" said Mr. Sidhu. The reduction in loan prepayments accounted for approximately 6 basis points of the 12 basis points sequential compression, and totaled $0.6 million in Q1 2018, compared to $2.1 million in Q4 2017. \"Excluding prepayment income and balance sheet mix shifts, we estimate 2-3 basis points of core margin compression, as the increase in loan yields excluding prepayments benefited net interest margin by about 8 basis points, which was more than offset by approximately 10 basis points of margin pressure from higher funding costs. Customers' objective is to manage interest rate sensitivity to about a neutral position, not speculating on whether interest rates go up or down. We will continue to focus on loan pricing and remixing our assets and as we work to strengthen core deposit funding to combat margin pressure,\" concluded Mr. Sidhu.\nTotal loans outstanding, including commercial loans held for sale, increased $111 million, or 1.28%, to $8.8 billion as of March 31, 2018 compared to total loans of $8.7 billion as of December 31, 2017. Commercial and industrial loans increased $66 million to $1.6 billion, up 4.1% over December 31, 2017. Commercial loans to mortgage companies increased $87 million to $1.9 billion, an increase of 4.7% over December 31, 2017 reflecting typical seasonality. Multi-family loans were flat at $3.6 billion compared to December 31, 2017. Commercial non-owner-occupied real estate loans decreased $23 million to $1.2 billion, down 1.9% from December 31, 2017. Reflecting Q4 2017 loan sales, consumer loans decreased $12 million to $0.3 billion and make up less than 4% of the loan portfolio.\nTotal deposits increased by $242 million, or 3.6%, to $7.0 billion as of March 31, 2018 compared to total deposits of $6.8 billion as of December 31, 2017. Non-interest bearing demand deposit accounts increased by $209 million, or 19.8%, to $1.3 billion reflecting favorable seasonal trend at BankMobile. Interest bearing demand deposit accounts decreased $13 million to $510 million, money market deposit accounts increased $66 million to $3.3 billion, and certificates of deposit accounts decreased $17 million to $1.9 billion.\nProvision and Credit\nCustomers’ Q1 2018 provision for loan losses totaled $2.1 million compared to a provision expense of $3.1 million in Q1 2017. The Q1 2018 provision expense included $0.9 million for loan portfolio growth and $1.3 million for specifically identified loans, offset in part by a $0.2 million release resulting from improved asset quality and lower incurred losses than previously estimated. Net charge-offs for Q1 2018 were $0.6 million, compared to Q1 2017 net charge-offs of $0.5 million. There were no significant changes in Customers' methodology for estimating the allowance for loan losses in Q1 2018.\nRisk management is a critical component of how Customers creates long-term shareholder value, and Customers believes that asset quality is one of the most important risks in banking to be understood and managed. Customers believes that asset quality risks must be diligently addressed during good economic times with prudent underwriting standards so that when the economy deteriorates the bank's capital is sufficient to absorb all losses without threatening its ability to operate and serve its community and other constituents. \"Customers' non-performing loans at March 31, 2018 were only 0.26% of total loans, compared to our peer group non-performing loans of approximately 0.80% in the most recent period available, and industry average non-performing loans of 1.30% in the most recent period available. Our expectation is superior asset quality performance in good times and in difficult years,\" said Mr. Sidhu.\nNon-interest income\nNon-interest income increased $2.7 million (up 14.7%) in Q1 2018 to $20.9 million compared to Q4 2017, but was $1.0 million (down 4.5%) below Q1 2017. The modest decline from the year ago period was largely a result of decreases in BankMobile's interchange and card revenue of $3.0 million and deposit fees of $1.0 million, offset in part by increases in miscellaneous fee income of $1.0 million, primarily from commercial leases, as well as a Q1 2017 other-than-temporary impairment charges on investment securities of $1.7 million.\nNon-interest expense\nNon-interest expenses totaled $52.3 million, an increase of $3.8 million from Q1 2017, or 7.8%. Salaries and employee benefits increased $3.8 million as Customers continues to hire new team members in the markets it serves. Technology, communication, and bank operations increased $0.9 million, largely the result of our continued investment in our BankMobile segment infrastructure. These increases were partially offset by decreases in professional services of $1.5 million. The Community Business Banking segment's non-interest expenses, which exclude the effect of BankMobile, increased by $4.2 million in Q1 2018 when compared to Q1 2017 primarily as a result of increased salaries and employee benefits of $3.1 million mainly due to salary increases and increased headcount.\nThe Q1 2018 efficiency ratio was 60.8% compared to the Q1 2017 efficiency ratio of 56.8%. The Q1 2018 efficiency ratio for the Community Business Banking segment was 49.7% compared to the Q1 2017 efficiency ratio of 46.2% for the segment.\nTax\nThe provision for income tax expense for Q1 2018 was $7.4 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 23.5%, compared to 21.4% in Q1 2017 and 33.3% in Q4 2017. In Q1 2017, Customers recorded a $6.1 million tax benefit related to the vesting of restricted shares and exercises of employee stock options, and the adoption of a tax strategy to capture the benefit of certain securities losses that reduced the 2017 effective tax rate to 21.4%. In Q4 2017, Customers recorded a deferred tax asset re-measurement charge to its income tax expense of $5.5 million ($0.17 per diluted share) as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 in December 2017. This adjustment was offset by the tax benefit recognized in Q4 2017 of $7.3 million ($0.23 per diluted share) resulting from exercises of employee stock options and vesting of restricted stock units. Customers currently estimates a 2018 effective tax rate of approximately 24.0%.\nProfitability\nCustomers' return on average assets was 0.95% in Q1 2018 compared to 1.09% in Q1 2017, and its return on average common equity was 11.73% in Q1 2018 compared to 13.80% in Q1 2017. The return on average assets for the Community Business Banking Segment was 1.00%, compared to 1.03% in Q1 2017.\nManaging Commercial Real Estate Concentration Risks and Providing High Net Worth Families Loans for Their Multi-Family Holdings\nCustomers' total commercial real estate (\"CRE\") loan exposures subject to regulatory concentration guidelines of $4.8 billion as of March 31, 2018 included construction loans of $92.9 million, multi-family loans of $3.6 billion, and non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans of $1.1 billion, which represent 409% of total risk-based capital on a combined basis, a reduction from 418% as of December 31, 2017. Customers' loans subject to regulatory CRE concentration guidelines had 3 year cumulative growth of 61% in Q1 2018, a deceleration from 112% in Q1 2017.\nRecognizing the risks that accompany certain elements of commercial real estate lending, Customers has studiously sought to manage risk and has concluded that it has appropriate risk management systems in place to manage this portfolio. Customers' total real estate construction and development exposure, arguably the riskiest area of CRE, was only $92.9 million at March 31, 2018, less than 10% of total risk-based capital.\nCustomers' loans collateralized by multi-family properties were approximately 307% of total risk-based capital at March 31, 2018. Customers' multi-family exposures are focused principally on loans to high net worth families collateralized by multi-family properties that are of modest size and subject to what Customers believes are conservative underwriting standards. Customers believes it has a strong risk management process to manage the portfolio risks prospectively and that this portfolio will perform well even under a stressed scenario. Following are some key characteristics of Customers' multi-family loan portfolio:\nPrincipally concentrated in New York City with an emphasis on properties subject to some type of rent control; and principally to high net worth families; Average loan size is $6.9 million; Median annual debt service coverage ratio is 137%; Median loan-to-value for the portfolio is 66.8%; All loans are individually stressed with an increase of 1% and 2% to the cap rate and an increase of 1.5% and 3% in loan interest rates; All properties are inspected prior to a loan being granted and monitored thereafter on an annual basis by dedicated portfolio managers; and Credit approval process is independent of customer sales and portfolio management process.\nConference Call Date: Monday, April 30, 2018 Time: 11:00 AM ET US Dial-in: 800-310-6649 International Dial-in: 719-457-1083 Participant Code: 610980 Please dial in at least 10 minutes before the start of the call to ensure timely participation.

These non-GAAP financial measures exclude from corresponding GAAP measures the impact of certain elements that we do not believe are representative of our financial results, which we believe enhance an overall understanding of our performance. Investors should consider our performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing our performance or financial condition. Although non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations or financial condition as reported under GAAP.\nThe following tables present reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP measures disclosed within this document.\nAdjusted Net Income to Common Shareholders - Community Business Banking Segment Only Q1 2018 Q4 2017 Q3 2017 Q2 2017 Q1 2017 USD Per share USD Per share USD Per share USD Per share USD Per share GAAP net income to common shareholders $ 21,528 $ 0.67 $ 22,240 $ 0.68 $ 11,047 $ 0.34 $ 23,640 $ 0.73 $ 20,675 $ 0.63 Reconciling items (after tax): Loss of deferred tax asset for Religare impairment — — — — 4,898 0.15 — — — — Religare impairment - excluding loss of deferred tax asset considered above — — — — 8,036 0.25 1,758 0.05 (1,786 ) (0.05 ) Gains on investment securities (10 ) — (170 ) — (3,356 ) (0.10 ) (1,942 ) (0.06 ) — — Adjusted net income to common shareholders $ 21,518 $ 0.67 $ 22,070 $ 0.68 $ 20,625 $ 0.64 $ 23,456 $ 0.72 $ 18,889 $ 0.58\nReturn on Tangible Common Equity - Community Business Banking Segment Only Q1 2018 Q1 2017 GAAP net income to common shareholders $ 21,528 $ 20,675 Total shareholder's equity 887,192 878,114 Reconciling Items: Preferred stock (217,471 ) (217,471 ) Goodwill & other intangibles (3,630 ) (3,636 ) Tangible common equity $ 666,091 $ 657,007 Return on tangible common equity 13.11 % 12.76 %\nNet Interest Margin, tax equivalent Q1 2018 Q4 2017 Q3 2017 Q2 2017 Q1 2017 GAAP Net interest income $ 65,031 $ 68,300 $ 68,019 $ 68,606 $ 62,418 Tax-equivalent adjustment 171 245 203 104 93 Net interest income tax equivalent $ 65,202 $ 68,545 $ 68,222 $ 68,710 $ 62,511 Average total interest earning assets $ 9,881,220 $ 9,758,987 $ 10,352,394 $ 9,893,785 $ 9,266,639 Net interest margin, tax equivalent 2.67 % 2.79 % 2.62 % 2.78 % 2.73 %\nTangible Common Equity to Tangible Assets Q1 2018 Q4 2017 Q3 2017 Q2 2017 Q1 2017 GAAP - Total Shareholders' Equity $ 919,088 $ 920,964 $ 910,642 $ 910,289 $ 879,817 Reconciling Items: Preferred Stock (217,471 ) (217,471 ) (217,471 ) (217,471 ) (217,471 ) Goodwill and Other Intangibles (17,477 ) (16,295 ) (16,604 ) (17,615 ) (17,618 ) Tangible Common Equity $ 684,140 $ 687,198 $ 676,567 $ 675,203 $ 644,728 Total Assets $ 10,769,266 $ 9,839,555 $ 10,471,829 $ 10,883,548 $ 9,906,636 Reconciling Items: Goodwill and Other Intangibles (17,477 ) (16,295 ) (16,604 ) (17,615 ) (17,618 ) Tangible Assets $ 10,751,789 $ 9,823,260 $ 10,455,225 $ 10,865,933 $ 9,889,018 Tangible Common Equity to Tangible Assets 6.36 % 7.00 % 6.47 % 6.21 % 6.52 %\nTangible Book Value per Common Share Q1 2018 Q4 2017 Q3 2017 Q2 2017 Q1 2017 GAAP - Total Shareholders' Equity $ 919,088 $ 920,964 $ 910,642 $ 910,289 $ 879,817 Reconciling Items: Preferred Stock (217,471 ) (217,471 ) (217,471 ) (217,471 ) (217,471 ) Goodwill and Other Intangibles (17,477 ) (16,295 ) (16,604 ) (17,615 ) (17,618 ) Tangible Common Equity $ 684,140 $ 687,198 $ 676,567 $ 675,203 $ 644,728 Common shares outstanding 31,466,271 31,382,503 30,787,632 30,730,784 30,636,327 Tangible Book Value per Common Share $ 21.74 $ 21.90 $ 21.98 $ 21.97 $ 21.04 Contacts:\nJay Sidhu, Chairman & CEO 610-935-8693\nRobert Wahlman, CFO 610-743-8074\nBob Ramsey, Director of Investor Relations and Strategic Planning 484-926-7118\nSource:Customers Bancorp, Inc",
