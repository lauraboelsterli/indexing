Ultimately the campus will total approximately 400,000 square feet.\n\"Stream's DFW VII data center will follow a successful formula from our previous Dallas-area developments and benefit from the best practices and improvements we've made along the way,\" states Paul Moser, Co-Managing Partner of Stream Data Centers.\nStream Data Centers' new DFW campus development will feature:\nA 22.66 acre site in Garland, Texas located on Lookout Drive, in close proximity to robust Northeast Dallas, Richardson and Garland amenities, power and fiber infrastructure.
