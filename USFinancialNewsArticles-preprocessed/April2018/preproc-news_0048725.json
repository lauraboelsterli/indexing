    "text": "BEIJING, Sogou Inc. (NYSE: SOGO) (\"Sogou\" or \"the Company\"), an innovator in search and a leader in China's internet industry, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter 2018, ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nTotal revenues 1 were $248.4 million, a 53% increase year-over-year. Net income attributable to Sogou Inc. was $15.3 million, a 25% increase year-over-year. Non-GAAP 2 net income attributable to Sogou Inc. was $19.6 million, a 56% increase year-over-year.\n\"We continued to make progress with our 'twin-engine' growth strategy, centered on core search and mobile keyboard,\" said Xiaochuan Wang, CEO of Sogou. \"We posted healthy business growth with core search revenues growing more than 50% year-on-year, as we expanded our unique content in key verticals such as healthcare and education, further differentiating our search services. Sogou Mobile Keyboard continued to gain traction through the quarter with the addition of a further 30 million daily active users, taking the total DAU to 362 million, each of whom spends an average of one hour a day using the app. This creates a solid foundation for us to provide the information and services that our users value.\"\nMr. Wang added, \"We remain focused on language-centered AI technologies, including translation, voice and computer vision, which enable us to continuously optimize our core products. Leveraging our proprietary machine translation technology, we launched the Sogou Smart Travel Translator, which became a bestseller among peer products. In voice technology, Sogou Mobile Keyboard processed an average of 280 million voice requests per day, making it the largest voice application in China. In computer vision, we are applying advanced algorithm-based models to Sogou Mobile Keyboard and our smart translation devices, further improving their accuracy in recognizing text embedded in images. We are confident that our focused AI roadmap will drive sustainable business growth.\"\nJoe Zhou, CFO of Sogou, said, \"We started 2018 with a solid set of financial results, beating the top end of our revenue guidance and posting a healthy bottom line with non-GAAP net income up 56% year-over-year. With our investments in AI showing long-term promise, and our healthy balance sheet and cash position, we will continue to invest in content, data and technology to capture future market opportunities.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenues were $248.4 million, a 53% increase year-over-year.\nSearch and search-related revenues 3 were $220.4 million, a 55% increase year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to strong growth in auction-based pay-for-click services , driven by continued traffic growth and improved monetization in mobile search. Auction-based pay-for-click services accounted for 82.6% of search and search-related revenues, compared to 80.5% in the corresponding period in 2017. Other revenues were $28.0 million, a 38% increase year-over-year. The growth was primarily due to increased revenues from sales of smart hardware products and Internet value-added services (or \"IVAS\").\nCost of revenues was $154.0 million, a 76% increase year-over-year. Traffic acquisition cost , a primary driver of cost of revenues, was $111.9 million, a 94% increase year-over-year, representing 45.1% of total revenues, compared to 35.6% in the corresponding period in 2017.\nGross profit was $94.4 million, a 26% increase year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross profit was $94.6 million, a 26% increase year-over-year.\nTotal operating expenses were $80.1 million, a 28% increase year-over-year.\nResearch and development expenses were $46.6 million, a 41% increase year-over-year, representing 18.8% of total revenues, compared to 20.4% in the corresponding period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in salary and benefits expenses, share based compensation expenses as well as outsourced product development fees, reflecting our continued efforts to strengthen our AI capabilities. Sales and marketing expenses were $27.1 million, a 9% increase year-over-year, representing 10.9% of total revenues, compared to 15.3% in the corresponding period in 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in both salary and benefits expenses for our sales and marketing staff and marketing and promotional spend for our mobile products. General and administrative expenses were $6.4 million, a 38% increase year-over-year, representing 2.6% of total revenues, compared to 2.9% in the corresponding period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in professional service fees.\nOperating income was $14.3 million, a 16% increase year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income was $18.5 million, a 47% increase year-over-year.\nIncome tax expense was $2.1 million, compared to an income tax expense of $1.1 million in the corresponding quarter of 2017.\nNet income attributable to Sogou Inc. was $15.3 million, a 25% increase year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Sogou Inc. was $19.6 million, a 56% increase year-over-year.\nBasic and diluted earnings per ADS were $0.04. Non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS were $0.05.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.1 billion, compared with $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2017. Net operating cash inflow for the first quarter of 2018 was $56.2 million. Capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2018 were $12.5 million.\n[1] On a constant currency (non-GAAP) basis, if the exchange rate in the first quarter of 2018 had been the same as it was in the first quarter of 2017, or RMB6.88=$1.00, total revenues in the first quarter of 2018 would have been $229.6 million, or $18.8 million less than GAAP total revenues, and up 41% year-over-year.\n[2] Non-GAAP results exclude share-based compensation expense. Explanation of the Company's non-GAAP financial measures and related reconciliations to GAAP financial measures are included in the accompanying \"Non-GAAP Disclosure\" and \"Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Results of Operation Measures to the Nearest Comparable GAAP Measures.\"\n[3] The Company has adopted ASU No. 2014-09, ''Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" beginning January 1, 2018. The only major impact of the standard is that revenues and expenses related to advertising barter transactions are recognized beginning January 1, 2018. The impact for this quarter is approximately $6.3 million for both revenues and cost of revenues and expenses.\nBusiness Outlook\nFor the second quarter of 2018, Sogou expects total revenues to range from $295 million to $305 million, representing a 39.8% to 44.6% increase year-over-year.\nFor the second quarter 2018 guidance, the Company has adopted a presumed exchange rate of RMB 6.40 = $1.00, as compared with the actual exchange rate of approximately RMB6.86 = $1.00 for the second quarter of 2017, and RMB 6.36 = $1.00 for the first quarter of 2018.\nNon-GAAP Disclosure\nTo supplement the unaudited consolidated financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), Sogou's management uses non-GAAP measures of gross profit, gross margin, and net income that are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude the impact of share-based awards. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results.\nSogou's management believes that excluding share-based compensation expense is useful for management's internal operating purposes and for investors. The amount of share-based compensation expense cannot be anticipated by management, and these expenses are not built into the Company's annual budgets and quarterly forecasts, which generally will be the basis for information Sogou provides to analysts and investors as guidance for future operating performance. As share-based compensation expense does not involve subsequent cash outflow, Sogou does not factor in this expense when evaluating and approving expenditures or when determining the allocation of its resources to its business operations. As a result, in general, the Company's monthly financial results for internal reporting and any performance measures for commissions and bonuses are based on these non-GAAP financial measures that exclude share-based compensation expense.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of Sogou's current financial performance and prospects for the future. A limitation of using non-GAAP gross profit, gross margin, and net income measures that exclude share-based compensation expense is that share-based compensation expense has been and is likely to continue to be a significant recurring expense in the Company's business. In order to mitigate these limitations, the Company has provided specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure. The accompanying tables include details on the reconciliation between GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to the non-GAAP financial measures the Company has presented.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements. It is currently expected that the Business Outlook will not be updated until release of Sogou's next quarterly earnings announcement. However, Sogou reserves the right to update its Business Outlook at any time for any reason. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about Sogou's and Sogou management's beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements.

We caution you that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.
