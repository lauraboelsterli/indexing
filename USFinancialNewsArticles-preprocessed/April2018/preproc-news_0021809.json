The procession departs after funeral services for radio broadcaster Tyler Bieber, one of the people killed in the crash of a bus carrying the Humboldt Broncos Junior A hockey team, in Humboldt, Saskatchewan, Canada April 12, 2018. REUTERS/Matt Smith \nTyler Bieber, 29, was a radio broadcaster who provided play-by-play calls for the team, the Humboldt Broncos. \nThe first funeral for one of the victims was held at the arena where the team played home games in a town with 6,000 residents. The bus was carrying 29 team players, coaches and others when it collided with a semi-trailer truck. \nThe crash has rocked Canada, where junior hockey teams are championed by local communities and long highway drives are commonplace. \nPeople across Canada wore hockey jerseys on Thursday to honour the Broncos. An online campaign raised almost C$10 million for the affected families.
