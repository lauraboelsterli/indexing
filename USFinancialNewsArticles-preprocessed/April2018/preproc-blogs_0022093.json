    "text": "Argentina books largest U.S. soybean imports in 20 years, USDA says Published 5 Hours Ago Reuters \nCHICAGO, April 10 (Reuters) - Argentina has booked its largest import purchase of U.S. soybeans in 20 years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said, amid a drought that has cut production in the world's No. 3 soybean exporter and top supplier of soymeal and soyoil. \nThe USDA on Tuesday confirmed the private sales of 120,000 tonnes of U.S. soybeans to Argentina for shipment in the 2018/19 marketing year, which begins on Sept. 1. \nThe sale represents the largest volume of U.S. soybeans sold to Argentina, a major soy producer, since December 1997, according to trade data from the U.S. Census Bureau. \nArgentina's worst drought in decades has slashed the country's crop this season. Analysts polled by Reuters ahead of a monthly USDA crop report due later on Tuesday expect Argentine soy output of 42.66 million tonnes, which would be the smallest in six years. \nSoybean futures on the Chicago Board of Trade rallied to open Tuesday's U.S. trading session following the USDA announcement.
