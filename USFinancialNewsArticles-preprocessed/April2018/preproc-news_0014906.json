    "text": "AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Three large pension fund managers said on Friday they had invested 1 billion euros ($1.22 billion) in Madrid-based Globalvia, a transportation infrastructure developer.\nGlobalvia is 40.8 percent owned by the Netherlands’ PGGM, 40.3 percent owned by Canada’s OPTrust, and 18.9 percent owned by Britain’s USS.\nPGGM spokesman Maurice Wilbrink said the 1 billion euros was invested proportionately between the owners.\nGlobalvia has now received 700 million euros in all from PGGM, making it the Dutch fund’s largest infrastructure investment vehicle.\nIn a statement, the funds said Globalvia’s investments in rail and road concessions promise healthy returns and are a good fit with the pension funds’ long-term goals.\nPGGM, with historical links to Dutch healthcare workers, has 218 billion euros in total assets under management.\nReporting by Toby Sterling; Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ",
