    "text": "April 10, 2018 / 1:19 PM / Updated an hour ago Paceman Morkel joins Surrey on two-year contract Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Surrey have signed South Africa fast bowler Morne Morkel on a two-year contract, the former English county champions announced on Tuesday. Cricket - South Africa v Australia - Fourth Test - Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg, South Africa - April 3, 2018 South Africa's Morne Morkel reacts after winning the series REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko \nMorkel quit international cricket after South Africa’s recent 3-1 home test series win over Australia and the 33-year-old will add plenty of experience having played 86 tests, 117 one-day internationals and 44 Twenty20 internationals. \n\"It is a real honour that Surrey have asked me to join their club after my retirement from international cricket,\" Morkel, who has taken 544 wickets across all formats of the game, said in a statement to Surrey's website ( www.kiaoval.com ). \nMorkel will be available for Surrey in all forms of the game as a Kolpak registered player. \nA player becomes eligible for a Kolpak deal when he gives up the right to play for his country and is not classed as an overseas player in country cricket. \n“I’m looking forward to settling into London with my family for the summer, making new friendships with team mates and hopefully great memories on and off the field.” \nSurrey are looking for their first county championship title since 2002 and begin their campaign at home to Hampshire on April 20.
