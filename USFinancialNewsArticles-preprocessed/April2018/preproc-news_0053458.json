    "text": "LONDON, April 26 (Reuters) - Facebook did not intend its behaviour towards the media to be interpreted as trying to stop the truth about a data scandal from coming out, the company’s chief technology officer said on Thursday.\nAsked by a lawmaker on a British parliamentary committee whether Facebook would apologise for its “bullying” behaviour towards the press, Mike Schroepfer said: “I am sorry that journalists feel that we are trying to prevent them from getting the truth out.\n“That is not the intent, so I’m sorry,” he added.
