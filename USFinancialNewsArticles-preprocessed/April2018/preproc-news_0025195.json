    "text": "By David Z. Morris April 14, 2018 \nAs a candidate, Donald Trump sold himself as an isolationist, decrying American involvement in foreign wars – particularly in the Middle East. The day after ordering a 105-missile air strike on Syria, some of Trump’s most passionate supporters, particularly on the far right, are in a kind of mourning over what they see as a profound betrayal of those campaign promises. \nThe backlash shows continued erosion of the Trump coalition, at least among commentators and talking heads, which could have significant implications for the upcoming midterm elections. \nMost prominently, Fox News hosts Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham both appeared skeptical of Trump’s decision. \nIn conversation with former Trump adviser Sebastian Gorka, Ingraham focused on the cost of the strike. “If we have a country that is desperately in debt, and getting weaker and weaker and weaker . . . year after year after year . . . someone is going to have to pay the piper. Two blocks from here we’ve got [lots] of people living out on the street. Many of them are American veterans.” \nHer surprise is understandable, given Trump’s many past statements of opposition to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, such as a 2011 tweet critical of “wasting money” in Afghanistan instead of “rebuild[ing] our country first.” When will we stop wasting our money on rebuilding Afghanistan? We must rebuild our country first. \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2011 \nShaun King of The Intercept , long critical of Trump from the left, seemed momentarily aligned with Ingraham as he detailed the cost of the strike, which he tallied at $224 million. 112 tomahawk missiles launched at Syria. \nEach costs $1.87M to make. \nThat's $224M total.
