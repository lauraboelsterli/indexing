    "text": " 30 p.m. ET Share \nEarly missteps reflect rough transition from CNBC to White House \nBy Nick Timiraos Getty Images Lawrence Kudlow has had a rocky transition from TV commentator to President Trump’s senior economic adviser. \nRiding a van back to Mar-a-Lago after a news conference this week, White House officials told economic adviser Lawrence Kudlow that he had just said something bound to produce some unwanted headlines. \nMr. Kudlow had suggested that Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, suffered “momentary confusion” when she said on TV over the weekend that the U.S. was poised to slap Russia with new sanctions. Ms. Haley hadn’t been told those plans had changed — something Mr. Kudlow didn’t know until later. \nInitially, Mr. Kudlow didn’t believe he had given offense, a White House official recalled. Later, when White House Chief of Staff John Kelly showed him Ms. Haley’s terse response — “With all due respect, I don’t get confused” — Mr. Kudlow quickly called her to apologize. \nBut the dust-up became a diversion during the U.S.-Japan summit that ended on Thursday.",
