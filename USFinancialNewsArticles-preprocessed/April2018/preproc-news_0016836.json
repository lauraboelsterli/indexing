    "text": "KAIYUAN, China (Reuters) - A man in northeastern China who always wanted to own an aircraft is doing the next best thing: building a full-scale replica of an Airbus A320 jet.\nZhu Yue and his friends work to build a full-scale replica of the Airbus A320 plane, in Kaiyuan, Liaoning province, China April 3, 2018. REUTERS/Sheng Li Zhu Yue, an aviation buff who worked as a welder and an auto mechanic, spent months studying plane models and technical drawings before he started building a homemade version a year ago with his friends.\nZhu, 40, who lives in the city of Kaiyuan in Liaoning province, said he planned to turn the replica into an aviation-themed restaurant.\n“I want to make sure the plane is created with finesse and be the best A320 model in China,” he said.\nThe replica - 37.8 metres (124 ft) long with a wingspan of 36 metres (118 ft) and height of 12 metres (39.37 ft) - will feature model engine turbines that can rotate and a simulation cockpit, he added.\nZhu, who has so far spent more than 1 million yuan ($158,810) of his savings and used 40 tonnes of steel on his project, hopes to complete it by the end of year at a total cost of 2 million yuan ($317,620).\n($1=6.2968 Chinese yuan renminbi)\nSlideshow (5 Images) Writing by Florence Lo in BEIJING; Editing by Tony Munroe and Clarence Fernandez\n ",
