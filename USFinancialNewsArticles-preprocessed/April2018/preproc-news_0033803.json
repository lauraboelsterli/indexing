    "text": "DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- New Concept Energy, Inc. (NYSE American: GBR), (the “Company” or “NCE”) a Dallas-based oil and gas company, today reported Results of Operations for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017. During the three months ended December 31, 2017 the Company reported a net loss of $2,851,000 or ($1.39) per share, compared to a net income of $641,000 or $0.32 per share for the same period ended December 31, 2016.\nFor the full year ended December 31, 2017 the Company reported a net loss of $3,246,000 or ($1.59) per share, compared to a net income of $48,000 or $0.02 per share for the same period ended December 31, 2016.\nIncluded in the 2017 loss are non-cash expenses of $3,047,000 including an impairment expense of $2,626,000 to reduce the carrying value of the Company’s oil and gas properties, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense of $396,000 and a $25,000 expense to write off assets from the operations at a retirement center that was discontinued in 2017.\nRevenues: Total revenues from the oil & gas operation was $791,000 in 2017 and $764,000 in 2016. Net revenue for our oil and gas operation increased by $27,000 in 2017 as compared to 2016. Included in 2016 revenue is a onetime fee of $30,000. The increase in revenue in 2017 was principally due to an increase in the quantity of oil and gas produced.\nOperating Expenses: Operating expenses for continuing oil & gas operations was $1,027,000 in 2017 and $1,181,000 in 2016. This decrease of $154,000 was principally due to a reduction of depreciation and depletion expense of $174,000. The remaining increase was the result of an overall reduction in operating expenses.\nIn 2017 pursuant to the requirements of the “full cost ceiling test” for oil & gas companies we recorded a non-cash charge to operations of $2,646,000 to write down its investment in Ohio and West Virginia. This charge to earnings was caused by a revaluation of the Company’s non-producing oil and gas reserves.\nCorporate Expenses were $408,000 in 2017 and $352,000 in 2016. The increase is due to an overall increase in operating expenses.\nInterest Expense: Interest Expense was $24,000 in 2017 as compared to $38,000 in 2016. The decrease was due to a reduction in the long term debt.\nOther Income & (Expense): Other income & (expense) was $28,000 for 2017 as compared to ($110,000) in 2016. In 2017 the most significant item was the receipt of $64,000 for a receivable the Company had previously written off. The expenses in 2016 were principally the write off assets pertaining to the termination of the lease at the retirement center.\nDiscontinued Operations: The Company leased and operated Pacific Pointe Retirement Inn (“Pacific Pointe”) a retirement community in King City, Oregon. Our lease provided that should the property be sold the lease maintained by the Company would be terminated. The owners completed the sale of the building on March 30, 2017 and our lease terminated on that date. These financial statements reflect the operations of the retirement community as a discontinued operation. Net income (loss) from discontinued operations was ($5,000) and $4,000 in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nAbout New Concept Energy, Inc.\nNew Concept Energy, Inc. is a Dallas-based oil and gas company which owns oil and gas wells and mineral leases in Ohio and in West Virginia.
