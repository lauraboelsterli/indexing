    "text": "(Reuters) - Germany claimed another sporting world title as Saxonia Globe Snippers won this year’s World Marbles Championship in Tinsley Green, near London Gatwick Airport.\nThe former winners beat English defending champions Johnson Jets for their first success since 2004.\n“(We were) a little rusty, we have not really played in 12 years,” winning team member Yann Langer said.\nOther teams from Britain and the United States also took part in the event, which is contested every Easter in the car park at the Greyhound public house, the venue since 1938.\nIn the best tradition of the British bank holiday weekend, there was heavy rain throughout.\nAccording to the event’s Facebook page there was an unfortunate end to the afternoon when a number of trophies and medals disappeared, although they were eventually recovered from various customers in the bar.\nReporting by Steve Tongue, editing by Ed Osmond\n ",
