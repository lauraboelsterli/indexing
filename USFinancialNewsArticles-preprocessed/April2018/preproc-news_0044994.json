    "text": "April 22, 2018 / 10:11 AM / Updated 2 hours ago Athletics - Bounasser wins Vienna marathon as Kimetto drops out Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nVIENNA (Reuters) - Morocco’s Salaheddine Bounasser was the surprise winner of the Vienna marathon on Sunday while world record holder Dennis Kimetto’s injury frustration continued as he failed to finish. Salaheddine Bounasser of Morocco crosses the finish line to win the Vienna City Marathon in Vienna, Austria, April 22, 2018. REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader \nBounasser, who won in two hours, nine minutes and 29 seconds, and Kenya’s Ishmael Bushendich broke away from the rest of the pack as they passed the Ernest Happel stadium. \nThey raced side by side for around 20 minutes before Bounasser made his move at the 39-kilometre mark and left the Kenyan in his wake. Bushendich finished second in 2:10:03 and his fellow Kenyan Samwel Maswai was third. \nKimetto, who ran a world record of 2:02:57 in Berlin 2014, was hoping to rekindle his career in Vienna after a series of injury frustrations. Slideshow (4 Images) \nThe 34-year-old has not finished a marathon since London in 2016 and suffered another unhappy day as he also dropped out in Vienna. \nKimetto was clearly limping as he lost touch with the leading pack around halfway through the race and he dropped out after one hour and 20 minutes. \n(The story corrects adjective to “unhappy” in penultimate paragraph.)
