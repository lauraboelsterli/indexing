(BMV:GCC*), a leading producer of cement and ready-mix concrete in the United States and Mexico, today announces its results for the first quarter of 2018.\nTotal sales increased 13.6% in 1Q2018, with U.S. sales up 11.9% and Mexico sales up 18.0%. EBITDA grew 40.6%, and the EBITDA margin increased 470 basis points. Net income increased 554.6%, with earnings per share of US$ 0.034. Operating income before other expenses increased 107.1%.

The increases reflect strong cement demand and favorable cement pricing environments in both the United States and Mexico; increased ready-mix demand in Mexico; the effect of peso appreciation compared to the dollar; and strict control of operating expenses.\nEnrique Escalante, GCC’s CEO, noted, “Our U.S. operations are catching the tailwind from the strong market in 2017 and the benefit of relatively mild winter weather in some of our markets. In Mexico, sales volumes were above our expectations. GCC’s consolidated EBITDA reached 24.3%, up 470 basis points from the previous year. Our EBITDA margin in Mexico reached an all-time record of 42.7% and U.S. margins were 16.6%, the highest for a first quarter since the 2009 financial crisis.”\nCOMPLETE EARNINGS REPORT\nGCC’s complete earnings report is available on GCC’s Investor Relations page .\nCONFERENCE CALL\nGrupo Cementos de Chihuahua, S.A.B. de C.V. will host its earnings conference call on April 25, 2018.\nTime: 11:00 am (Eastern Time) / 10:00 am (Mexico City) / 09:00 am (Mountain Time) Dial in: U.S.: 1-888-289-0438 Toll Free International: 1-323-794-2423 Conference ID: 7937298 Replay (through May 2, 2018): U.S.: 1-844-512-2921 Toll Free International: 1-412-317-6671 Conference ID: 7937298 Listen-only webcast and replay: click here .\nFor further information, contact:\nGCC Investor Relations: Ricardo Martinez\n+1 (303) 739 5943\nrmartinezg@gcc.com Daniel Wilson, Zemi Communications\n+1 212 689 9560\ndbmwilson@zemi.com About GCC\nGCC is a leading supplier of cement, concrete, aggregates, and construction‐related services in the United States and Mexico, with an annual cement production capacity of 5.1 million metric tons.
