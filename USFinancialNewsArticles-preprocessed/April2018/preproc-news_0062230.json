(NASDAQ: EVBG), the global leader in critical event management and enterprise safety software applications to help keep people safe and businesses running faster, today announced that Tracy Reinhold has joined the company as Chief Security Officer. Mr. Reinhold will be responsible for advancing Everbridge’s enterprise-level security strategy, as well as working closely with customers and partners to optimize their organizational approach to managing and responding to critical events. This newly created role will report to CEO Jaime Ellertson.\nMr. Reinhold has served in executive leadership roles in security and incident management for some of the world’s largest brands. As Chief Security Officer at Fannie Mae, a leader in mortgage financing with more than $3 trillion in assets, Mr. Reinhold was responsible for designing and managing the company’s enterprise resilience strategy. He established a robust enterprise response model that enabled senior leaders to respond to security and business disruptions in an efficient and consistent manner. His leadership was instrumental to ensuring the safety and security of all employees, contractors and visitors at locations nationwide, and successfully protecting company assets including over 3 million square feet of office space.\nPrior to Fannie Mae, Mr. Reinhold served as Vice President of Global Investigations at Walmart. He had been recruited by the retail giant to investigate and protect company interests related to compliance and ethics concerns across its global portfolio. In less than three years, he created and led a team of global investigators in the United States, Asia, Africa, South America and the United Kingdom.\n“The role of Chief Security Officer continues to evolve in complexity as well as in terms of its importance to the creation of business value,” said Ellertson. “Tracy has demonstrated an impressive track record in helping Fortune 500 businesses bridge the gap between security and risk to maximize the operational response to critical events. We are excited to add Tracy’s deep insight and expertise in helping customers address today’s wide-ranging security challenges.”\nPrior to his commercial roles in security, Mr. Reinhold served as a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation for twenty-two years. During this time, he was a member of the Senior Executive Service, served as Associate Executive Assistant Director for National Security, and led the FBI’s intelligence division.\n“Everbridge is the gold standard for how enterprises deliver organizational resilience on an unprecedented scale,” said Reinhold. “I look forward to working alongside Everbridge’s talented leadership team in helping to expand the reach and impact of the company’s global Critical Event Management platform and solutions.”\nMr. Reinhold is a frequent speaker across the industry on “Improving Organizational Resilience Through Enhanced Security Practices.” He will be presenting at the upcoming 64 th annual ASIS event in Las Vegas on the topic of “The Changing Role of the CSO in Today’s Corporate Landscape.”\nAbout Everbridge\nEverbridge, Inc.
