    "text": "0 COMMENTS A ZTE smart phone is pictured in this illustration taken Tuesday. Photo: Reuters \nThe seven-year ban on U.S. exports to Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE Corp. announced this week shook up markets and rattled the company’s suppliers, but it also illustrates the pitfalls of misleading law enforcement, said observers and attorneys.\nZTE misled the U.S. Commerce Department since striking a $1.19 billion settlement last year over export-controls and sanctions violations, the department said Monday . It accused the firm of making false statements during the settlement negotiations and the period following the agreement.\nZTE retained and paid full bonuses to employees it was supposed to discipline for the violations; the government only learned about it after the Commerce Department requested documents verifying the action, the U.S. alleged.\nThe Chinese company halted trading on Tuesday following the allegations. It said in a brief statement it “is assessing the full range of potential implications” of the U.S. order and is communicating with relevant parties over how to respond. ZTE relies on U.S. components for its products.\nZTE established a crisis-management team, the company’s chairman said in a memo seen by the South China Morning Post. In it he appealed for calm from the company’s 80,000 workers. “The company is actively communicating and giving its all to resolve this crisis,” said Chairman Yin Yimin in the memo.\nThe U.S. allegations sent the stock prices of optical-component firms sliding and placed American companies in the crossfire . The broader lesson, said observers, is the company didn’t keep the promises it made when signing the settlement.\n“Law enforcement hates nothing more than being lied to,” said Douglas Jacobson, a partner at the international trade-focused firm Jacobson Burton Kelley PLLC, which represents companies that import products from, and export components to, ZTE.\nThere’s no grace period for exported U.S. products already in transit to ZTE, said Mr. Jacobson. Moreover, he said, it will take ZTE a long time to find equivalent non-U.S. components, if it ever does.\nThe Commerce Department “is sending a message,” he said. “It’ll be very difficult for them to overcome this denial order,” said Mr. Jacobson.\nCompanies that ignore U.S. law put their access to U.S. technology and markets at risk, said Daniel Glaser, principal at the Financial Integrity Network, a consultancy that advises governments and companies on illicit finance threats.\n“Firms facing enforcement actions need to be fully forthcoming with U.S. officials and follow through on their commitments to the U.S. government, both in letter and spirit,” said Mr. Glaser, who previously served in the U.S. Treasury Department.\n“It should be no surprise when the U.S. government takes decisive action against violators because the export-control regime, along with the sanctions and anti-money laundering regimes, are vital to U.S. national security,” he said.\nWrite to Samuel Rubenfeld at Samuel.Rubenfeld@wsj.com.
