FILE PHOTO: A plane by Lufthansa is seen next to a Lufthansa flag at the international airport in Munich, Germany, January 9, 2018. REUTERS/Michaela Rehle/File Photo\nLufthansa on Thursday reported a slight rise in adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to 26 million euros ($32 million), far short of the 81.3 million euros forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll.\nLufthansa is rapidly growing its Eurowings brand to fill the gap left by the collapse of Air Berlin.\nLufthansa said one-off costs from integrating parts of Air Berlin pushed Eurowings to an adjusted loss of 203 million euros in the first-quarter and said one-off expenses will continue to weigh in coming months.\nIt also lowered its guidance for total capacity growth to 8.5 percent from its previous forecast of 9.5 percent.\n($1 = 0.8214 euros)",
