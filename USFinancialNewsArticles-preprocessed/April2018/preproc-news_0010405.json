    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 04, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Wolf Wiese CEO of Golden Dawn Minerals Inc., (TSX-V:GOM) (FRANKFURT:3G8A) (OTC:GDMRF) (the “ Company” or “Golden Dawn ”) announces that the Company proposes to undertake a financing of $3,000,000 post the Consolidation (the “ Consolidation ”) of its share capital on the basis of two (2) old common shares for one (1) new common share. The Company’s outstanding warrants and options will be consolidated as well. The proposed Consolidation is subject to the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange.\nManagement has carefully considered the Consolidation and concluded that a 2:1 Consolidation is in the best interest of the Company and the Company’s shareholders and will aid with future capital raises. The Company is steadily advancing its Greenwood Precious Metals Project, to commence trial mining at the Lexington Mine by the third quarter of 2018.\nAs of the date hereof, the Company has 134,758,258 common shares issued and outstanding. After giving effect to the Consolidation, the Company would have approximately 67,379,129 common shares issued and outstanding. The Company’s outstanding share purchase warrants and incentive stock options will also be consolidated. The Company does not propose to change the corporate name of the Company in conjunction with the Consolidation.\nThe Company also announces that it intends to undertake an equity financing (the “ Offering ”) of Units (the “ Units ”) for up to $3,000,000. The price per Unit will be announced 5 days after the effective day of the Consolidation. The Company intends to use the proceeds from the Offering to advance its Greenwood Precious Metals Project.\nThe Company also announces that effective March 31, 2018 Diana Mark has resigned as Vice-President, Corporate Affairs. We have appreciated her leadership in the area of corporate governance. She will continue to provide the Company with consulting services.\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors:\nGOLDEN DAWN MINERALS INC.\nWolf Wiese, President & CEO\nFor further information, please contact:\nCorporate Communications\n604-221-8936\nallinfo@goldendawnminerals.com\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this news release.\nThe Company would like to clarify that its decision to proceed to extract mineralized material from the Golden Crown and Lexington deposits for processing at its facility located at the Greenwood Precious Metals Project is not based on a feasibility study. The Company cautions that, in such cases, there is increased uncertainty and higher economic and technical risks of failure.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements: Certain disclosure in this release constitutes forward-looking statements.
