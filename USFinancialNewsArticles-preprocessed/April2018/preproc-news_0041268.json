    "text": "April 19, 2018 / 2:16 AM / Updated 39 minutes ago Despite strikes, Syria's Assad can still wage chemical attacks - U.S. sources John Walcott , Phil Stewart 4 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. assessments following the U.S., British and French missile strikes on Syria show they had only a limited impact on President Bashar al-Assad’s ability to carry out chemical weapons attacks, four U.S. officials told Reuters. \nThe conclusion contrasts with the Trump administration’s assertion that the strikes on Saturday hit at the heart of Assad’s chemical weapons programme, language suggesting that Assad’s ability to stage more attacks had been dealt a devastating blow. \nThe United States, France and Britain destroyed three targets tied to Syria’s weapons program. The most important of them was the Barzah Research and Development Center, which U.S. intelligence concluded was involved in the production and testing of chemical and biological warfare technology. \nBut the U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the available intelligence indicated that Assad’s stock of chemicals and precursors was believed to be scattered far beyond the three targets. \nSome of it, U.S. and allied intelligence suggests, is stored in schools and civilian apartment buildings, which one of the officials referred to as “human shields.” \nU.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, in remarks to Congress a day before the strikes, acknowledged that one of his top priorities in crafting the operation would be to minimize the loss of life to civilians. \nAsked about the assertion that the strikes had only a limited impact, a White House National Security Council spokesman said the purpose of the military operation was to hold Syria’s government accountable, degrade its capability and deter it from chemical attacks in the future - “all while minimizing civilian casualties.” \nA Pentagon spokesman referred Reuters to Mattis’ warning to Assad and his forces to “not perpetrate another chemical weapons attack for which they will be held accountable.” \nSyria and Russia deny unleashing poison gas on April 7 during their offensive on Douma, which ended with the recapture of the town that had been the last rebel stronghold near the capital, Damascus. The suspected chemical attack triggered the U.S. response. Related Coverage",
