    "text": "Achieves Company Record First-Quarter Operating Ratio of 83.9%\nTHOMASVILLE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (Nasdaq: ODFL) today announced financial results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, which include the following:\nThree Months Ended March 31, % (In thousands, except per share amounts)\n2018 2017 Chg. Total revenue $ 925,020 $ 754,096 22.7 % LTL services revenue $ 911,054 $ 740,186 23.1 % Other services revenue $ 13,966 $ 13,910 0.4 % Operating income $ 149,340 $ 108,122 38.1 % Operating ratio 83.9 % 85.7 % Net income $ 109,333 $ 65,792 66.2 % Diluted earnings per share $ 1.33 $ 0.80 66.3 % Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 82,356 82,444 (0.1 )% “Old Dominion had a great start to 2018, with first-quarter results that included many new Company records. We had our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth, and our quarterly revenue exceeded $900 million for the first time in our history,” commented Greg C. Gantt, the Company’s President and Chief Operating Officer, who, as previously announced, will transition to the combined role of President and Chief Executive Officer effective May 16, 2018. “The domestic economy continues to be strong, and we believe our ability to deliver superior service in this favorable operating environment will position us to win additional market share. The strength of our revenue growth contributed to a 180 basis-point improvement in our operating ratio for the quarter, and these factors, when combined with the substantial reduction in our income tax rate due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, drove a 66.3% increase in earnings per diluted share.”\n“Revenue for the quarter increased 22.7%, due primarily to a 15.4% increase in LTL tons and a 5.9% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight. The growth in LTL tons reflects a 10.5% increase in LTL shipments and a 4.5% increase in LTL weight per shipment. Even with the increase in LTL weight per shipment and 0.7% decline in length of haul, both of which generally have the effect of reducing revenue per hundredweight, we generated a 3.7% increase in revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges. Consistent with our long-term pricing philosophy, we will continue to focus on individual account profitability to ensure that our yield improvement offsets cost inflation while also supporting our continued investment in the Company.\n“Our operating ratio improved to 83.9% for the first quarter of 2018, which is a new Company record for the first quarter. With growth in LTL volumes driving improved freight density and the improvement in our yield, we gained significant leverage with respect to many of our cost elements during the quarter. Salaries, wages and benefits improved 100 basis points to 54.2% of revenue, even as we experienced an anticipated increase in employee benefit costs. We continued to add employees during the first quarter to ensure adequate capacity for expected growth, with an increase of 11.9% in our average number of full-time employees compared with the first quarter last year. Despite the number of new employees and a double-digit increase in LTL shipments, we are proud that our dedicated team was able to provide on-time deliveries of 99% and a cargo claims ratio of 0.2%.”\nCash Flow and Use of Capital\nOld Dominion’s net cash provided by operating activities was $211.2 million for the first quarter of 2018, a 90.6% increase compared to the first quarter of 2017. The Company had $159.9 million in cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2018, and its ratio of debt-to-total capitalization was 1.9% compared with 4.0% at December 31, 2017.\nCapital expenditures were $100.6 million for the first quarter of 2018. Based on first-quarter results and the Company’s outlook for 2018, the Company has increased its expected capital expenditures for 2018 to a total of approximately $555 million from the previous estimate of $510 million. This total includes planned expenditures of $200 million for real estate and service center expansion projects; $310 million for tractors and trailers; and $45 million for technology and other assets.\nOld Dominion returned $28.0 million of capital to its shareholders in the first quarter of 2018, consisting of $10.7 million of cash dividends and $17.3 million of share repurchases.\nSummary\nMr. Gantt concluded, “Old Dominion is firmly committed to its long-term strategy of delivering superior customer service at a fair price, while continuously investing in capacity to support our growth initiatives. We believe the time-tested strengths of our strategic plan are evidenced by our current and historic financial results, market share gains and shareholder value creation. We also believe that our ability to consistently deliver this value proposition has created a unique position for us in the LTL transportation industry. As a result, we are confident that the continued execution of our long-term strategy creates a significant opportunity for us to produce further growth in market share, earnings and shareholder value.”\nOld Dominion will hold a conference call to discuss this release today at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
