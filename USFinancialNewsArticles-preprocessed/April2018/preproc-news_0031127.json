    "text": "LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Maverick Natural Resources, LLC (“Maverick”), announced today that it began operating on April 6, 2018, after it emerged from Chapter 11 as the successor to Breitburn Energy Partners LP (“Breitburn”). Maverick is majority-owned and controlled by funds and accounts managed by EIG Global Energy Partners (“EIG”).\nAs a result of the restructuring process, Maverick has debt of approximately $105 million, which is substantially lower than Breitburn’s $2.96 billion debt balance prior to initiating the restructuring process.

Maverick will emerge with low leverage, a simple balance sheet, and sufficient liquidity to remain adaptive to the ever-changing market conditions. Following a judicious review of the asset portfolio and cost structure, we believe Maverick is well-positioned to capitalize on cost reduction initiatives, to deploy capital to high growth prospects and to potentially build the platform through strategic acquisitions.”\nHalbert S. Washburn, Maverick’s Chief Executive Officer, said: “Today marks a new beginning for our company and all of our stakeholders and the end of a difficult period managing through the steep and sustained decline in oil and natural gas prices. Throughout the extended restructuring process, we remained focused on our key goals of managing production and reducing costs to preserve the value of our diverse and long-lived portfolio, substantially reducing debt and dramatically improving our liquidity position, and achieving a consensual plan of reorganization among our key creditor groups. I would like to thank our outstanding employees for their unwavering commitment throughout the restructuring process.”\nFollowing are highlights of Maverick’s current portfolio of assets:\nOperated approximately 88% of stable long-lived production in 2017, averaging 39,742 Boe/d Estimated proved reserves of 152.2 MMBOE, approximately 97% of which are proved developed reserves with a proved reserve life index averaging more than 10 years Approximately 1 million gross acres (600,000 net) Approximately 11,500 gross wells (7,600 net)\nMaverick’s Board of Directors is comprised of the following individuals:\n• Halbert S.
