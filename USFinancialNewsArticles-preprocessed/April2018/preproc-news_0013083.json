    "text": "ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Singapore’s Temasek and Britain’s Metric Capital have bought into Nusr-Et steakhouse owner D.ream in a deal valuing the Turkish firm at $1.2 billion.\nFILE PHOTO - A Temasek logo is seen at the annual Temasek Review in Singapore July 7, 2016. REUTERS/Edgar Su Nusr-Et was made famous by butcher-turned-social media star Nusret Gokce, who went viral under the nickname “Salt Bae” in 2017 after posting videos of himself salting meat.\nSalt Bae’s distinctive cobra-like manoeuver earned Gokce more than 12 million Instagram followers and has helped launch Nusr-Et restaurants in the Middle East, New York and Miami.\nDogus Restaurant Entertainment and Management (D.ream), which has a presence in 170 locations in 12 countries, said on Monday state-owned Temasek Holding and Metric Capital had paid $200 million for a 17 percent holding.\nReporting by Ebru Tuncay; Writing by Ali Kucukgocmen; Editing by David Dolan and Alexander Smith\n ",
