    "text": "Completion of the $18.1 Million Initial Public Offering Accelerates the Expected Timeline to Retail Series FUV Production\nEUGENE, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Arcimoto, Inc.® (NASDAQ: FUV), makers of the world’s first Fun Utility Vehicle® (FUV®) — an affordable and practical pure electric vehicle for everyday commuters and fleets — today announced financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and provided a business update.\nRecent Company Highlights:\nPre-orders for the FUV increased to approximately 2,234 units, as compared to approximately 1,076 units at December 31, 2016 Raised $18.1 million in net proceeds through a Regulation A+ initial public offering and listed shares for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market in September 2017 Established its first U.S. manufacturing plant in Eugene, Oregon in October of 2017 Accelerated the expected timeline to Phase 2 Retail Series FUV production through the expedited ordering of critical manufacturing and fabrication equipment Delivered the first Signature Series FUVs to paying customers Debuted the FUV at several notable auto industry events\nArcimoto Manufacturing Plant (AMP) Update Video\nThe Company has released its first corporate update video since listing on NASDAQ. This update showcases both the Company’s accomplishments since its September 21, 2017 debut on NASDAQ, and how it is moving expeditiously towards significant vehicle production. This video can be accessed on the Company’s website.\nManagement Commentary\n“We’ve made significant progress here at Arcimoto, thanks to the substantial support we received in our initial public offering in September of 2017,” said Mark Frohnmayer, Founder and President of Arcimoto. “Using this capital injection, we hit the ground running in the fourth quarter of 2017. We began facility improvements on our factory in early October, and had the full team moved in by the end of the year. We also ordered and began installing some key pieces of automated equipment and started delivering the first Signature Series Fun Utility Vehicles to paying customers.\n“We’ve also continued to grow our base of pre-orders for our pioneering FUV electric vehicle. As we begin to deliver more FUVs to our pre-order customers, we expect the pace of new orders to accelerate as a result of owner referrals, strategic partnerships and other innovative marketing initiatives, which we believe have the potential to create significant value for our shareholders.\n“Arcimoto’s position in the market represents the culmination of a decade-long journey to create a true sustainable mobility solution. We are working on transitioning from a development-stage venture to a next-generation vehicle production enterprise. We are committed to creating a world-class production facility, capable of manufacturing reliable, high-quality, and affordable electric vehicles for the masses, and we are pleased to report that we are on-plan in meeting that commitment.”\nUpcoming Events\nArcimoto is scheduled to present at The MicroCap Conference in New York City on April 9, 2018, and management will host one-on-one meetings throughout the day. The conference is being held on April 9-10, 2018 at the JW Marriott Essex House. Registration is mandatory for conference participation.

Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements that express our intentions, beliefs, expectations, strategies, predictions or any other statements relating to our future activities or other future events or conditions. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our business based, in part, on assumptions made by management. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may, and are likely to, differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements due to numerous factors discussed from time to time in documents which we file with the SEC.
