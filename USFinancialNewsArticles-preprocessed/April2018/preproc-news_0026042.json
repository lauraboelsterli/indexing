    "text": "TOKYO, April 13 (Reuters) - Japanese government bond prices dipped across the board on Friday as improved investor risk appetite in the broader markets lifted equities and curbed demand for safe-haven debt.\nThe five-year JGB yield was half a basis point higher at minus 0.115 percent. The benchmark 10-year yield also rose half a basis point, to 0.035 percent.\nThe 40-year yield was half a basis point higher at 0.835 percent.\nLosses in JGBs were limited as the Bank of Japan conducted a regular debt-purchasing operation, buying 840 billion yen ($7.82 billion) of one- to 40-year bonds on Friday.\nPressuring JGBs, the Nikkei share average gained 0.6 percent as suggestions from U.S. President Donald Trump that a military strike on Syria may not be imminent supported investor sentiment.
