    "text": "NEWPORT BEACH, Calif., April 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DynTek, Inc. (DYNE.OTC), a leading provider of professional technology services , today announced results for its third quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancial & Business Highlights\nThird Quarter 2018 Ended March 31, 2018\nRevenues decreased 16.4% to $34.7 million Gross profit decreased 11.8% to $6.6 million Total operating expenses decreased 2.3% to $5.4 million Net earnings decreased 87.8% to $.115 million EBITDA decreased 33.9% to $1.4 million Diluted earnings per share decreased to $0.05\nNine Months Ended March 31, 2018\nRevenues increased 12.4% to $120.6 million Gross profit increased 17.5% to $21.8 million Total operating expenses increased 14.6% to $17.9 million plus a $1.4 million charge for the Company’s stock option buyback which brought total expenses to $19.3 million EBITDA increased 39.7% to $4.4 million Net earnings decreased 40.9% to $.664 million Diluted earnings per share decreased to $0.28\nManagement Comment\nIn our third quarter, we continued our solid performance in revenue and gross profit but had several product orders delayed due to manufacturer shortages. The reduced operating expenses reflect the lower sales in this quarter.\nIn our nine months year to date, we achieved significant year-on-year growth in revenue and gross profit, due in part to delivering higher volume, higher margin solutions. Our year to date EBITDA growth of 39.7% reflects control over operating expenses as revenues continue to rise.\nOur net earnings for the quarter and year to date were impacted by a $.650 million non-cash tax provision for the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets at the lower tax rates from the 2018 Tax Act. The final provision will be recorded next quarter in preparation for our fiscal year end.\n“The need to modernize and secure data centers and IT infrastructure in support of the new digital economy is a driving factor in our double-digit year to date growth,” said Ron Ben-Yishay, DynTek’s chief executive officer. “Cybersecurity solutions – both products and service engagements – are a de facto component of every strategy session with clients. In addition, cloud adoption continues to increase as our clients embrace hybrid cloud architecture to support critical business initiatives and improve their customer and employee experiences.”\nEBITDA\nThe Company defines EBITDA as net income from operations before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation. Other companies may calculate EBITDA differently. Although EBITDA is a widely used financial indicator of a company's ability to service debt, it is not a recognized measure for financial statement presentation under generally accepted accounting procedures (GAAP). EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as superior or as an alternative to net income or to cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP. Nonetheless, the Company believes that EBITDA provides useful supplemental information for investors and others to measure operating performance, especially in situations where a company has significant non-cash operating expenses that are not indicative of core business operating results. EBITDA is widely used in the IT services industry to analyze comparable company performance, and management of the Company also uses EBITDA, in addition to GAAP information, as a measure of operating performance for assessing its business units.\nAbout DynTek\nDynTek is a leading provider of professional technology services to mid-market companies, such as state and local governments, educational institutions and commercial entities in the largest IT markets nationwide.
