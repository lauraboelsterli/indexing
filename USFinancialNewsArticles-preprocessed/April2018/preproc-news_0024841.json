REUTERS/Francois Lenoir/File Photo “We are still in doubt,” Malmstrom said during a visit in Copenhagen.\nU.S. President Donald Trump has given the EU and six countries until May 1 to negotiate permanent exemptions from tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum.\nMalmstrom said she had not received any new deadline but holds “regular discussions” with U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on the issue.\nReporting by Stine Jacobsen; Editing by Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen and Alison Williams\n ",
