    "text": "EditorsNote: fixes “one-out hit” in fifth graf; removes “rookie” in next-to-last graf\nJulio Teheran struck out nine batters in six strong innings, and the Atlanta Braves ended the visiting Philadelphia Phillies’ six-game winning streak with a 2-1 win on Monday at SunTrust Park.\nTeheran (1-1) allowed one run on five hits, one of them a solo homer from Odubel Herrera in the first inning. The right-hander walked three. He threw 96 pitches, 61 of them for strikes.\nAtlanta (9-6) tied the game in the bottom of the first inning when Freddie Freeman grounded into a double play that scored Ender Inciarte. The Braves got their other run in the fourth when Ozzie Albies scored on Kurt Suzuki’s sacrifice fly.\nThe Atlanta bullpen, which allowed nine runs in the eighth inning on Saturday against the Chicago Cubs, had better luck against the Phillies. Three relievers combined for three scoreless innings, allowing just one hit. Shane Carle recorded two outs in the seventh, and A.J. Minter worked 1 1/3 innings, working around a pair of walks in the eighth.\nCloser Arodys Vizcaino finished the game with a scoreless ninth. Vizcaino worked around a one-out hit, struck out one and earned his first save.\nAaron Nola (1-1) absorbed just his second career loss against Atlanta. The right-hander allowed two runs in six innings on four hits and one walk. Nola struck out two. He is now 5-2 in nine career appearances against the Braves.\nPhiladelphia (9-6) got two hits each from Herrera, who is now batting .340, and J.P. Crawford. The Phillies had only six hits and left 10 runners on base. They were 0-for-7 with runners in scoring position.\nAtlanta mustered just four hits, two of them from Albies. The second baseman was 2-for-3, extending his hitting streak to five games and raising his batting average to .328.\nTeheran improved to 9-6 in his career against Philadelphia. He received a no-decision against the Phillies in the season opener, when he received zero runs from his offense until a late comeback against the Phillies’ bullpen.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
