    "text": "Mike Foltynewicz pitched six strong innings and Nick Markakis hit his fourth home run to lead the Atlanta Braves to a 4-1 win over the Philadelphia Phillies on Saturday at Citizens Bank Park.\nFoltynewicz (2-1) allowed one run on three hits and two walks, striking out six. The right-hander allowed one run for the third time this season and has yet to give up more than three in six starts. He improved to 4-2 against Philadelphia and picked up his first decision against the Phillies this season.\nArodys Vizcaino worked around a walk and struck out the side to pitch a scoreless ninth inning and earn his third save.\nThe two teams have split the first two games of the series. The rubber game will be Sunday.\nThe losing pitcher was Nick Pivetta (1-1), who allowed four runs on six hits and three walks in five innings. He struck out six. It was the worst start of the season for Pivetta, who allowed a season-high in runs. It was his first decision in three starts against Atlanta, and his career record against the Braves dropped to 5-3.\nMarkakis got Atlanta on the board in the second inning with a solo homer to right field, his fourth. Markakis went 1-for-2 with three walks and extended his hitting streak to six games.\nThe Braves added two runs in the third to take a 3-0 lead. Ender Inciarte drove in Ryan Flaherty with a single to right, and Ozzie Albies added a sacrifice fly to right.\nAtlanta went ahead 4-0 with a run in the fifth inning. Freddie Freeman tripled into the right-field corner to score Albies.\nPhiladelphia got its lone run in the fifth on a solo home run from Maikel Franco, his third.\nThe Phillies threatened in the eighth inning when Atlanta reliever A.J. Minter walked Cesar Hernandez and Carlos Santana to start the inning. After retiring Odubel Herrera on a liner to left, Minter was relieved by Dan Winkler. He struck out Rhys Hoskins and Nick Williams to end the inning.\nPhiladelphia lost shortstop J.P. Crawford in the eighth inning. He had to leave the game with an injured elbow.\nâ€”Field Level Media\n ",
