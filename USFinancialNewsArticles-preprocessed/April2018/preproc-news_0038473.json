    "text": "April 17, 2018 / 5:08 AM / Updated 28 minutes ago Trump, Japan's Abe seek consensus on North Korea amid strains Steve Holland 4 Min Read \nWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will seek common ground on how to deal with North Korea’s nuclear challenge on Tuesday amid fears in Tokyo that Trump might be prone to make too many concessions. \nAbe is due to arrive at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago retreat in Palm Beach, Florida, for two days of talks dominated by North Korea but also expected to cover trade, relations with China and other issues. \nBoth leaders could use a successful summit to give themselves a political boost at home. Trump has been hounded by controversies linked to an investigation into Russian meddling into the 2016 election, and Abe is struggling with declining popularity because of scandals over suspected cronyism. \nTrump has forged close ties with Abe during his 15 months in power and the two have bonded over rounds of golf during Abe’s last visit to Florida more than a year ago and Trump’s visit to Tokyo last November. \nTokyo fears the U.S. leader will try to link vital security matters with touchy trade topics. \n“I want to reaffirm our cooperation on North Korea, our cooperation on economic matters, and show the strong ties between our two countries,” Abe said before leaving Tokyo. \nTrump said on Twitter on Tuesday he looked forward to the meeting with Abe: “Working on Trade and Military Security.” \nTrump’s agreement to hold a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, a session expected in late May or early June at a place yet to be determined, has also raised some concerns among Japanese officials. \nJapan wants Trump to avoid a deal in which Pyongyang gives up ballistic missiles that can hit the U.S. mainland but keeps shorter-range missiles that threaten Japan. Abe also wants Trump to bring up Japanese citizens kidnapped by Pyongyang long ago. \nAbe told Japan’s parliament last week he would ask Trump to seek elimination of all North Korean missiles that could reach Japan. Only getting rid of intercontinental ballistic missiles “has no meaning for Japan,” Kyodo news agency quoted him as saying. Related Coverage Trump says it's possible summit with North Korea's Kim won't happen \nIn response, the White House made clear Trump is concerned about the security of U.S. allies in addition to the American people. \n“Not allowing North Korea to threaten the U.S. just means that we remain committed to achieving the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” a White House official said. TRADE AGENDA \nTokyo is equally eager to avoid being pushed into talks on a two-way free trade agreement aimed not only at market access but at currency policies, something South Korea recently accepted when it renegotiated a trade deal with the United States. \nAnother irritant on trade is that Japan has not been given an exemption to tariffs on steel and aluminium exports to the United States, unlike the European Union, Canada and Mexico. \nWhile Trump has said he prefers bilateral trade deals over multilateral ones, because America can win a better deal with just one country, he recently instructed United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow to reopen talks for the United States to enter the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). \nTrump killed the Pacific trade pact when he took office last year, but said recently he was open to rejoining on better terms. The 11 other countries in the TPP talks pressed ahead after Washington dropped out. \nKudlow appeared to indicate there was little prospect of immediate progress on rejoining the pact. The United States was involved in eight years of formal negotiations on the TPP before it withdrew. U.S. President Donald Trump and Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe hold a joint news conference after their meetings at Akasaka Palace in Tokyo, Japan November 6, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst \n“It is more of a thought than a policy,” Kudlow told a press briefing.
