    "text": "MEXICO CITY, April 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- FIBRA Prologis (BMV:FIBRAPL 14), a leading owner and operator of Class-A industrial real estate in Mexico, today reported results for the first quarter 2018.\nHIGHLIGHTS FROM THE QUARTER:\nNet effective rents on rollover increased 13.8 percent Same store cash NOI grew 6.6 percent Completed US$225 million term loan Repaid US$72 million secured mortgage debt\nNet earnings per CBFI in the first quarter was Ps. 0.9637 (US$0.0501) compared with Ps. (0.1377) (US$0.0081) for the same period in 2017.\nFunds from operations (FFO) per CBFI was Ps. 0.8829 (US$0.0458) for the first quarter compared with Ps. 0.8561 (US$0.0408) for the same period in 2017.\nSTRONG START TO THE YEAR\n\"Industrial real estate in Mexico is a growth industry, underpinned by demographics and a structural undersupply of modern product,\" said Luis Gutierrez, CEO, Prologis Property Mexico. \"FIBRA Prologis is positioned well to benefit from these structural drivers as evidenced by the healthy rent increases which translated to strong cash same store net operating income. Our financial results in the first quarter set the tone for what we expect to be another terrific year.\"\nOperating Portfolio\n1Q18\n1Q17\nNotes\nPeriod End Occupancy\n96.0%\n97.4%\nKnown move-outs and seasonal expirations led to expected occupancy decline\nLeases Signed\n1.6 MSF\n2.4 MSF\nCustomer Retention\n73.7%\n72.2%\nNet Effective Rent Change\n13.8%\n8.0%\nLed by Mexico City, Juarez and Tijuana\nCash Same Store NOI\n6.6%\n(1.3)%\nHigher rents and lower bad debt expense drove Cash SSNOI\nSame Store NOI\n7.1%\n(3.0)%\nSOLID FINANCIAL POSITION\nAt March 31, 2018 FIBRA Prologis' leverage was 33.2% and liquidity was Ps. 5.9 billion (US$320.7 million), which included Ps. 5.8 billion (US$312.0 million) of available capacity on its unsecured credit facility and Ps. 159.2 million (US$8.7 million) of unrestricted cash.\nDuring the quarter, FIBRA Prologis completed an unsecured term loan with a syndicate of domestic and international banks for US$225.0 million. The loan may be extended to 2023 and has a floating debt cost. Proceeds were used to repay US$72.1 million secured debt scheduled to mature in 2018 and the borrowings under the revolving credit facility. A floating to fixed interest rate swap was executed on the new US$225.0 unsecured term loan at a rate of 5.0%.\nAlso, during the quarter, FIBRA Prologis entered into an option agreement to exchange Ps. 100.0 million (US$5.0 million) per quarter at a strike price of 20 Mexican pesos per US dollar.\n\"With the recent signing of the new unsecured term loan we have addressed our 2018 maturities and replenished our liquidity,\" said Jorge Girault, senior vice president, Finance, Prologis Mexico. \"Additionally, the option contract allows to hedge our FFO and our distribution, effectively removing any downside movement related to FX.\"\nGUIDANCE UPDATE\n\"As related to building dispositions, we saw strong buyer demand, with preliminary pricing above initial expectations. That said, we have elected not to move forward due to the taxable gain that would be generated by this sale, which would have created a scenario where we could not recycle the full proceeds into new building acquisitions,\" added Girault. \"As such, we have elected to put our dispositions on hold until a solution is found.\"\n(Based in millions of U.S. dollars)\nPrevious\nRevised\nNotes\nBuilding Dispositions\n$0.0-200.0\n$0.0\nWEBCAST & CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\nFIBRA Prologis will host a live webcast/conference call to discuss quarterly results, current market conditions and future outlook.
