    "text": "DETROIT (AP) â€” While one federal agency is openly feuding with Tesla over a crash investigation, another one probing the same crash says the company is cooperating.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says on Friday that it has no concerns with the electric car maker.\nBut on Thursday the National Transportation Safety Board said it kicked Telsa out of a group investigating the crash because the company violated an agreement not to release information.\nBoth agencies are investigating a March 23 crash of a Tesla Model X SUV on a California highway that killed the driver.\nThey're looking into the performance of Tesla's semi-autonomous Autopilot driving system.\nThe safety board determines the cause of crashes and makes recommendations to prevent them. The traffic safety administration can fine automakers and impose regulations.",
