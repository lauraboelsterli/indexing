    "text": "CNBC.com Joshua Roberts | Reuters Scott Pruitt, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), speaks to employees of the agency in Washington, February 21, 2017. \nWhite House Chief of Staff John Kelly urged President Donald Trump last week to remove Environmental Protection Agency Chief Scott Pruitt , the Wall Street Journal reported Friday. \nThe newspaper, citing a White House official, said Kelly is convinced that Pruitt, who has recently been the subject of reports scrutinizing his spending habits, must step down. \nTrump, however, is happy with the job Pruitt has done as the head of the EPA and does not want him to resign, the Journal reported. \nIn a tweet Friday morning, Trump said that Pruitt is \"doing a great job but is TOTALLY under siege.\" Trump tweet Do you believe that the Fake News Media is pushing hard on a story that I am going to replace A.G. Jeff Sessions with EPA Chief Scott Pruitt, who is doing a great job but is TOTALLY under siege? Do people really believe this stuff? So much of the media is dishonest and corrupt! \nHe reiterated his confidence in Pruitt in remarks to reporters on Thursday. \nThe Journal's report comes amid a series of controversies surrounding Pruitt's conduct as a public official. Among them are questions about a apartment Pruitt rented in Washington from the wife of an energy lobbyist last year, for which he paid $50 a night. \nAn EPA watchdog initially cleared Pruitt of any wrongdoing, but later said it was missing certain facts in its initial determination . \nThe New York Times also reported on Thursday that multiple EPA officials were demoted or reassigned after questioning Pruitt's spending conduct.",
