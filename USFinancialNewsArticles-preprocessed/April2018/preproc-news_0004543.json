    "text": "MUMBAI, April 3 (Reuters) - India’s central bank late on Monday dropped Axis Bank from a list of banks it has cleared to import gold and silver in the current financial year that began April 1.\nIt was unclear why Axis, one of India’s leading importers of bullion, did not feature in the list that was released late on Monday.\nAxis Bank and the Reserve Bank of India were not immediately reachable for comment.\nBank of Baroda, HDFC Bank and Bank of Nova Scotia were among the 16 banks allowed to import bullion.\nTwo other small banks Karur Vyasa and South Indian Bank, were also dropped from the RBI list.
