    "text": "PHOENIX, April 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Richard T. Schumacher, President and CEO of Pressure BioSciences, Inc. (OTCQB:PBIO) (\"PBI\" and the \"Company\"), a leader in the development and sale of innovative, broadly enabling, high pressure-based instruments and related consumables for the worldwide life sciences industry, joined Mr. Everett Jolly on Uptick Newswire’s “Stock Day” podcast.\n“Pressure BioSciences recently released their 2017 fourth quarter and full year financial results, reporting a fourth consecutive year of increasing total revenue,” said Mr. Jolly. “You had a number of accomplishments in 2017, including the acquisition of all of BaroFold, Inc.’s assets – whose 8 patents appear to fill out your patent portfolio exceptionally. Plus, you announced the completion of a new, next-generation instrument, the development of a field sales team of four, and the announcement of important new corporate collaborations. On top of all that, Pressure BioSciences was a finalist for the R&D 100 Award, a highly prestigious global honor. What can we expect from the Company in 2018?”\n“The results we achieved in 2017 were especially rewarding in that they were achieved with only one dedicated sales person,” said Mr. Schumacher. “The enhancements we are implementing in our products, our sales and marketing capabilities, and our corporate infrastructure will allow us to better design, create, sell, support, and distribute our product line in 2018. We expect 2018 to be another solid year, highlighted by our recent acquisition of the BaroFold intellectual property, the new patents in our Ultra Shear Technology platform, and the release of our GMP-compliant software for our award-winning instrument. We believe these new assets will help expand our customer base, take us further down the path to profitability, and help increase shareholder value.”\nTo listen to the full interview please click here to the following link: https://upticknewswire.com/featured-interview-ceo-ric-schumacher-of-pressure-biosciences-inc-otcqb-pbio-4/\nFor more information on discussed topics, please click the following link:\n2017 Full Year Financial Results\nAbout Pressure BioSciences, Inc.\nPressure BioSciences, Inc. (OTCQB:PBIO) is a leader in the development and sale of innovative, broadly enabling, pressure-based solutions for the worldwide life sciences industry. Our products are based on the unique properties of both constant (i.e., static) and alternating (i.e., pressure cycling technology, or “PCT”) hydrostatic pressure. PCT is a patented enabling technology platform that uses alternating cycles of hydrostatic pressure between ambient and ultra-high levels to safely and reproducibly control bio-molecular interactions (e.g., cell lysis, biomolecule extraction). Our primary focus is in the development of PCT-based products for biomarker and target discovery, drug design and development, biotherapeutics characterization and quality control, soil & plant biology, forensics, and counter-bioterror applications. Additionally, major new market opportunities have emerged in the use of our pressure-based technologies in the following areas: (1) the use of our recently acquired PreEMT technology from BaroFold, Inc. to allow immediate entry into the biologics contract research services sector, and (2) the use of our recently-patented, scalable, high-efficiency, pressure-based Ultra Shear Technology (“UST”) platform to (i) create stable nanoemulsions of otherwise immiscible fluids (e.g., oils and water) and to (ii) prepare higher quality, homogenized, extended shelf-life or room temperature stable low-acid liquid foods that cannot be effectively preserved using existing non-thermal technologies.\nForward Looking Statements\nStatements contained in this press release regarding PBI's intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations, or predictions of the future are \"forward-looking'' statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
