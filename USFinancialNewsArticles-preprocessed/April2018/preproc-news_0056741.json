    "text": "Reaffirms Full Year 2018 Outlook\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights - as compared to the prior year first quarter (unless otherwise noted)\nNet new order value increased 13% to $242.0 million on a 10% increase in units Backlog increased 18% to 1,064 units with a value of $350.9 million Average selling price for homes delivered increased 3% to $331,000 per home Homes delivered decreased by 5% to 438 units Homebuilding revenue decreased 2% to $145.1 million Loss per share of $0.10, compares to earnings per share of $0.11 Communities with deliveries increased to 64 from 57 and selling communities increased to 73 from 55\nSCOTTSDALE, Ariz., April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AV Homes, Inc. (Nasdaq:AVHI), a developer and builder of residential communities in Florida, the Carolinas, Arizona and Texas, today announced results for its Total revenue for 2018 decreased 2% to $152.0 million from $155.5 million in 2017. The net loss of $2.3 million, or $0.10 per share in 2018 compares to net income of $2.4 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.11 for the first quarter 2017.\nRoger A. Cregg, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We are pleased with our first quarter operating performance as average selling prices increased 3%, net new orders increased 10% and backlog increased 18%. Our gross margins for the quarter, adjusted for the Dallas acquisition purchase accounting, have improved sequentially over the past several quarters and we remain in a strong liquidity position.”\nMr. Cregg continued, “We are excited about the opportunities in our business for 2018, as evidenced by the reaffirmation of our guidance for the year. Overall, our outlook continues to remain positive, supported by a favorable macroeconomic and housing environment.”\nThe decrease in total revenue was driven by lower unit volume, partially offset by higher average selling prices due to price increases. During 2018, the Company delivered 438 homes, compared to 462 homes delivered during 2017, and the average unit price per closing improved 3% to approximately $331,000 from approximately $322,000 in 2017.\nHomebuilding gross margin was 16.7% in 2018, including a 20 basis point negative impact from the purchase accounting for Oakdale-Hampton Homes, compared to 17.4% in 2017 with margin improvements in Florida and Arizona being more than offset by lower margins in the Carolinas.\nTotal SG&A expense as a percent of homebuilding revenue was 17.6% in 2018 compared to 15.0% in 2017. Homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of homebuilding revenue was 14.3% in 2018, compared to 11.9% in 2017. Corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenue was 3.3% in 2018 compared to 3.1% in the same period a year ago.\nInterest expense increased to $3.4 million in 2018 compared to $837,000 in 2017 due to the $200 million of incremental debt issued in June 2017 in connection with the refinancing which increased the company’s liquidity, reduced its interest cost and extended its debt maturities. The company had cash and cash equivalents of $175 million at March 31, 2018 and was undrawn on its $155 million senior secured credit facility.\nThe number of new housing contracts signed, net of cancellations, during the three months increased 10.1% to 731, compared to 664 units during the same period in 2017. The increase in housing contracts was primarily attributable to the increase in selling communities to 73 from 55 and better absorption rates in Florida and Arizona. The average sales price on contracts signed in 2018 increased 2.5% to approximately $331,000 from approximately $323,000 in 2017. The aggregate dollar value of the contracts signed during the first quarter increased 12.7% to $242.0 million, compared to $214.8 million during the same period one year ago. The backlog value of homes under contract but not yet closed as of March 31, 2018 increased to $350.9 million on 1,064 units, compared to $305.1 million on 905 units as of March 31, 2017.\nOriginal Full Year 2018 Outlook Reaffirmed\nCommunities with closings are expected to be approximately 75; Closings are expected to increase 20% to approximately 3,000 units; Average Selling Price (ASP) on homes closed is expected to increase 3% to approximately $340,000; Homebuilding gross margin is expected to increase 100 bps to approximately 18%, inclusive of approximately 2.8% of previously capitalized interest cost and excluding any effect of purchase accounting; SG&A is expected to improve 10 bps to approximately 12.8% of homebuilding revenue; Interest expense is expected to be approximately $8 million; Income from mortgage company joint venture is expected to be approximately $1 million; Pre-tax income of approximately $48 million; Effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 25%, with minimal cash taxes paid due to the NOL position; Net income is expected to improve to approximately $36 million; Adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase 30% to approximately $90 million.\nThe Company will hold a conference call and webcast on Friday, April 27, 2018 to discuss its first quarter financial results.
