    "text": "April 14, 2018 / 4:05 AM / in an hour After chemical weapons attack, Trump quickly changed tune on Syria Steve Holland 4 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - About 10 days ago, U.S. President Donald Trump told national security aides that he wanted U.S. forces out of Syria in six months or so, adamant that it was time to bring them home after largely defeating Islamic State militants. U.S. President Donald Trump makes a statement about Syria at the White House in Washington, U.S., April 13, 2018. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas \n“Very soon, very soon, we’re coming out,” Trump said in telegraphing his thoughts to a crowd in Richfield, Ohio, on March 30. “We’re going to get back to our country, where we belong, where we want to be.” \nNow, Trump has abruptly deepened U.S. involvement in Syria, mustering a coalition of U.S., French and British forces to attack Syrian facilities related to production of chemical weapons after a poison gas attack last week killed dozens of people in Douma, Syria. \nAides said Trump’s attitude changed when he was shown images of Syrians killed by the chemical weapons last Saturday, about a year after he first ordered air strikes against Syrian targets to retaliate for an earlier use of the banned substances. \n“When he sees these sorts of things, they outrage him,” said a source familiar with the internal debate at the White House. \nTrump had also grown exasperated with Russia for doing nothing to stop the Syrian government from using the weapons.

SYRIA TV via Reuters TV \nBehind closed doors, Trump pushed for a more aggressive response than the one taken last year, wanting options that would involve attacks on targets in Syria associated with Russia and Iran, officials said. \nHis generals pushed back, not wanting to escalate tensions with those two countries, the officials said. \nHours after the first missiles fell on Friday night, it was not yet clear how extensive the attacks were. \nMattis described them as a “one-time shot” to send a strong message to Assad not to use chemical weapons again. \nThat appeared to contradict Trump’s own pledge that the United States, France and Britain would sustain the military campaign until Assad stops using prohibited chemical agents. \nWhile Trump was determined to respond to the chemical attack, he also said the United States “does not seek an indefinite presence in Syria, under no circumstances.” \nAs Trump announced the military action, Pence was in Peru attending the Summit of the Americas. Trump had been scheduled to attend but stayed in Washington to focus on Syria. \nPence abruptly left the summit’s opening ceremonies and returned to his hotel in time to make secure phone calls to congressional leaders to tell them about the strikes. \nPence was in constant contact with Washington on his trip, speaking multiple times to Trump and also to Bolton. He again spoke to Trump after the attacks were launched, an aide said. Reporting By Steve Holland in Washington and Roberta Rampton with Pence in Lima, Peru; Editing by Kieran Murray, Toni Reinhold",
