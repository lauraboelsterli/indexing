    "text": "April 30, 2018 / 6:30 AM / Updated an hour ago Northern Irish DUP says EU's Barnier is not an honest broker-BBC Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nLONDON, April 30 (Reuters) - The leader of the Northern Irish political party that props up British Prime Minister Theresa May said the European Union’s chief negotiator was not an honest broker, the BBC reported on Monday.\n“Michel Barnier’s trying to present himself as someone who cares deeply about Northern Ireland and if that is the case he needs to hear the fact that we are part of the United Kingdom will remain part of the United Kingdom constitutionally, politically and economically,” Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster told BBC TV.\n“Therefore his proposal of us being in an all-Ireland regulatory scenario with a border down the Irish Sea simply does not work,” she said. “I don’t think he does understand the wider unionist culture of Northern Ireland.” (Reporting by Guy Faulconbridge; editing by Michael Holden)",
