    "text": "By Beth Kowitt 8:00 AM EDT \nThe staff of Fortune recently assembled our 2018 list of the World’s 50 Greatest Leaders . This story is part of that coverage. \nActivist Tarana Burke began using the phrase “Me Too” in 2006 to describe the pervasiveness of sexual abuse. Today, there’s no single face or leader of the #MeToo movement—in large part because more people than ever know that harassment in the workplace is universal. The women who have come forward to tell their stories have ousted powerful executives such as Harvey Weinstein, Steve Wynn, and Michael Ferro (see Fortune ‘s feature on Ferro’s departure from Tronc ). The ensuing reckoning is forcing leaders in every industry, not just ­media and entertainment, to change their way of thinking. \nThis article is part of the World’s 50 Greatest Leaders feature, our annual list of world-changing leaders in business, government, philanthropy and beyond.
