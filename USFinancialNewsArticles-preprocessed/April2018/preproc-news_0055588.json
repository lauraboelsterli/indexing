It did not provide an explanation for the outlook, although it said the global economy was expected to continue a gradual recovery.\nJAL posted a 2.5 percent rise in full year operating profit to 174.6 billion yen, in line with analyst estimates.\nThe results were helped by strong demand from travellers, but JAL said revenue per passenger in the domestic market fell due to competition from other airlines.\nJAL forecast operating profit to fall 4.3 percent to 167 billion yen in the financial year ending March 31, 2019 due to rising costs including fuel, depreciation and maintenance.\n“We will strive to improve cost management from a medium- to long-term perspective,” JAL said in a statement.\nBoth airlines have hedged portions of their exposure to the oil price.
