FILE PHOTO: A Swiss flag is pictured next to the Jet d'Eau (water fountain), and the Lake Leman from the St-Pierre Cathedrale in Geneva, Switzerland, June 5, 2012. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo\nThe Money Laundering Reporting Office Switzerland (MROS) handled nearly 4,700 cases of suspicious activity worth more than 16.4 billion francs in all, once again led by suspected bribery, it said in its annual report.\nCases involving suspected financing of terrorism almost doubled to 51, it said without naming any suspects.\nBanks accounted for 91 percent of the reports, which also came from asset managers, commodity traders, lawyers, insurers, credit card companies, casinos and others.\nSwitzerland led the list of countries where suspect clients were domiciled, followed by central/South America and the Caribbean. By nationality, Switzerland led again, followed by Italy and the Commonwealth of Independent States/Ukraine, the report showed.\n($1 = 0.9886 Swiss francs)",
