    "text": "Have houses in the U.S. gotten too expensive? It depends. Financial website How Much used data from real-estate site Zillow to collect home prices for every state to find the minimum income needed to afford a place there and found that, i n some areas, the income necessary is well below the national average . \nUsing a mortgage calculator, How Much calculated monthly payments, including the principal and the interest for an assumed home loan: \"The interest rate varied from 4-to-5 percent in each state, depending on the market. The lower the rate, the lower the monthly payment.
