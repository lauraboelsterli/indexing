    "text": " 03 a.m. ET Share \nPipeline capacity, labor, sand and water are among the issues \nBy Bradley Olson Getty Images The Patterson 298 natural gas fueled drilling rig drills on land in the Permian Basin that is owned by Apache Corporation. \nThe oil field at the heart of the U.S. shale boom appears to be choking on its own growth, a surprising development with big ramifications for energy profits and global markets. \nThe Permian basin of West Texas and New Mexico has been one of the few growth engines for oil CLM8, +0.76% production world-wide. The region’s output is on track to rival that of Iran or Iraq and has lifted American production to all-time highs. \nOutput is projected to climb from three million barrels a day to more than four million barrels a day within two years. The International Energy Agency forecasts that last year’s production level will double by 2023. \nBut Permian producers are starting to encounter congested pipelines and shortages of materials and workers—bottlenecks that have caused some investors to sour on the region. Some energy executives question whether sky-high forecasts are achievable.",
