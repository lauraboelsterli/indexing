Limited (“Brick” or the “Company”) (TSX:BRB), Ontario’s largest Canadian-owned brewery, today released results for the fourth quarter and full year ended January 31, 2018. Brick recorded annual EBITDA (ex one-time costs) of $9.0 million on a Net Revenue of $49.8 million. EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $1.81 million.\nGeorge Croft, Brick President and Chief Executive Officer commented, “We are pleased with the growth of our owner brands and co-pack business. The integration of our operating facilities is now complete, and we look forward to the challenge of delivering exceptional results in the upcoming year. We experienced challenging market conditions during 2017 with a cool, wet summer which drove overall full-year industry volume lower by 5.1%. Despite the category declines, Laker grew 6% in the year, Waterloo was up 10% and the LandShark and Margaritaville family grew 45%. We are excited about a new can line upgrade project that is well under way and will double our canning capacity. We expect to leverage the increased capacity and improved supply chain efficiencies over the next fiscal year in both our own branded volumes and with our contract manufacturing.\nBrick reported 28% growth or $2.3 million in contract manufacturing revenue for the year, the result of growth with both current and new customers.\nCroft added, “We have recently announced a number of new products and packaging, including Chudleigh’s Cider, Waterloo Radler Sampler and Landshark draft that we are confident will resonate with our consumers. We are also excited about the upcoming craft offerings which we believe will be a key element in realizing our growth targets in the year ahead. All of these contribute to our confidence in our ability to deliver value and growth to our shareholders for the long term.”\nThe following financial information should be read in conjunction with the audited annual financial statements of the Company prepared under IFRS for the year ended January 31, 2018.\nReconciliation of Net Earnings to Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization, and Share Based Payments (EBITDA)*\nFiscal year ended\n(in thousands of dollars)\nJanuary 31, 2018 January 31, 2017 Net income $ 2,602 $ 3,997 Add (deduct): Income tax expense 1,044 1,345 Depreciation and amortization 3,528 2,876 Loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangibles 131 - Share-based payments 316 147 Finance costs 546 478 Subtotal 5,565 4,846 EBITDA* 8,167 8,843\nSTATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nYears ended January 31, 2018 and 2017\nJanuary 31, 2018 January 31, 2017 Revenue $ 49,790,034 $ 45,176,380 Cost of sales 35,509,607 29,464,917 Gross profit 14,280,427 15,711,463 Selling, marketing and administration expenses 9,142,571 9,248,039 Other expenses 814,256 643,273 Finance costs 545,990 478,181 Loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangibles 131,068 - Income before tax 3,646,542 5,341,970 Income tax expense 1,044,075 1,345,158 Net income and comprehensive income for the year $ 2,602,467 $ 3,996,812 Basic earnings per share $ 0.07 $ 0.11 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.07 $ 0.11\nSTATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nAs at January 31, 2018 and 2017\nJanuary 31, 2018 January 31, 2017 ASSETS Non-current assets Property, plant and equipment $ 27,119,488 $ 21,709,425 Intangible assets 15,381,578 15,499,186 Construction deposits 323,255 2,462,328 42,824,321 39,670,939 Current assets Cash - 2,831,959 Accounts receivable 6,999,212 7,035,714 Inventories 7,891,364 5,619,329 Prepaid expenses 613,710 593,180 15,504,286 16,080,182 TOTAL ASSETS 58,328,607 $ 55,751,121 LIABILITIES AND EQUITY Equity Share capital 39,747,525 39,651,096 Share-based payments reserves 1,026,667 943,565 Deficit (2,547,746 ) (2,758,560 ) TOTAL EQUITY 38,226,446 37,836,101 Non-current liabilities Provisions 538,376 411,599 Obligation under finance lease 3,011,893 3,781,855 Long-term debt 6,019,245 2,498,580 Deferred income tax liabilities 1,126,464 82,389 10,695,978 6,774,423 Current liabilities Bank Indebtedness 787,843 - Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 6,516,382 9,655,405 Current portion of obligation under finance lease 769,962 741,297 Current portion of long-term debt 1,331,996 743,895 9,406,183 11,140,597 TOTAL LIABILITIES 20,102,161 17,915,020 COMMITMENTS TOTAL LIABILITIES AND EQUITY $ 58,328,607 $ 55,751,121\nSTATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nYears ended January 31, 2018 and 2017\nJanuary 31, 2018 January 31, 2017 Operating activities Net income $ 2,602,467 $ 3,996,812 Adjustments for: Income tax expense 1,044,075 1,345,158 Finance costs 545,990 478,181 Depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangibles 3,527,762 2,875,958 Loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangibles 131,068 - Share-based payments 316,209 147,292 Change in non-cash working capital related to operations (5,422,741 ) 1,320,659 Less: Interest paid (463,782 ) (395,851 ) Cash provided by operating activities 2,281,048 9,768,209 Investing activities Purchase of property, plant and equipment (8,160,391 ) (2,578,913 ) Construction deposit paid (323,255 ) (2,462,328 ) Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment, net 2,032,266 - Purchase of intangible assets (281,417 ) (144,194 ) Cash used in investing activities (6,732,797 ) (5,185,435 ) Financing activities Increase in bank indebtedness 787,843 - Issuance of long-term debt, net of fees 5,126,215 2,000,000 Repayment of long-term debt (1,024,640 ) (1,597,179 ) Repayment of obligation under finance lease (741,297 ) (713,699 ) Dividends paid (2,391,653 ) (1,822,177 ) Issuance of shares, net of fees 60,050 45,867 Shares repurchased and cancelled, including fees (322,629 ) (266,856 ) Proceeds from stock option exercise 125,901 209,584 Cash generated from (used in) financing activities 1,619,790 (2,144,460 ) Net increase/(decrease) in cash (2,831,959 ) 2,438,314 Cash, beginning of year 2,831,959 393,645 Cash, end of year $ - $ 2,831,959 About Brick Brewing\nBrick is Ontario's largest Canadian-owned brewery.

Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \"may\", \"will\", \"expect\", \"intend\", \"anticipate\", \"seek\", \"plan\", \"believe\" or \"continue\" or the negatives of these terms or variations of them or similar terminology. Although the Corporation believes that the expectations and assumptions reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements, which are not guarantees and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, which may cause actual performance and financial results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included in this press release are made only at the date of this press release and, except as required by applicable securities laws, the Corporation does not undertake to publicly update such forward-looking statements to reflect new information, future events or otherwise.\n* EBITDA is a non-IFRS earnings measure, therefore it does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards and may not be similar to measures presented by other companies. EBITDA represents earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, gain on disposal of property, plant, and equipment, and share based payments. Management uses this measurement to evaluate the operating results of the Company. This measure is also important to management since it is used by the Company’s lenders to evaluate the ongoing cash generating capability of the Company and therefore the amounts those lenders are willing to lend to the Company. Investors find EBITDA to be useful information because it provides a measure of the Company’s operating performance.\nContact Information\nFor further information:\nDavid Birch, Chief Financial Officer\n(519) 742-2732 Ext. 106\nE-mail: info@brickbeer.com\nSource:Brick Brewing Co.
