    "text": "CALGARY, Alberta , April 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Founders Advantage Capital Corp. (TSXV:FCF) (“FAC” or the “Corporation”) is pleased to report its financial results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 (“Q4 2017” and “Annual”, respectively). For complete information, readers should refer to the full 2017 Annual Report on the Corporation’s website at www.advantagecapital.ca or to the audited consolidated financial statements and management discussion and analysis (“MD&A”), which are available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com . All amounts are presented in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated.\nStephen Reid, President and CEO, commented, “We are pleased to report our 2017 financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017. In 2017, we further diversified our investment portfolio by completing two acquisitions, successfully integrated Newton Connectivity Systems into DLC’s operations and entered into a credit facility with Sagard Credit Partners. We believe we are well positioned for additional growth in 2018 and reaffirm our previously reported 2018 Outlook that the Corporation anticipates its proportionate share of annual adjusted EBITDA from its four investees to be between $21.5 million to $22.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.”\nSelected Consolidated Financial Highlights:\nThree months ended Period ended (1) (000’s except per share amounts) December 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nRevenues $ 27,952 $ 9,277 $ 82,905 $ 22,938 Income (loss) from operations 51 (1,606 ) 5,438 (6,337 ) Adjusted EBITDA (2) 2,849 998 18,145 3,097 Adjusted EBITDA margin 10 % 11 % 22 % 14 % Net loss for the period (5,699 ) (1,916 ) (657 ) (7,279 ) Net (loss) income attributable to: Shareholders of FAC $ (6,697 ) $ (2,410 ) $ (6,212 ) $ (9,794 ) Non-controlling interests $ 998 $ 494 $ 5,555 $ 2,515 Adjusted EBITDA attributable to: Shareholders of FAC $ 333 $ (211 ) $ 7,592 $ (1,499 ) Non-controlling interests $ 2,516 $ 1,209 $ 10,553 $ 4,596 FAC proportionate share of annual adjusted EBITDA (3) $ 3,133 $ 1,812 $ 15,064 $ 6,894 Loss per share: Basic $ (0.18 ) $ (0.07 ) $ (0.17 ) $ (0.42 ) Diluted $ (0.18 ) $ (0.07 ) $ (0.17 ) $ (0.42 ) The December 31, 2017 period is for the 12 months from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017. The December 31, 2016 period is for the 15 months from October 1, 2015 to December 31, 2016. The Corporation elected to change its year end from September 30 to December 31 in 2016. One of the measures we use to assess our overall performance is adjusted EBITDA, which is a supplemental measure of our income from operations in which depreciation and amortization, finance expense and other unusual or one-time items are added back to income from operations to arrive at adjusted EBITDA. Please see the “Non-IFRS Measures” section of this document for additional information. FAC proportionate share of annual adjusted EBITDA is comprised of the adjusted EBITDA of all operating segments attributable to FAC without considering FAC corporate costs.\nReview of 2017 Annual Financial and Operational Highlights\nOverall, FAC has experienced significant growth since commencing its new business model in early 2016. Since that time, $146 million in capital has been deployed in the completion of four acquisitions and FAC has built a foundation of people and processes which will allow for additional growth without meaningful incremental resources. The timing of the acquisitions and the resulting growth renders period over period results less comparable. Highlights of 2017 significant transactions include:\nCompleted the acquisition of a 52% interest in Cape Communications International Inc. (operating as Impact Radio Accessories) (“Impact”) on March 1, 2017. Completion of a $75.0 million USD term credit facility with Sagard Credit Partners LP (“Sagard”) on June 14, 2017 (with $42.0 million drawn at closing). Completed the acquisition of a 50% interest in Astley Gilbert Limited (“AG”) on October 31, 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the Franchise segment includes a loss of $0.3 million from Newton Connectivity Systems Inc. (“NCS”) which is primarily a result of non-recurring severance costs of $0.3 million. The NCS operations had incurred a current year adjusted EBITDA loss of $1.2 million prior to undergoing restructuring in Q2, 2017. Since restructuring the operation has generated $0.9 million of adjusted EBITDA earnings. Please see the Corporation’s MD&A and financial statements for additional information relating to these financial impacts.\nIn our third quarter financial report, FAC issued updated 2017 guidance for our expected proportionate share of annual adjusted EBITDA of approximately $15.0 – $15.4 million. This outlook did not factor in any earnings from the AG acquisition that occurred on October 31, 2017 and assumed a full year of earnings from Impact. Adjusting for AG and Impact to compare to our guidance target, our adjusted proportionate share of annual adjusted EBITDA would be $15.2 million.\nQ4 2017 Overview\nThe Corporation’s financial performance improved over the same quarter in the previous year. This variance is reflective of the timing of the acquisitions, as the Q4, 2016 results included only Dominion Lending Centres Limited Partnership (“DLC”) results and a partial month for Club16 Limited Partnership (“Club16”). The Q4, 2017 quarterly results include a full quarter of results for Club16, Impact, and NCS; and two months of results for AG. Improved revenues for the quarter were partly offset by an increase in operating costs for those recent acquisitions.\nCompared to Q3, the Corporation’s adjusted EBITDA has decreased from $8.2 million to $2.8 million due primarily to seasonality of operations in the Franchise segment where Q2 and Q3 are historically the most active quarters in the mortgage broker sector. The Consumer Products and Services segments also saw a seasonal drop in earnings in Q4, as well as increased advertising costs of $0.2 million related to opening of a new facility in January, and a rent adjustment of $0.2 million. Acquisition costs in the Business Products and Services segment of $0.5 million were incurred in Q4 which also impacted adjusted EBITDA. In addition, a $1.1 million realized foreign currency loss was incurred in the Corporate and Consolidated segment related to converting the Sagard USD funds to CAD to fund the AG acquisition.\nOn a net income basis, the Q4 net income contains non-cash charges such as a $2.5 million of impairment on a legacy investment in Vital Alert Communications Inc. (full year impact of $2.5 million) and a $3.3 million fair value loss on the non-controlling interest liability related to Impact ($4.3 million full year).\nPlease see the Corporation’s MD&A and financial statements for additional information relating to these financial impacts.\nOverview of Financial Results for Segments\nWe currently operate a corporate head office and three business segments – Business Products and Services, Consumer Products and Services and Franchise. Please see the Corporation’s MD&A for a comprehensive discussion relating to the financial results for the segments.\nNon-IFRS Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA for both our corporate head office and investees is defined as earnings before finance expense, taxes, and non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, share-based payments, losses recognized on the sale of investments, and any unusual non-operating one-time items such as corporate start-up costs, reorganization costs and other revenues. Adjusted EBITDA is also adjusted for expenses relating to expenses relating to prior mineral property impairment reversal and arbitration. Readers are cautioned that adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as a substitute or an alternative to applicable generally accepted accounting principle measures as determined in accordance with IFRS. Please see the Corporation’s MD&A for a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to its nearest IFRS measure.\nAbout Founders Advantage Capital Corp.\nThe Corporation is listed on the TSX Venture Exchange as an Investment Issuer (Tier 1) and employs a permanent investment approach.
