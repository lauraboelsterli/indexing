U.S. President Donald Trump greets Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel during a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House in Washington, U.S., April 27, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n“We want trade that is in line with the multilateral trading system of (the) WTO, but we also acknowledge that for many, many years (the) WTO has not been able to bring about international agreements,” she said at a joint news conference with U.S. President Donald Trump.\n“So, I could well envisage such (bilateral) negotiations with the United States,” she added.
