John Kemper is clearly the right person to step into this role. This plan will ensure continuity and create the foundation for continued growth and long-term shareholder returns,” said Andy Taylor, executive chairman of Enterprise Holdings, Inc. and Commerce Bancshares board member and lead director.\n“I am delighted John will become CEO and continue our strong record of growth and expansion,” said David Kemper. “As chief operating officer for the past five years, John has worked with our talented management team to expand our products and geographical reach, and to deliver consistent profitable growth.”\nJohn Kemper joined Commerce in 2007 as director of strategic planning, identifying and leading key growth initiatives across the company.

I’m honored to step into this leadership role and proud to work with our exceptional management team,” said John Kemper. “As Commerce’s CEO for 30 years, David has built a best-in-class foundation for our bank and, in that time, has delivered to our shareholders total annualized returns, including dividends, of 14.1%, compared to the S&P 500 and NASDAQ bank indices of 10.7% and 9.9% respectively. Equally important, he built a team and franchise that is primed for sustainable growth well into the future.”\nIn his role as executive chairman, David Kemper, who has been with the bank since 1978 and became CEO in 1988, will continue to work full-time with the Commerce Bancshares board and executive management on issues involving strategy, customer relationships, industry engagement and civic leadership.\nJohn Kemper holds a Bachelor of Arts in history and political science from Stanford University, a Master of Science in economic history from the London School of Economics, and an MBA from Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.
