    "text": "April 20, 2018 / 4:45 AM / Updated 3 hours ago Virus hampers Watford's stomach for fight against Palace Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Several Watford players have been struck down with a stomach virus ahead of Saturday’s Premier League clash at home to Crystal Palace, manager Javi Gracia has said. Soccer Football - Premier League - Huddersfield Town vs Watford - John Smith's Stadium, Huddersfield, Britain - April 14, 2018 Watford manager Javi Gracia before the match REUTERS/Scott Heppell \nWatford have struggled in recent weeks, putting together a run of four defeats and a draw in their last five matches, and while they are still relatively comfortable in mid-table they will face a Palace side desperate for the points. \nPalace, who are 16th in the standings, will be eager to make the most of Watford’s woes and aim for a crucial win to extend their five-point advantage over 18th-placed Southampton and further stave off the threat of relegation. \nGracia said on-loan winger Gerard Deulofeu, who has been sidelined with a fractured foot, and defender Sebastian Prodl were among those hit by the virus. \n“Gerard was sick this week and there were other players who have been ill, too,” Gracia told reporters. “Prodl has also been ill all week. \n“It is a stomach virus. They are recovered, available for the match and I am sure they are in the best condition.” \nMidfielder Nathaniel Chalobah (knee surgery) and defender Younes Kaboul (fractured foot), both of whom have been sidelined since September, have started training and are expected to return to action before the end of the season. \nGracia also said that Watford were yet to set a return date for midfielder Tom Cleverley, who has been out since January due to a hamstring injury.
