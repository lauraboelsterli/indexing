Crisp white walls add an extra layer of breeziness to the ambiance as well.\nThe Agency \"The architect was very specific in how he placed the windows in the home,\" Blancarte says. \"Pretty much any window you see, it looks like a framed picture.\" Through those frames, you'll catch glimpses of the blue water lapping at the beach below.\nThe Agency Even the home theater offers ocean views. You can see them through an aquarium embedded into one of the walls. \"When you're ready to watch your movie, simply press a button, the privacy shade lowers, and you're ready to go,\" Blancarte says.\nThe master suite covers an entire floor of the property and has its own balcony.\nThe Agency The space is also perfect for little ones, with a moving train that circles the perimeter of one of the bedrooms. \"It literally looks like it's going through a cartoon book,\" Blancarte says.\nOutside, one of the home's exterior walls slides away to reveal a miniature garage fit for a golf cart.\nWatch new episodes of CNBC's \" Secret Lives of the Super Rich \" Wednesdays at 10P/ET.\nDon't miss: This $38 million LA mansion has a $450,000 speaker system and was designed by Lenny Kravitzâ€”take a look inside\nLike this story?
