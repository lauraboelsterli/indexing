AXA acquired the business in 1992 and it is targeting a second-quarter IPO of its U.S. division.\nAXA, which is Europe’s second-biggest insurer by market capitalisation behind Allianz, has said that the proceeds from its IPO deal will help finance its earlier acquisition of insurer XL Group.\nAXA announced its $15 billion acquisition of XL in March to create a world leader in property and casualty insurance.\nInsurers have been turning to takeovers to strengthen their businesses as they face tougher regulation and falling returns from financial market investments, with American International Group also buying reinsurer Validus for around $5.6 billion earlier this year.\nMorgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Barclays and Citigroup are the main investment banks involved in the IPO of AXA’s U.S. business.
