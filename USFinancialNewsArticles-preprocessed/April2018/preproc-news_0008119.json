    "text": "EditorsNote: updates to “15 of 29” in second graf, “44.6 percent” in fifth graf, “first six points” in ninth graf\nBojan Bogdanovic scored 28 points to lead the Indiana Pacers past the Golden State Warriors, 126-106, Thursday night in Indianapolis.\nBogdanovic made 11 of 13 shots, including 6 of 7 3-point attempts as the Pacers sank 15 of 29 shots from beyond the arc.\nVictor Oladipo contributed 21 points, seven assists, six rebounds and three steals, Thaddeus Young chipped in 16 points and eight rebounds, and Darren Collison added 15 points for Indiana. Domantas Sabonis finished with 13 points and nine rebounds off the bench for the Pacers, who play at Toronto on Friday night.\nIndiana remains in fifth place in the Eastern Conference with the win but could still finish as high as third with a week remaining in the regular season.\nThe Pacers shot 53.8 percent while limiting Golden State to 44.6 percent shooting. The Pacers also had a 29-10 edge in fastbreak points.\nKevin Durant scored 27 points, hitting 8 of 23 shots, and Klay Thompson scored all 16 of his points in the first half for the Warriors.\nQuinn Cook scored 12 points and Draymond Green added nine for Golden State, which saw its three-game winning streak end.\nIn addition to playing without Stephen Curry (MCL sprain), the Warriors were missing Andre Iguodala (left knee soreness).\nIndiana scored the first six points of the second half to take a 68-51 lead. The Pacers were in control from there, leading 97-77 after three quarters.\nGolden State cut the deficit in half by scoring the first 10 points of the fourth quarter before Indiana answered with 17-1 run to regain control. The one Warriors point was a Durant free throw following a technical on Oladipo.\nThe Warriors are locked into the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference.\nThe Pacers swept the two-game season series, having beaten Golden State 92-81 on March 27. The Warriors played that game without Curry, Durant, Thompson and Green.\nThe Pacers shot 52 percent in the first half to grab a 62-51 halftime lead after holding a 27-26 edge at the end of the first quarter. Bogdanovic scored 14 points on 6-of-7 shooting in the first half.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
