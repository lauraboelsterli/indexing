    "text": "(Adds broker comment, updates prices) BEIJING, April 25 (Reuters) - London aluminium dropped as much as 1.6 percent on Wednesday, retreating for a fifth straight session as the softening of U.S. sanctions on Russian producer United Company Rusal continued to weigh on prices. The metal has now slipped by around 13 percent from a high of $2,534.50 on April 23, the day the United States gave U.S. customers of Rusal more time to comply with sanctions. Most other base metals also fell on a stronger dollar, which makes metals more expensive for holders of other currencies. The three-month prompt delivery London Metal Exchange (LME) contracts are now in late July and \"moving toward the summer shutdown season, (so) metals could well come under further pressure and drift lower,\" Malcolm Freeman, CEO of Kingdom Futures, wrote in a note. FUNDAMENTALS * LME ALUMINIUM: Three-month aluminium on the London Metal Exchange was down 1.4 percent at $2,197 a tonne at 0721 GMT, having closed down 3 percent on Tuesday. Earlier in the session, it touched a low of $2,191. * SHFE ALUMINIUM: The most-traded June aluminium contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell for a fourth day, closing down 0.1 percent at 14,405 yuan ($2,282.52) a tonne. * RUSSIA: Russia's En+ Group, owned by recently sanctioned businessman Oleg Deripaska, said its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer resigned on Tuesday, with replacements appointed to both posts. * ALNORTE: Norsk Hydro ASA has halted alumina output at two of seven production lines at its Alunorte alumina refinery in Brazil, its CEO said on Wednesday. * NICKEL: London nickel climbed 0.5 percent to $14,060 a tonne, trading higher for the first time in five days after falling 8.4 percent from April 19 as fears of sanctions spreading eased. * FREEPORT: Shares of Freeport-McMoRan Inc fell more than 14 percent on Tuesday after the miner revealed onerous environmental demands from Indonesia's government that could delay a new contract for its massive Grasberg copper mine.
