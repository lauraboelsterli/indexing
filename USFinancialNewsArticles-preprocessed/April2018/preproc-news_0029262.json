    "text": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan and China agree that a trade war will have serious consequences for the world economy, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said on Monday after a high-level economic dialogue between the world’s third- and second-largest economies.\nConcern is growing about a trade row between China and the United States in which the two nations have threatened each other with tariffs. Japan has been criticised by U.S. President Donald Trump on trade and been hit with tariffs on steel and aluminium, but it has not yet threatened counter-tariffs.\n“We have shared understanding that a trade war, no matter which country has brought it about, would have a very large impact on the prosperity of the international economy,” Kono told reporters after the first such dialogue in more than seven years.\nKono and the Chinese government’s top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, co-chaired the Tokyo meeting. Wang is also foreign minister.\nFinancial markets have been roiled recently over fears that a full-blown U.S.-China trade war could shatter global trade and economic growth.\nTrade issues will likely be at the forefront of a summit between Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Trump later this week. Tokyo is eager to avoid being pushed into talks on a two-way free trade agreement aimed not only at market access but at monetary and currency policies.\nKono also said it was possible that Japan works with China on Beijing’s Belt and Road projects.\nChinese government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi meets with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Abe's official residence in Tokyo, Japan, April 16, 2018.
