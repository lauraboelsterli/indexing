    "text": "April 19, 2018 / 6:22 AM / Updated 29 minutes ago Ultra Electronics investigated by SFO for 'suspected corruption' in Algeria Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - British defence contractor Ultra Electronics ( ULE.L ) said the UK’s Serious Fraud Office had opened a criminal investigation into “suspected corruption in the conduct of business” by it in Algeria. \nUltra said in a statement on Thursday that the SFO investigation concerned the business conduct of Ultra, its subsidiaries, employees and associated persons, and came after Ultra referred itself to the British fraud authorities. \n“Given the stage of these matters, it is not possible to estimate reliably what effect the outcome of this matter may have on the group,” Ultra said, adding that it continued to co-operate with the SFO.
