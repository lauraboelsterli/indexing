    "text": "BILLINGS, Mont.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- First Interstate BancSystem, Inc. (NASDAQ: FIBK) today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2018. For the quarter, the Company reported net income of $36.7 million, or $0.65 per share, which compares to net income of $34.2 million, or $0.61 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, and $23.2 million, or $0.51 per share, for the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 earnings were impacted by the final acquisition costs related to the acquisition of Cascade Bancorp (“CACB”) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Bank of the Cascades (“BOTC”), which negatively impacted earnings by $0.03 per share.\nOn April 25, 2018, First Interstate BancSystem, Inc., also announced in a separate release the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding stock of Northwest Bancorporation, Inc., the parent company of Inland Northwest Bank (“INB”), a Spokane, Washington based community bank with 20 banking offices across Idaho, Oregon and Washington in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $160.9 million in aggregate, or $21.03 per share of INB stock. The Company believes the transaction, if completed on the terms contemplated, will complement First Interstate’s footprint, which it successfully expanded from the Mountain West to the Pacific Northwest with the completion of the BOTC acquisition in May 2017, and will provide First Interstate with a presence in several high-growth markets, including Spokane, Washington, Portland, Oregon and Coeur d’Alene, Idaho.\nHIGHLIGHTS\nNet interest margin ratio increased to 3.75% during the first quarter of 2018, a four basis point increase from the prior quarter and reflects a 26 basis point increase from the same period in the prior year. Excluding the impact of charged-off interest and interest accretion on acquired loans, the net interest margin ratio was 3.61%, an increase of nine basis points from the prior quarter and 20 basis points from the same period in the prior year. Total loans increased $32.5 million during the first quarter of 2018, or 1.6% annualized. The increase was primarily driven by commercial and construction real estate loans, partially offset by a decline in mortgage loans held for sale. Total deposits increased $91.0 million during the first quarter of 2018, or 3.7% annualized. The increase was primarily driven by interest bearing demand and savings deposits, which increased 2.4% and 1.5%, respectively, during the first quarter of 2018. Net charge-offs declined during the first quarter of 2018 to $0.7 million, a decrease of $5.3 million, or 88.3%, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Asset quality continued to improve in the first quarter of 2018, resulting in a $4.8 million, or 5.8%, decrease in non-performing assets and a $4.0 million, or 1.0%, decrease in criticized loans, in each case as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Final acquisition related expenses related to BOTC of $2.3 million this quarter, compared to $3.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The after-tax impact of acquisition related expenses on earnings per share was $0.03 and $0.04 per share for the respective periods. Employee severance related expenses of $1.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, resulting in an after-tax impact on earnings per share of $0.02. Dividends of $0.28 per common share paid during the quarter, an increase of 16.7% from dividends paid during the fourth quarter of 2017.\n“We are effectively generating profitable growth, as our first quarter earnings per share increased 27.5% over the same period in the prior year along with a significant improvement in our return on average assets and return on average equity,” said Kevin P. Riley, President and Chief Executive Officer of First Interstate BancSystem, Inc. “Our strong earnings growth reflects the accretive impact of the BOTC acquisition and the positive impact of the lower corporate tax rate. We are also seeing positive trends across most of our key metrics, including an expanded net interest margin and improved asset quality. As expected, we are generating a higher level of loan growth as we capitalize on faster growing markets in our West Division and strengthen our business development capabilities in the Mountain Division. As a result, our total loans increased $32.5 million in the first quarter of 2018, which is a notable improvement over the decline in loan balances we have historically seen during the first quarter of the year.”\n“We are excited about the opportunity to further expand our franchise with the acquisition of Northwest Bancorporation. We believe that the accretive impact of this transaction, combined with our entrance into several high growth markets in the Pacific Northwest, would further improve our level of profitability and provide greater opportunities for generating organic growth in future years,” said Mr. Riley.\nDIVIDEND DECLARATION\nOn April 25, 2018, the Company's board of directors declared a dividend of $0.28 per common share, payable on May 24, 2018, to common stockholders of record as of May 14, 2018. The dividend equates to a 2.7% annualized yield based on the $40.84 per share average closing price of the Company's common stock as reported on Nasdaq during the first quarter of 2018.\nNET INTEREST INCOME\nThe Company's net interest income, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, decreased $1.7 million, or 1.7%, to $100.3 million during the first quarter of 2018, compared to $102.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. This is primarily a result of the period having two fewer accrual days, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Net interest income, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, increased $30.3 million, or 43.3%, from $70.0 million during the first quarter of 2017, as a result of the impact of the BOTC acquisition that closed in May 2017 and an expansion to our net interest margin.\nNet interest income was positively impacted this quarter by the recovery of previously charged-off interest of $0.7 million, compared to the recovery of $1.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 and $0.4 million during the first quarter of 2017.\nInterest accretion attributable to the fair valuation of acquired loans contributed $3.1 million to net interest income during the first quarter of 2018, of which approximately $1.1 million was related to early payoffs. This compares to interest accretion of $3.8 million in net interest income during the fourth quarter of 2017, of which approximately $2.0 million was related to early payoffs and interest accretion of $1.2 million in net interest income during the first quarter of 2017, of which approximately $0.3 million was related to early payoffs.\nThe Company's net interest margin improved to 3.75% during the first quarter of 2018, or four basis points, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of reinvestment opportunities at higher rates available to us due to the short duration of our investment portfolio. Exclusive of the impact of the recovery of charged-off interest and the impact of interest accretion on acquired loans, the Company's net interest margin ratio was 3.61% during the first quarter of 2018, compared to 3.52% during the fourth quarter of 2017, and 3.41% during the first quarter of 2017.\nPROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES\nThe Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $2.1 million during the first quarter of 2018, compared to $3.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, and $1.7 million during the first quarter of 2017. As a result of lower levels of net charge-offs, the Company’s Allowance for Loan Losses as a percentage of period-end loans increased to 0.96% and coverage of non-performing loans increased to 110.0%.\nNON-INTEREST INCOME\nTotal non-interest income decreased $2.0 million, or 5.4%, to $35.2 million during the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $37.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of seasonal fluctuations and two fewer days in the quarter. Total non-interest income increased $6.1 million, or 21.0%, from $29.1 million during the first quarter of 2017, as a result of the BOTC acquisition.\nPayment services revenues decreased $1.8 million, or 14.6%, to $10.5 million during the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $12.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to seasonal fluctuations. Payment services revenues increased $2.1 million, or 25.0%, from $8.4 million during the first quarter of 2017, primarily driven by increased debit card and credit card volume in addition to the BOTC acquisition.\nMortgage banking revenues decreased $1.1 million, or 16.9%, to $5.4 million during the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $6.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, due to seasonal declines in mortgage loan production. During the first quarter of 2018, loans originated for home purchases accounted for approximately 68.2% of loan production, as compared to 68.8% during the fourth quarter of 2017 and 58.6% during the first quarter of 2017. Mortgage banking revenues decreased $1.1 million, or 16.9%, during the first quarter of 2018 from $6.5 million during the first quarter of 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the lack of demand for refinancing loans, which was strong post-election during the first quarter of 2017.\nWealth management revenues increased $0.5 million, or 9.3%, to $5.9 million during the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $5.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased $0.9 million, or 18.0%, from $5.0 million during the first quarter of 2017. These increases are primarily due to higher brokerage revenues.\nOther service charges, commissions and fee revenues increased $0.2 million, or 5.4%, to $3.9 million during the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $3.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to fees earned on interest rate swap contracts offered to customers. Other service charges, commissions and fee revenues increased $1.2 million, or 44.4%, from $2.7 million during the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to the BOTC acquisition, increases in mortgage loan servicing fee income, and additional fees earned on derivative interest rate swap contracts offered to customers.\nNON-INTEREST EXPENSE\nNon-interest expense increased $0.8 million, or 0.9%, to $85.9 million during the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $85.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to employee severance related costs and employee benefits which were offset by a decrease in acquisition related costs. Non-interest expense increased $22.2 million, or 34.9%, from $63.7 million during the first quarter of 2017 due to the BOTC acquisition.\nAcquisition related expenses for the first quarter of 2018, the fourth quarter of 2017, and the first quarter of 2017 are $2.3 million, $3.3 million, and $0.7 million, respectively. The after-tax impact of acquisition related expenses on earnings per share was $0.03, $0.04, and $0.01 per share for the respective quarterly periods. Acquisition related costs for BOTC were finalized during the first quarter of 2018 and are detailed below for the periods presented:\nQuarter Ended Mar 31,\n2018 Dec 31,\n2017 Sep 30,\n2017 Jun 30,\n2017 Mar 31,\n2017 Legal and professional fees $ 0.5 $ 0.6 $ 2.5 $ 5.9 $ 0.6 Employee expenses 0.1 — 1.7 3.3 — Technology conversion and contract terminations 1.5 2.4 7.1 0.7 — Other 0.2 0.3 1.7 0.2 0.1 Total acquisition related expenses $ 2.3 $ 3.3 $ 13.0 $ 10.1 $ 0.7 Exclusive of acquisition related expenses, non-interest expense was $83.6 million during the first quarter of 2018, compared to $81.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, with the quarter-over-quarter increase a result of $1.2 million in severance related costs, higher medical insurance, and the payroll tax reset on salaries and wages. Exclusive of acquisition related expenses, non-interest expense was $63.0 million during the first quarter of 2017, with the year-over-year increase primarily attributable to the BOTC transaction.\nSalary and wage expenses increased $0.3 million, or 0.9%, to $34.6 million during the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $34.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. Exclusive of severance related expenses, salary and wage expenses decreased $0.6 million to $33.4 million during the first quarter of 2018, compared to $34.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. Salaries and wage expenses increased $8.9 million, or 34.6%, from $25.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. This increase reflects the salaries, benefits, and incentive compensation for BOTC employees who joined the Company as it expanded into three new states in 2017.\nEmployee benefit expenses increased $3.3 million, or 41.3%, to $11.3 million during the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $8.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, as medical claims in the fourth quarter of 2017 were significantly lower than historical averages in addition to the seasonal first quarter reset of payroll taxes. Employee benefit expenses increased $1.7 million, or 17.7%, from $9.6 million during the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to the BOTC acquisition.\nOther expenses decreased $1.4 million, or 5.1%, to $26.3 million during the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $27.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. This decrease is primarily due to higher advertising and promotional expenses incurred during the fourth quarter to promote the Company's brand awareness in its new markets in the West Division. Year-over-year, other expenses increased $6.3 million, or 31.5%, from $20.0 million during the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to the acquisition of BOTC.\nIncome tax expense decreased $4.9 million during the first quarter of 2018, primarily related to a lower effective tax rate, resulting from the enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nBALANCE SHEET\nTotal assets increased $60.1 million, or 0.5%, over the linked-quarter as a result of increased investment securities and outstanding loan balances. Total assets increased $3,212.2 million, or 35.5%, to $12,273.4 million as of March 31, 2018, from $9,061.2 million as of March 31, 2017, primarily due to the BOTC acquisition.\nTotal loans increased $32.5 million, or 0.4%, to $7,646.8 million as of March 31, 2018, from $7,614.3 million as of December 31, 2017, due to organic growth primarily in commercial and construction real estate loans. Total loans increased $2,247.0 million, from $5,399.8 million as of March 31, 2017, primarily due to the BOTC acquisition.\nTotal real estate loans increased $24.6 million, or 0.5%, to $5,201.4 million as of March 31, 2018, from $5,176.8 million as of December 31, 2017. Within the portfolio, construction loans increased $27.7 million, or 3.9%, to $736.0 million as of March 31, 2018. This growth was offset by declines in commercial, residential, and agricultural real estate loans of $1.0 million, $0.8 million and $1.3 million, respectively. Total real estate loans increased $1,744.6 million, or 50.5%, from March 31, 2017, primarily due to the BOTC acquisition.\nTotal consumer loans decreased $3.3 million, or 0.3%, to $1,031.1 million as of March 31, 2018, from $1,034.4 million as of December 31, 2017, and increased $57.9 million, or 5.9%, from $973.2 million, as of March 31, 2017. The year-over-year increase is attributable to growth in the indirect portfolio in the legacy footprint, along with consumer loans acquired in the BOTC acquisition.\nCommercial loans increased $28.7 million, or 2.4%, to $1,244.1 million as of March 31, 2018, from $1,215.4 million as of December 31, 2017, as a result of organic growth across our footprint. Year-over-year, commercial loans increased $426.3 million, or 52.1%, from $817.8 million as of March 31, 2017, primarily due to the BOTC acquisition.\nAgricultural loans decreased $2.3 million, or 1.7%, to $133.9 million as of March 31, 2018, from $136.2 million as of December 31, 2017, due to seasonal reductions in operating lines that historically we have experienced during the first quarter of the year. Year-over-year, agriculture loans increased $8.4 million, or 6.7%, from $125.5 million as of March 31, 2017, primarily due to organic growth.\nGoodwill and intangible assets, excluding mortgage servicing rights, decreased $0.9 million, to $520.9 million as of March 31, 2018, from $521.8 million, as of December 31, 2017. The decrease is attributable to intangible amortization of $1.8 million during the quarter which was offset by an adjustment of $0.9 million to goodwill acquired in the BOTC acquisition. There are no remaining provisional adjustments related to the acquisition.\nTotal deposits grew organically by $91.0 million, or 0.9%, to $10,025.9 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to December 31, 2017, and increased $2,725.7 million, or 37.3%, from $7,300.2 million, as of March 31, 2017 as a result of the BOTC acquisition. As of March 31, 2018, the mix of total deposits remained consistent at 28.9% non-interest bearing demand, 28.5% interest bearing demand, 31.3% savings, and 11.3% time deposits.\nThe Company’s loan to deposit ratio was 76.3%, as of March 31, 2018, compared to 76.6% as of December 31, 2017 and up from 74.0% as of March 31, 2017.\nThe Company is considered to be “well-capitalized” as of March 31, 2018, having exceeded all regulatory capital adequacy requirements. Despite the large fluctuation in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, due to market value fluctuations in our available for sale investment portfolio, the Company maintained stable tangible common equity to tangible assets at 7.76% as of March 31, 2018. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company paid common stock dividends of approximately $15.6 million, or $0.28 per share.\nCREDIT QUALITY\nAs of March 31, 2018, non-performing assets decreased by $4.8 million, or 5.8% to $77.8 million, compared to $82.6 million as of December 31, 2017. Non-accrual loans decreased approximately $6.3 million to $63.1 million as of March 31, 2018, as compared to $69.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. Accruing loans past due 90 days or more increased $0.6 million, or 19.4%, and other real estate owned increased $0.9 million, or 8.9%, from December 31, 2017. The improvement in non-performing assets is primarily attributed to the resolution and pay down on four loans in the commercial, commercial real estate, and construction real estate categories.\nCriticized loans decreased $4.0 million, or 1.0%, to $396.5 million as of March 31, 2018, from $400.5 million as of December 31, 2017, driven primarily by several upgrades and pay downs within the commercial, commercial real estate, and construction real estate categories as noted above. Criticized loans increased $13.0 million from $383.5 million as of March 31, 2017, as a result of the loans acquired in the BOTC acquisition.\nNet loan charge-offs decreased $5.3 million to $0.7 million during the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $6.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, driven primarily by recoveries against previous losses in the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios. Net charge-offs during the first quarter of 2017 were $1.7 million.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nIn addition to results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP, this release contains the following non-GAAP financial measures that management uses to evaluate capital adequacy: (i) tangible book value per common share; (ii) tangible common stockholders' equity to tangible assets; (iii) tangible assets; (iv) tangible common stockholders' equity; and (v) return on average tangible common equity. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies because other companies may not calculate these non-GAAP measures in the same manner. As a result, the usefulness of these measures to investors may be limited, and they should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company adjusts certain capital adequacy measures to exclude intangible assets except mortgage servicing rights. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures, which are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by banking regulators, are useful to investors in evaluating the Company's performance because we exclude the impact on the Company's performance of the amortization of intangible assets (except mortgage servicing rights) which, generally speaking, does not represent an actual cash expense and is inconsistent in the amount and frequency depending upon the timing and size of our acquisitions. This impacts the ratios which are important to analysts and also allow investors to compare certain aspects of the Company's capitalization to other companies.\nSee the Non-GAAP Financial Measures table included herein for a reconciliation of the above described non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Factors that Could Affect Future Results\nThis press release contains “ ” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Rule 175 promulgated thereunder, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 3b-6 promulgated thereunder, that involve inherent risks and uncertainties.
