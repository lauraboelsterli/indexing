    "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Trade unions in Germany piled more pressure on public sector employers with a second day of nationwide wage strikes on Wednesday, as more than 25,000 workers staged walkouts at hospitals, childcare centres and waste depots.\nMembers of German public sector workers union Verdi stage a strike at the airport in demand for higher wages in Frankfurt, Germany April 10, 2018. Signs read \"Today a warning strike\" and \"We are worth it\". REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach No flights were affected by Wednesday’s action.\nOn Tuesday, walkouts caused widespread disruption to air travel, including the cancellation of hundreds of flights, leaving thousands of passengers stranded.\nThe Verdi union wants a 6 percent pay rise for 2.3 million public sector employees, but the federal government and municipalities have rejected the demand as too high. The next round of negotiations is due on April 15.\nVerdi chief Frank Bsirske told Reuters on Wednesday that employers would have to offer something concrete at the third round of talks to avoid escalation. “Anything else would be a confrontation,” he said.\nThe southern states of Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg were among the worst hit on Wednesday but walkouts and demonstrations also affected other regions, including North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany’s most populous state.\nThe president of the Bavarian civil servants’ union, Rolf Habermann, told Reuters employers should make an offer reflecting the strength of Germany’s economic upswing.\n“There have been enough words exchanged, the rituals have been maxed out,” Habermann said.\nGermany, Europe’s biggest economy, is in solid shape, with buoyant tax revenues and a record budget surplus. Falling unemployment, inflation-busting pay rises and low borrowing costs are fuelling a consumer-led upswing.\nThe European Central Bank is keeping a close eye on the German wage negotiations for any sign that wage growth is picking up, potentially lifting inflation and giving the ECB added leeway to start winding down its massive stimulus programme.\nReporting by Thorsten Severin; Writing by Charley-Kai John; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky and John Stonestreet\n ",
