    "text": "ST. LOUIS, April 11, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Tesla, BMW, Volkswagen, Panasonic and other industry leaders have created tremendous momentum behind projected electric vehicle use and resultant demand for high performance batteries; products which require significant cobalt resources. The annual demand for cobalt reached $8 billion in 2017. St. Louis businessman Stacy W. Hastie, CEO of Environmental Operations (EOI), and financier J. Randall Waterfield, CEO of Waterfield Holdings (Waterfield) announced today that Missouri Cobalt, LLC (MC), has acquired land and operational control of 1,800 acres of a former mine operation in Madison County, MO from Anschutz Mining Corporation of Denver, CO.\nBetween proven and inferred reserves, the site holds an estimated 35 million pounds of recoverable cobalt, likely making it the largest such reserve in North America. MC anticipates obtaining a mining permit from the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) and expects to be producing a cobalt product on-site in less than six months. The full MC operation, including on-site cobalt processing, will follow within two years, the company said. The site also contains an estimated 51 million pounds of nickel and 65 million pounds of copper.\nThe former Anschutz site is part of The Madison County Mines Superfund Site on the Environmental Protection Agency's National Priorities List . Another Hastie/Waterfield company, Environmental Risk Transfer (ERT), will perform the environmental remediation closure on the recently acquired site.\n\"This project represents a multi-fold opportunity for us and the community,\" said J. Randall Waterfield. \"Our affiliate, Environmental Risk Transfer, will perform remediation on the site, helping clean up the environment, while the new cobalt mining operation will create jobs and support important US renewable energy advancement.\"\n\"Our enormous reserves of cobalt, some of which are immediately available for processing, will support our national renewable energy efforts with a reliable and stable supply of this critical natural resource produced here in Missouri,\" said Stacy W. Hastie, Chairman and CEO of Environmental Operations, Inc. and a partner in MC and ERT. \"We are very excited about the unique combination of my company's responsible environmental experience and the financial strength of Waterfield to make large projects like this possible. Neither of us could take on an effort like this alone, but the strengths we each bring make us more than capable of doing so.\"\nBoth partners praised EPA Region 7 and MDNR for their collaborative approach in working through the details of a clean-up plan which will create environmental benefits and a significant number of new jobs for the Madison County area. Environmental remediation of the site will employ up to 50 people. The new mining operation will create more than 250 permanent local jobs, plus construction jobs. In total, the project will produce some 600-700 temporary and permanent jobs.\nFor more information about ERT visit the company's website .\nAbout J. Randall Waterfield\nMr. J.
