    "text": "The Sohn Investment Conference in New York kicked off Monday with hedge fund managers' picks moving markets.\nSohn is the most widely anticipated hedge fund event of the year, where managers volunteer their time and best investment ideas to raise money in the fight against childhood cancer. This year, the conference began with Next Wave Sohn, featuring the \"next generation of talent\" among hedge fund managers.\nDavid A. Grogan | CNBC The picks from these rising stars are below.\nAlexander Captain, Cat Rock Capital\nLong Takeaway.com (AMS: TKWY - Amsterdam)\nTakeaway.com is \"the most attractive online food delivery company,\" he said. \"It is well on its way to become the dominant player in Germany.\"\nCaptain said the company is a market leader in Europe. He said the global online food delivery market is just $50 billion per year inside the $2.8 trillion annual spending at restaurants.\nShares were 1 percent higher in late-day trading local time.\nTim Garry, Pelorus Jack Capital\nBearish on growth and momentum stocks\nThere is \"soon to be a price momentum beta factor crash,\" Garry said. \"Growth stocks will get crushed.\"\nThe hedge fund manager said assets flooded into \"risk parity\" and volatility compression strategies since 2013, which will now likely reverse. About 90 percent of daily volume is traded by systematic managers such as passive index funds and ETFs that do not do any fundamental analysis, he said. Garry that Nasdaq 100 volatility has been rising since February.\nRashmi Kwatra, Sixteenth Street Capital\nLong BRAC Bank (Bangladesh bank)\nBRAC is \"the best way to play the Bangladesh growth story,\" she said. \"It is the leader in mobile payments.\"\nKwatra said Bangladesh's economy has grown 6 percent annually over the last 10 years with 73 percent of its 163 million population under age 40. She said only 31 percent of the country has a bank account, providing a big penetration growth opportunity for BRAC Bank.\nOleg Nodelman, EcoR1 Capital\nLong Ascendis Pharma (ASND)\nNodelman is optimistic over the clinical stage biopharma company's drug treatment for growth hormone deficiency, TransCon, which is better than current offerings in the market.\nAscendis' \"lead asset will be on the market in two years and is worth twice its current market cap,\" he said.\nShares rose fractionally in morning trade. Nodelman put a fair value target price on the company of $289, which would be a more than 350 percent gain from the current level.\nScott Goodwin, Diameter Capital Partners\nBuy 3-year credit default swaps on Rallye (a negative bet on the company's bonds)\nRallye \"is a margin loan on a levered grocery conglomerate,\" he said.\nThe fund manager said Rallye owns 50.1 percent of a levered, or highly indebted, French grocer under competitive pressure. He noted the company is \"burning a material amount of cash\" and has a significant amount of debt due in the next 12 months.\nCredit default swaps are insurance against a default on corporate bonds. If the bond defaults, the CDS owners get a payoff.\nPlease check back for updates",
