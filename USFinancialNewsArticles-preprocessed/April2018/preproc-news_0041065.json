    "text": "The fatal incident on a Southwest Airlines flight on Tuesday has sparked a safety debate, with the Federal Aviation Administration preparing to order far-reaching inspections of the engine type believed to be responsible for the accident.\nThe CFM56 engine on Southwest Flight 1380 blew apart over Pennsylvania on Tuesday, about 20 minutes after the Dallas, Texas-bound flight left New York’s LaGuardia Airport with 149 people on board.

Other passengers were injured when shrapnel shot through the plane’s interior.\nTo read the full story on Westlaw Practitioner Insights, click here: bit.ly/2JcoOQa\n ",
