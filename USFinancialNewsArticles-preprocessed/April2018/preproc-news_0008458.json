Greager as Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Greager’s appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer will take effect on April 11, 2018. He will be assuming the role from R.

Most recently, Mr. Greager led Encana’s Western Operating Area, which includes Eagle Ford, San Juan and Wind River assets. Mr. Greager’s experience with both the operating and technical aspects of the D-J Basin and his demonstrated leadership of several units within Encana have led the Board of Directors of Bonanza Creek to conclude that he will be a superb leader of the Company as it executes its development plan.\n“After a comprehensive search and on behalf of the Board of Directors, we are pleased to welcome Eric Greager to Bonanza Creek. Eric has the right background, leadership and cultural disposition to successfully lead our Company. He has a track record of success and continuous improvement, and we are confident that he will help strengthen Bonanza Creek, drive returns and cash flow growth, and create value for our shareholders, employees and community. Eric is a terrific asset, and we are excited to welcome him to the team,” said Jack E. Vaughn, Chairman of Bonanza Creek. “On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would also like to thank Seth for all of his hard work leading Bonanza Creek over the past ten months.”\nIn accordance with NYSE requirements, the Company hereby discloses that its Board of Directors has authorized the grant to Mr. Greager of an employment inducement award of restricted stock units with a grant-date fair value equal to $4,000,000 (the “Inducement RSUs”) to compensate Mr. Greager for forfeited equity compensation from his former employer, such grant to be effective on April 11, 2018, the date Mr. Greager will commence employment with the Company. The Inducement RSUs will vest in 20% increments on each of the first through fifth anniversaries of the grant date, subject to Mr. Greager’s continued employment with the Company through such date; and will vest in full upon certain qualifying terminations of employment.\nAbout Bonanza Creek Energy, Inc.\nBonanza Creek Energy, Inc. is an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development and production of onshore oil and associated liquids-rich natural gas in the United States.
