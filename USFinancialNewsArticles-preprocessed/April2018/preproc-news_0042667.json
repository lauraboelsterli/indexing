    "text": "April 20, 2018 / 1:24 PM / Updated 37 minutes ago Takeda weighs raising Shire bid to more than 47 pounds per share - sources Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Japan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd ( 4502.T ) is considering raising its cash-and-stock bid for London-listed drug maker Shire Plc ( SHP.L ) to approximately 47 pounds per share or more, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. FILE PHOTO: Takeda Pharmaceutical's signboard is seen on its headquarters building in Tokyo, Japan January 30, 2018. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo \nTakeda is still finalising its latest offer, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. On Thursday, the companies disclosed that Shire had rejected Takeda’s third indicative bid of 46.50 pounds per share. \nTakeda and Shire did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
