For the first quarter, parts and services organic revenue growth was 3.7% and acquisition revenue growth was 6.6%, while the impact of exchange rates was 5.4%, for total parts and services revenue growth of 15.7%.\nNet income from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders for the first quarter of 2018 was $153 million, an increase of 9% as compared to $141 million for the same period of 2017. On an adjusted basis, net income from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders was $170 million, an increase of 11% as compared to the $153 million for the same period of 2017. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.49, an increase of 9% as compared to the $0.45 for the same period of 2017. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.55, an increase of 12% as compared to the $0.49 for the same period of 2017. Dominick Zarcone, President and Chief Executive Officer of LKQ Corporation, stated, “I am very pleased with the 6.5% organic parts and services growth in our North America segment. Although we faced a few revenue headwinds in Europe and our Specialty business and experienced certain near-term cost pressures in the quarter, we are actively addressing the issues and I am confident that we have solid plans to quickly return to our historical levels of growth and profitability.”\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nCash flow from operations totaled $145 million during the first quarter of 2018, and the Company invested approximately $62 million in capital expenditures and other long term assets for continuing operations. As of March 31, 2018, LKQ’s balance sheet reflected cash and equivalents of $246 million and outstanding debt of $3.3 billion. Total availability under the Company’s credit facilities at March 31, 2018 was approximately $1.5 billion.\nOther Events\nOn March 22, 2018, the Company priced an offering of €1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes. The offering consisted of €750 million 3.625% senior notes due 2026 (the “2026 notes”) and €250 million 4.125% senior notes due 2028 (the “2028 notes” and, together with the 2026 notes, the “notes”). LKQ European Holdings B.V. will pay interest on the notes semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing on October 1, 2018. The 2026 notes will mature on April 1, 2026, and the 2028 notes will mature on April 1, 2028. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by LKQ Corporation and each of its domestic wholly-owned subsidiaries that are guarantors under its senior secured credit facility. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering, together with borrowings under its senior secured credit facility, (i) to finance a portion of the consideration payable for the pending Stahlgruber GmbH acquisition, (ii) for general corporate purposes and (iii) to pay related fees and expenses, including the refinancing of net financial debt. The note offering closed on April 9, 2018.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, LKQ acquired an aftermarket radiator and related products distributor in Tennessee. Also in the first quarter, LKQ’s European operations opened one branch in Western Europe and four branches in Eastern Europe.\nCompany Outlook\nThe Company updated its guidance for 2018.\nUpdated Guidance Prior Guidance Organic revenue growth for parts & services 4.0% to 5.5% 4.0% to 6.0% Net income from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders $611 million to $641 million $646 million to $676 million Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders* $685 million to $715 million $720 million to $750 million Diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders $1.96 to $2.06 $2.07 to $2.16 Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders* $2.20 to $2.30 $2.30 to $2.40 Cash flows from operations $625 million to $675 million $650 million to $700 million Capital expenditures $235 million to $265 million $250 million to $280 million *Non-GAAP measures.

26.6 % Less: Currency impact 5.4 % 14.1 % Revenue growth at constant currency 10.3 % 12.5 % We have presented the growth of our revenue on both an as reported and a constant currency basis. The constant currency presentation, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe providing constant currency revenue information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our growth, consistent with how we evaluate our performance, as this statistic removes the translation impact of exchange rate fluctuations, which are outside of our control and do not reflect our operational performance. Constant currency revenue results are calculated by translating prior year revenue in local currency using the current year's currency conversion rate. This non-GAAP financial measure has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our use of this term may vary from the use of similarly-titled measures by other issuers due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation. In addition, not all companies that report revenue growth on a constant currency basis calculate such measure in the same manner as we do and, accordingly, our calculations are not necessarily comparable to similarly-named measures of other companies and may not be appropriate measures for performance relative to other companies.\nThe following unaudited table compares revenue and Segment EBITDA by reportable segment:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (In thousands) % of\nRevenue % of\nRevenue Revenue North America $ 1,329,843 $ 1,208,240 Europe 1,040,430 820,897 Specialty 351,792 314,934 Eliminations (1,301 ) (1,228 ) Total revenue $ 2,720,764 $ 2,342,843 Segment EBITDA North America $ 177,713 13.4 % $ 176,135 14.6 % Europe 75,534 7.3 % 78,694 9.6 % Specialty 41,969 11.9 % 35,441 11.3 % Total Segment EBITDA $ 295,216 10.9 % $ 290,270 12.4 % We have presented Segment EBITDA solely as a supplemental disclosure that offers investors, securities analysts and other interested parties useful information to evaluate our segment profit and loss. We calculate Segment EBITDA as EBITDA excluding restructuring and acquisition related expenses, change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, other acquisition related gains and losses and equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. EBITDA, which is the basis for Segment EBITDA, is calculated as net income excluding noncontrolling interest, discontinued operations, depreciation, amortization, interest and income tax expense. Our chief operating decision maker, who is our Chief Executive Officer, uses Segment EBITDA as the key measure of our segment profit or loss. We use Segment EBITDA to compare profitability among our segments and evaluate business strategies. We also consider Segment EBITDA to be a useful financial measure in evaluating our operating performance, as it provides investors, securities analysts and other interested parties with supplemental information regarding the underlying trends in our ongoing operations. Segment EBITDA includes revenue and expenses that are controllable by the segment. Corporate and administrative expenses are allocated to the segments based on usage, with shared expenses apportioned based on the segment's percentage of consolidated revenue.\nThe following unaudited table reconciles Net Income to EBITDA and Segment EBITDA:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (In thousands)\nNet income $ 152,763 $ 136,278 Less: net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (197 ) — Net income attributable to LKQ stockholders 152,960 136,278 Subtract: Net loss from discontinued operations — (4,531 ) Net income from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders 152,960 140,809 Add: Depreciation and amortization 56,458 48,656 Depreciation and amortization - cost of goods sold 4,608 1,948 Interest expense, net 28,515 23,988 Provision for income taxes 49,584 72,155 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) 292,125 287,556 Subtract: Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries 1,412 214 Add: Restructuring and acquisition related expenses 4,054 2,928 Inventory step-up adjustment - acquisition related 403 — Change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities 46 — Segment EBITDA $ 295,216 $ 290,270 EBITDA as a percentage of revenue 10.7 % 12.3 % Segment EBITDA as a percentage of revenue 10.9 % 12.4 % We have presented EBITDA solely as a supplemental disclosure that offers investors, securities analysts and other interested parties useful information to evaluate our operating performance and the value of our business.

EBITDA provides insight into our profitability trends and allows management and investors to analyze our operating results with and without the impact of noncontrolling interest, discontinued operations, depreciation, amortization, interest and income tax expense. We believe EBITDA is used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in evaluating the operating performance and the value of other companies, many of which present EBITDA when reporting their results.\nWe have presented Segment EBITDA solely as a supplemental disclosure that offers investors, securities analysts and other interested parties useful information to evaluate our segment profit and loss and underlying trends in our ongoing operations.

In addition, not all companies that report EBITDA or Segment EBITDA information calculate EBITDA or Segment EBITDA in the same manner as we do and, accordingly, our calculations are not necessarily comparable to similarly named measures of other companies and may not be appropriate measures for performance relative to other companies.\nThe following unaudited table reconciles Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share to Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to LKQ Stockholders and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Attributable to LKQ Stockholders, respectively:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (In thousands, except per share data) Net income $ 152,763 $ 136,278 Less: net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (197 ) — Net income attributable to LKQ stockholders 152,960 136,278 Subtract: Net loss from discontinued operations — (4,531 ) Net income from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders 152,960 140,809 Adjustments - continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders: Amortization of acquired intangibles 22,262 21,300 Restructuring and acquisition related expenses 4,054 2,928 Inventory step-up adjustment - acquisition related 403 — Change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities 46 — Excess tax benefit from stock-based payments (2,641 ) (3,256 ) Tax effect of adjustments (6,959 ) (8,540 ) Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders $ 170,125 $ 153,241 Weighted average diluted common shares outstanding 311,347 310,300 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders: Reported $ 0.49 $ 0.45 Adjusted $ 0.55 $ 0.49 We have presented Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Attributable to LKQ Stockholders as we believe these measures are useful for evaluating the core operating performance of our continuing business across reporting periods and in analyzing the company’s historical operating results. We define Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Attributable to LKQ Stockholders as Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share adjusted to eliminate the impact of noncontrolling interest, discontinued operations, restructuring and acquisition related expenses, amortization expense related to acquired intangibles, the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, other acquisition-related gains and losses, excess tax benefits and deficiencies from stock-based payments, adjustments to the estimated tax reform provisions recorded in 2017 and any tax effect of these adjustments. The tax effect of these adjustments is calculated using the effective tax rate for the applicable period or for certain discrete items the specific tax expense or benefit for the adjustment. These financial measures are used by management in its decision making and overall evaluation of operating performance of the company and are included in the metrics used to determine incentive compensation for our senior management. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Attributable to LKQ Stockholders should not be construed as alternatives to Net Income or Diluted Earnings per Share as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In addition, not all companies that report Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Attributable to LKQ Stockholders calculate such measures in the same manner as we do and, accordingly, our calculations are not necessarily comparable to similarly-named measures of other companies and may not be appropriate measures for performance relative to other companies.\nThe following unaudited table reconciles Forecasted Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Attributable to LKQ Stockholders to Forecasted Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to LKQ Stockholders and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Attributable to LKQ Stockholders, respectively:\nForecasted Fiscal Year 2018 Minimum\nGuidance Maximum\nGuidance (In millions, except per share data) Net income from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders $ 611 $ 641 Adjustments: Amortization of acquired intangibles 100 100 Restructuring and acquisition related expenses 4 4 Excess tax benefit from stock-based payments (3 ) (3 ) Tax effect of adjustments (27 ) (27 ) Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders $ 685 $ 715 Weighted average diluted common shares outstanding 312 312 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders: U.S. GAAP $ 1.96 $ 2.06 Non-GAAP (Adjusted) $ 2.20 $ 2.30 We have presented forecasted Adjusted Net Income and forecasted Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Attributable to LKQ Stockholders in our financial guidance.
