    "text": "SEOUL, April 6 (Reuters) - South Koreaâ€™s LG Electronics Inc said on Friday first-quarter operating profit likely rose 20 percent from a year earlier, beating market expectations.\nLG estimated January-March profit at 1.1 trillion won ($1.03 billion) versus a Thomson Reuters StarMine SmartEstimate of 935 billion won from a poll of 16 analysts.\nRevenue likely climbed 3 percent to 15.1 trillion won, compared with a 15.4 trillion won projected by SmartEstimate, which gives greater weight to recent estimates by analysts who are more consistently accurate.\nThe firm will disclose full results at the end of April. ($1 = 1,068.9000 won) (Reporting by Joyce Lee; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier)\n ",
