    "text": "CERNOBBIO, Italy (Reuters) - Fears of a trade war fueled U.S. moves on tariffs, are already raising borrowing costs by hurting stock markets and creating uncertainty, a European Central Bank board member said on Friday.\nFILE PHOTO: Benoit Coeure, board member of the European Central Bank (ECB), is photographed during an interview with Reuters journalists at the ECB headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany, May 17, 2017. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach “Falls in equity prices in response to the U.S. announcement to impose a tariff on steel and aluminum, and prevailing uncertainty on the scope of any retaliatory measures, have already contributed to tighter financial conditions,” Benoit Coeure said at an event in Cernobbio, Italy.\nReporting By Mark Bendeich, writing by Francesco Canepa in Frankfurt; editing by John Stonestreet\n ",
