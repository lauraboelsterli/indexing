    "text": "SEATTLE, April 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EchoNous , the parent company of Signostics , is applying the emerging field of artificial intelligence (AI) with the extreme miniaturization of ultrasound to solve common everyday problems in health care. At the 2018 AONE Conference from April 12-15 in Indianapolis, the company will be demonstrating the EchoNous Vein 1 – a new, best-in-class tool designed to improve first-time peripheral IV (PIV) placement.\nThe soon-to-be released EchoNous Vein is designed specifically for nurses inserting peripheral IV catheters by providing an immediate and clear image of veins using just two-button controls. The easy-to-use device also includes optimized settings for use with adults and pediatrics.\nAs one of the most commonly performed minimally-invasive procedures, and the gateway to further treatment, PIV placement can be challenging due to chronic illness, chemotherapy, obesity and drug abuse, with first-attempt IV catheter insertions failing in up to 26% of adults and 54% of children according to an article published in the Journal of Nursing Infusion 2 .\n“We believe our new vein finding tool can turn around the adult and pediatric trends for IV insertion failures and help contribute to improving performance on HCAHPS patient satisfaction surveys,” said Goodwin. “We are enthusiastic about attending AONE and meeting nurse executives face to face about their concerns.\n2018 AONE attendees are encouraged to learn more about the EchoNous Vein by visiting Booth #1345 during the conference.\n1 This device is currently 510(k) pending.
