(OTC PINK:SBAZ) (“Company”), the holding company for Mohave State Bank (“Bank”), today announced net income increased 29.4% to $1.85 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to net income of $1.43 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017. In the preceding quarter, the Company reported earnings of $1.54 million, or $0.19 per diluted share.\n“We started 2018 with another quarter of increased profitability, supported by strong loan and deposit growth and a stable net interest margin,” stated Brian M. Riley, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We are well positioned to continue growing, as we focus on building a steady, well-diversified community bank in Arizona. At the same time, we maintain high levels of liquidity to fund internal growth or to provide capital for opportunities in our market.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights:\nNet income increased 29.4% to $1.85 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared to $1.43 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, in 1Q17.

Core deposits comprised 89.4% of total deposits.\nNet interest margin was 3.78% in the first quarter 2018 compared to 3.86% in the preceding quarter and 3.89% in the first quarter a year ago. Average cost of funds rose slightly to 22 basis points, as the Company increased overall deposit rates to remain competitive in the market place.\nThe provision for loan losses was $35,000 during the first quarter of 2018, with net recoveries of $15,000. The allowance for loan losses totaled $3.4 million at March 31, 2018, or 0.93% of total loans. Excluding acquired loans, the reserve ratio was 1.08%, which is in line with industry peers.
