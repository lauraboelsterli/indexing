    "text": "  Everton boss Allardyce says fan survey was a 'marketing slip-up' Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Everton boss Sam Allardyce said a survey sent to supporters asking them to rate his performance from zero to 10 was “a marketing slip-up” and he has received an apology from club chairman Bill Kenwright. Soccer Football - Premier League - Swansea City vs Everton - Liberty Stadium, Swansea, Britain - April 14, 2018 Everton manager Sam Allardyce before the match Action Images via Reuters/Andrew Boyers \nThe survey was sent earlier this week and asked a supporters’ panel a series of question designed to discover how connected they feel to the Merseyside club. \nFormer England manager Allardyce said it was an error from the club’s marketing department. \n“The survey passed out by the director of marketing was a slip-up,” he told reporters on Thursday. “His knowledge is about marketing and not football. He got things wrong. \n“I’m planning for the future, until someone tells me otherwise.” \nWhen asked if he had received an apology from the club, Allardyce added: “Off the chairman, yes.” \nAllardyce has guided Everton to ninth in the Premier League after taking 27 points from 20 matches since replacing the sacked Ronald Koeman. \nYet there has been a growing discontent among fans over the quality of football the team are playing. \nEverton striker Wayne Rooney has praised Allardyce for making an instant impact at Goodison Park and steering the club clear of the relegation battle. \n“He has done the job that’s been asked of him,” the 32-year-old told Sky Sports. \n“When he took over we were 17th in the league. We’re sitting here now in ninth position. \n“We were panicking a bit when he took over. There was talk of relegation and he has steadied that. We’re in ninth position and could possibly finish eighth.” \nEverton host 10th-placed Newcastle United at Goodison Park in the league on Monday.
