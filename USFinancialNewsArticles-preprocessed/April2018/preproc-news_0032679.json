Nickel jumped the most in 6-1/2 years on talk Nornickel - the world’s second-biggest producer of the metal - could be targeted.\nAluminium prices reached their highest since 2011, its raw material alumina touched an all-time peak, while iron ore leapt 5 percent. Such increases, if sustained, could fuel inflationary pressures and investors hedged by selling sovereign bonds.\nYields on U.S. two-year Treasuries stood at levels last visited in 2008 at 2.43 percent and 10-year German yields went above 0.55 percent for the first time in almost a month.\n“If oil prices were to move toward $80 a barrel and euro weakened a bit, there could be some inflation pressure,” said Rabobank’s head of macro strategy Elwin de Groot.\n“That usually has a negative impact on spending and could do here, especially if it comes on the back of these trade and geopolitical tensions.”\nEXTRA ENERGY Resource stocks were the big winners, driving Chinese blue chips up 1.1 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.9 percent, with energy up over 2.6 percent.\nJapan’s Nikkei faded late in the day to end up 0.15 percent, but basic materials and utilities both climbed more than 2 percent.\nIndustrial and commodities-focused stocks also led the pack in London, Paris, Frankfurt and Milan though the pan-regionally STOXX 600 was showing some signs of fatigue after a two-day rally had taken it to a six-week high.\nThe bullish sentiment in markets comes amid wider optimism about economic growth. The global economy is expected to expand this year at its fastest pace since 2010, the latest Reuters polls of over 500 economists worldwide suggest, but trade protectionism could quickly slow it down.\nInvestors were also relieved that no new U.S. demands on trade came out of a summit between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. President Donald Trump.\nE-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were pointing to a steady start in New York later.\nWall Street had also seen hefty gains in the energy and industrial indexes, though that was offset by softness in sectors such as consumer staples and financials.\nIBM’s 7.5 percent drop was the biggest drag on the S&P after the technology company’s quarterly profit margins missed Wall Street targets.\nThe Dow ended down 0.16 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 0.08 percent and the Nasdaq 0.19 percent.\nIn currency markets, the U.S. dollar remained rangebound with its index a fraction firmer at 89.669. It gained a touch on the yen to 107.46 yen, but stayed short of recent peaks at 107.78.\nThe euro hovered at $1.2383, within striking distance of the week’s top of $1.2413, while Turkey’s lira fell back 0.6 percent having had its best day in more than a year on Wednesday after President Tayyip Erdogan declared early elections.\n“The conventional wisdom is that (political) stability, even if it is not the form that you might choose - allows investment flows to continue.” said Tom Clarke, a cross-asset co-portfolio manager at William Blair Funds.\nThe strength in commodity prices helped the Australian dollar easily weather unexpectedly soft jobs data, with employment rising by a meagre 4,900 in March.\nFigures out from New Zealand also showed annual inflation there had slowed to just 1.1 percent in the first quarter, underlining expectations that interest rates would remain at record lows for many more months to come.\nAdditional reporting by Wayne Cole in Sydney Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ",
