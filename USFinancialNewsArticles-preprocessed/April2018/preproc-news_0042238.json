    "text": "EXTON, Pa., April 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Omega Flex, Inc (NASDAQ:OFLX) today reported its results of operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018:\nOMEGA FLEX, INC. (OFLX) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net Sales $ 25,397,000 $ 25,607,000 Income before Income Taxes $ 5,587,000 $ 6,188,000 Net Income attributable to Omega Flex, Inc. $ 4,163,000 $ 4,138,000 Earnings Per Share - Basic and Diluted $ 0.41 $ 0.41 Weighted Average Shares - Basic and Diluted 10,091,822 10,091,822 Kevin R. Hoben, President and CEO , announced that the Company’s Net Sales for the first quarter of 2018 were essentially level with the previous year, being $25,397,000 and $25,607,000, respectively, decreasing $210,000 or 0.8%. Kevin Hoben stated, “The numbers for seasonally adjusted housing starts were down 4% in early 2018 compared to last year. Additionally, we believe that the results in first quarter of 2017, which was the best first quarter in the Company’s history, were enhanced by customers buying ahead of a pending price increase in 2017.”\nThe Company’s Income before Income Taxes were $5,587,000 and $6,188,000, for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively, down $601,000, or 9.7%. The Company experienced a slight increase in manufacturing expenses. Operating costs were also higher, partially associated with the launch of the Company’s new MediTrac ® corrugated medical tubing product, for which there are currently no sales. Mr. Hoben stated, “All things considered, the Company’s performance in the first quarter of 2018 was very satisfactory.”\nThe Company’s Net Income for the first three months of 2018 increased $25,000 or 0.6%, being $4,163,000 and $4,138,000 for 2018 and 2017, respectively. A lower tax rate was in effect during 2018 primarily attributable to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted at the end of 2017.\nINFORMATION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS – This news release contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to inherent uncertainties which are difficult to predict, and may be beyond the ability of Omega Flex to control.
