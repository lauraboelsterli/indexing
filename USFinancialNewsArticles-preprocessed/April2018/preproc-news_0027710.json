Each Warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire one Ordinary Share at a price of CAD$0.60 until April 12, 2021.\nThe Offering was conducted by a syndicate of underwriters co-led by Echelon Wealth Partners Inc. and PI Financial Corporation and including Mackie Research Capital Corporation and Jett Capital Advisors LLC (collectively, the “ Underwriters ”). In connection with closing of the Offering, the Company paid the Underwriters a cash commission equal to 6.5% of the gross proceeds of the Offering. In addition, Aguia has granted the Underwriters an over-allotment option to purchase up to an additional 2,142,870 Units at the offering price, exercisable for a period of 30 days after closing. If the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the gross proceeds from the Offering will be approximately CAD$5.75 million.\nSulliden Mining Capital Inc., a large shareholder of Aguia, placed the lead order for the Offering.\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Offering to initiate Phase 1 exploration on its Canhada Copper Discovery, finalize permitting at its Tres Estrada phosphate project and for general corporate and working capital purposes.\nManaging Director Justin Reid commented, “We are extremely pleased with the results of the private placement.
