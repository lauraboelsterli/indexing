(TSX:ASND) (OTCQX:ASDRF) (FRA:2D9) (\"Ascendant\" or the \"Company”) announces production results from its El Mochito mine for the first quarter of 2018 demonstrating its continued production improvements highlighted by an average head grade of 6.1% ZnEq, which is a significant improvement over the fourth quarter average head grade of 5.3% ZnEq, and a strong closing cash balance of US$13.1 million as at March 31, 2018. Contained metal production for the quarter was 21.4 million ZnEq lbs, an increase of 9% over the fourth quarter 2017 and 57% over the first quarter 2017.\nQ1 2018 Operational Performance\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Ascendant produced record contained zinc equivalent metal production of 21.4 million ZnEq lbs, compared to 19.6 million ZnEq lbs in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 13.7 million lbs in the first quarter of 2017. This is Ascendant’s fifth consecutive quarter of production increases. Zinc grades showed a significant improvement through the quarter increasing by 14% from 3.7% zinc in Q4 2017 to 4.2% zinc in Q1 2018. Lead and silver grades similarly showed an increase of 16% and 34 g/t respectively to 1.6% lead and 46 g/t silver from the fourth quarter of 2017.\nIncreased control of dilution and a firm focus on mining less sub-grade material in most areas of the mine drove the substantial increase in head grades. Notably, mining from the relatively higher-grade Esperanza orebody accelerated in the first quarter with the completion of development at its first long hole stope. The success at Esperanza was partially offset by higher than expected internal dilution experienced in the Nueva Este long 23L hole stope, which has now been depleted.\nMilled production for the quarter was 186,955, compared to fourth quarter 2017 of 198,354, representing a slight decrease of 6%. The mill encountered a number of small stoppages due to wet ore and large rocks impacting the vibrating screen and cone crusher. Overall, throughput rates continue to trend higher as additional new equipment continues to be introduced into the mining fleet and new lower cost long hole stopes constitute more of total production. The remainder of the new equipment is expected to arrive by mid-2018, completing the full underground fleet replacement program that commenced in the second quarter 2017.\nRecovery rates have improved returning to levels seen earlier in 2017. Management expect tonnes processed and ore grades to trend higher during the course of the year.\nOperational performance for Q1 2018 relative to 2017 is provided in the table below:\n2018 2017 Units Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Ore Milled tonnes 186,955 198,354 176,035 150,785 131,116 Average Head Grade Zinc % 4.2 % 3.7 % 3.5 % 3.4 % 3.4 % Lead % 1.6 % 1.4 % 1.5 % 1.3 % 1.3 % Silver g/t 46 34 38 49 52 Zinc equivalent grade* % 6.1 % 5.3 % 5.4 % 5.5 % 5.6 % Average Recoveries Zinc % 89.3 % 88.5 % 88.8 % 88.9 % 89.8 % Lead % 76.7 % 74.6 % 73.7 % 72.3 % 76.9 % Silver % 78.3 % 75.0 % 78.0 % 79.3 % 78.8 % Contained Metal Production Zinc 000's lbs 15,301 14,133 12,100 9,933 8,888 Lead 000's lbs 5,125 4,556 4,175 3,216 2,957 Silver ozs 215,599 169,039 168,181 188,245 173,041 Zinc equivalent metal* 000's lbs 21,412 19,576 17,495 15,377 13,672 *Calculated from average Q1 2018 realised metal prices of US$1.55/lb for zinc, US$1.14 for lead, and US$16.72 Ag for silver\nPresident and CEO Chris Buncic stated: “In the first quarter we continued to build upon our successful operational turnaround at the El Mochito mine. The team has demonstrated a greater understanding of the ore body, mine plan and plant, and continues to show adaptability and improved operational efficiencies. We are very pleased to have been able to deliver strong growth in payable pounds on a metal basis and exit the quarter with over $13 million in cash, putting us on track for our EBITDA and free cash flow generation projections for 2018.”\nHe continued, “The new NI 43-101 reserve and resource estimate announced on April 10, 2018 gives us great confidence in the ability of the El Mochito mine to deliver a long and successful future as indicated by the seven-year mine life in Reserves. In the second quarter we look forward to incorporating this significant resource growth while continuing to improve operations and deliver on further free cash flow generation and improved contribution margins.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Conference Call\nAscendant plans to release first quarter 2018 financial results after market close on May 9, 2018.

After acquiring the mine in December 2016, Ascendant implemented a rigorous optimization program aimed at restoring the historic potential of the El Mochito mine. In 2017, the Company successfully completed the operational turnaround it set out to achieve with sustained production at record levels and profitability restored. The Company now remains focused on cost reduction and further operational improvements to drive robust free cash flow in 2018 and beyond. Ascendant is also focused on expanding and upgrading known resources through extensive exploration work for near-term growth. With a significant land package of 11,000 hectares and an abundance of historical data there are several regional targets providing longer term exploration upside which could lead to further resource growth. The Company is also engaged in the evaluation of producing and development stage mineral resource opportunities, on an ongoing basis. The Company's common shares are principally listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol \"ASND\".

In accordance with NI-43-101, the terms “mineral reserves”, “proven mineral reserve”, “probable mineral reserve”, “mineral resource”, “measured mineral resource”, “indicated mineral resource” and “inferred mineral resource” are defined in the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the “CIM”) Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves adopted by the CIM Council on May 10, 2014. While the terms “mineral resource”, “measured mineral resource”, “indicated mineral resource” and “inferred mineral resource” are recognized and required by NI 43-101, the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”) does not recognize them. The reader is cautioned that, except for that portion of mineral resources classified as mineral reserves, mineral resources do not have demonstrated economic value. Inferred mineral resources have a high degree of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be economically or legally mined. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of any inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Therefore, the reader is cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists, that it can be economically or legally mined, or that it will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Likewise, you are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of a measured or indicated mineral resource will ever be upgraded into mineral reserves.\nReaders should be aware that the Company’s financial statements (and information derived therefrom) have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and are subject to Canadian auditing and auditor independence standards. IFRS differs in some respects from United States generally accepted accounting principles and thus the Company’s financial statements (and information derived therefrom) may not be comparable to those of United States companies.\nForward Looking Information\nThis news release contains \"forward-looking statements\" and \"forward-looking information\" (collectively, \"forward-looking information\") within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation.
