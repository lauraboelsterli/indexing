    "text": "RUTHERFORD, N.J., April 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cancer Genetics, Inc. (Nasdaq:CGIX), a leader in enabling precision medicine for oncology through molecular markers and diagnostics, today announced that it has completed the sale of BioServe Biotechnologies (India) Private Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cancer Genetics to biomedical research company, REPROCELL Incorporated, for $1.9 million.\nUnder the terms of the definitive agreement, Cancer Genetics received an upfront payment of $1.6 million in cash from REPROCELL. The remaining balance will be payable approximately 6 months from closing and is subject to BioServe’s revenues for a four month period post-closing being equivalent to the same four month period in 2017.\n“The sale of BioServe to REPROCELL is consistent with our 2018 transformation and strategic plan to focus our business and execute against a path to profitability. We expect this transaction will be beneficial to the Company and our shareholders,\" said Jay Roberts, Interim Chief Executive Officer and COO of Cancer Genetics. “For CGI, this divestiture is one of several deliberate actions to focus our business, simplify our operating structure and generate monetary value to help fund new programs and assist in reducing overall operating expenses. Additionally, as part of our forward looking strategy, we intend to explore licensing opportunities with REPROCELL, among other business partners internationally, to bring our vast test and services menu to other regions with high demand and volume expectations. Overall, we remain focused on developing and bringing to market unique and innovative diagnostic assets from our industry leading pipeline and collaborating with biopharma companies to augment their therapeutics development capabilities.”\nThe Company announced on April 2, 2018 that it has engaged Raymond James & Associates, Inc. as a financial advisor to assist with evaluating options for the Company’s strategic direction. These options may include raising additional capital, the acquisition of another company and / or complementary assets, the sale of the Company, or another type of strategic partnership. The Company’s Board of Directors is committed to evaluating all potential strategic opportunities and to pursuing the path most likely to create both near- and longer-term value for Cancer Genetics’ shareholders.\nABOUT CANCER GENETICS\nCancer Genetics, Inc. is a leader in enabling precision medicine in oncology from bench to bedside through the use of oncology biomarkers and molecular testing.
