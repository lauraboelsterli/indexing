    "text": "New Board Members Bring Deep Experience in Entrepreneurship and Technology Law\nPHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Arizona Technology Council today announced it has appointed Bob La Loggia, founder and CEO, AppointmentPlus; and Ralph W. Selitto Jr., shareholder, Greenberg Traurig LLP, to its board of directors. Both were elected unanimously to serve three-year terms at the Council’s quarterly board meeting held April 19. Charles Treadwell, vice president and CMO, Vantage Mobility International (VMI), was also re-appointed for a second three-year term.\n“The talent, expertise and energy that Bob, Ralph and Charles bring to the table are exactly what we require to continue building Arizona’s high-tech hub,” said Steven G. Zylstra, president and CEO of the Arizona Technology Council. “We are honored to have such an esteemed board of high-caliber professionals committed to helping us advance our mission.”\nThe Council’s board of directors serve an advisory and fiduciary role by representing the interests of the state’s technology industries in the Council’s strategic planning and ongoing operations. The current board includes 40 members representing a diverse set of organizations.\nLa Loggia, Selitto and Treadwell provide a unique perspective on the industry and possess diverse skill sets that will contribute to the continued growth of Arizona’s technology communities. Their respective biographies are:\nBob La Loggia, founder and CEO, AppointmentPlus\nLa Loggia adopts an uncommon approach to culture, leadership and executive management, as much of what drives his thinking is his passion for behavioral science and wisdom. His fascination with technology and his inclination to never take himself too seriously provide him with a unique perspective on business.\nBefore co-founding AppointmentPlus, La Loggia was involved with several other startups, and his experience within the startup community prepared him well for the challenges of getting a company off the ground. Additionally, he possesses experience working for larger companies, including Accenture and JDA Software. To this day, he is highly involved in the Arizona startup community and spends a lot of time mentoring fellow entrepreneurs. Although he’s excited to see the progress Arizona has made in becoming a world-class, nurturing environment for new and growing businesses, La Loggia’s primary focus is to build the future of AppointmentPlus.\nRalph W. Selitto Jr., shareholder, Greenberg Traurig LLP\nSelitto is a registered patent attorney with a wide range of experience in all aspects of intellectual property law. Over the course of his decades-long career, he has assisted clients in the development and management of global patent, trademark and copyright portfolios, while counseling them on the strategic commercialization and valuation of their portfolios. His work has included the preparation and prosecution of numerous U.S. and foreign patent and trademark applications, as well as drafting license agreements and infringement, validity and freedom-to-operate opinions. Selitto’s efforts in these areas have allowed him to develop broad experience in the evaluation of intellectual property, from both a legal and business perspective.\nIn addition to his broad prosecution and transactional experience, Selitto has represented clients in a number of lawsuits involving patents, trademarks and copyrights. Recently, he has defended a number of clients in lawsuits involving patent invalidity defenses that resulted in the asserted patents being subjected to administrative challenges in the form of post-grant or inter partes reviews in the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\nCharles Treadwell, vice president and chief marketing officer, Vantage Mobility International\nTreadwell recently joined Vantage Mobility International (VMI) as vice president and chief marketing officer to lead marketing for VMI and its subsidiaries. Previously, Treadwell held positions as director of social marketing and senior director of digital marketing for Symantec and Norton.\nIn Treadwell’s previous role at Cisco, he built an award-winning social media brand campaign and social media command center. His command center tracked social media programs, triaged social media conversations and generated a 281 percent ROI, with an average annual benefit of $1.6 million. In 2010, he designed, built and launched Cisco Ripple, an online community and social media API that aggregated customer social profiles and activities, and generated a total economic impact of over $17 million.\nCompanies represented on the Council’s board of directors include:\nAccountabilIT; Alerion Capital Group; Alliance Bank of Arizona; American Express; AppointmentPlus; APS, Aspect; ASU Knowledge Enterprise Development; Avnet; Ballard Spahr; Barrow Neurological Institute; BeyondTrust; CISCO; Cox Communications; EY; Greenberg Traurig LLP; Honeywell Aerospace; IBM; Indecomm Global Services; Insight Enterprises; Intel; JVP Strategic Consulting; LaneTerralever; MDSL; MSS Technologies; PADT; PayPal; Phoenix Art Museum; Phoenix Business Journal; Quarles & Brady LLP; Raytheon Missile Systems; Ryley Carlock & Applewhite; Securaplane Technologies; Solugenix; TGen; Office of Research, Discovery & Innovation at The University of Arizona; Uber Technologies; University of Advancing Technology; Vonage Business Solutions Group; and Wells Fargo Bank.\nAbout the Arizona Technology Council\nThe Arizona Technology Council is Arizona’s premier trade association for science and technology companies.
