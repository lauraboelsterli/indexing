    "text": "NEW YORK & MUMBAI, India--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- WNS (Holdings) Limited (WNS) (NYSE: WNS), a leading provider of global Business Process Management (BPM) services, today announced results for the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter and full year ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights – Fiscal 2018 Fourth Quarter:\nGAAP Financials\nRevenue of $202.7 million, up 27.2% from $159.4 million in Q4 of last year and up 7.5% from $188.6 million last quarter Profit/(Loss) of $24.5 million, compared to ($5.0) million in Q4 of last year and $26.3 million last quarter Diluted earnings/(loss) per ADS of $0.47, compared to ($0.10) in Q4 of last year and $0.51 last quarter Non-GAAP Financial Measures *\nRevenue less repair payments of $198.2 million, up 28.6% from $154.1 million in Q4 of last year and up 7.1% from $185.2 million last quarter Adjusted Net Income (ANI) of $33.0 million, compared to $24.0 million in Q4 of last year and $34.2 million last quarter Adjusted diluted earnings per ADS of $0.63, compared to $0.46 in Q4 of last year and $0.66 last quarter Other Metrics\nAdded 8 new clients in the quarter, expanded 9 existing relationships Days sales outstanding (DSO) at 30 days Global headcount of 36,540 as of March 31, 2018 Highlights – Fiscal 2018 Full Year:\nGAAP Financials\nRevenue of $758.0 million, up 25.8% from $602.5 million in fiscal 2017 Profit of $86.4 million, compared to $37.8 million in fiscal 2017 Diluted earnings per ADS of $1.63, compared to $0.71 in fiscal 2017 Non-GAAP Financial Measures *\nRevenue less repair payments of $741.0 million, up 28.1% from $578.4 million in fiscal 2017 Adjusted Net Income (ANI) of $118.4 million, compared to $92.2 million in fiscal 2017 Adjusted diluted earnings per ADS of $2.24, compared to $1.74 in fiscal 2017 Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed below to our GAAP operating results are included at the end of this release. See also “About Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nRevenue in the fourth quarter was $202.7 million, representing a 27.2% increase versus Q4 of last year and a 7.5% increase from the previous quarter. Revenue less repair payments* in the fourth quarter was $198.2 million, an increase of 28.6% year-over-year and 7.1% sequentially. Excluding exchange rate impacts, constant currency revenue less repair payments* in the fiscal fourth quarter grew 21.9% versus Q4 of last year and 4.6% sequentially. Year-over-year, fiscal Q4 revenue improvement was driven by healthy organic growth across key verticals, services, and geographies, our acquisitions of HealthHelp and Denali which closed in March 2017 and January 2017 respectively, and favorability from currency net of hedging. Sequentially, revenue growth was the result of project ramps with both new and existing clients and currency movements net of hedging.\nOperating margin in the fourth quarter was 14.5%, as compared to an operating margin loss of (2.0%) in Q4 of last year and 13.6% in the previous quarter. On a year-over-year basis, margin improvement was the result of a non-recurring $21.7 million charge for goodwill impairment relating to the AutoClaims business in Q4 of fiscal 2017, increased productivity, operating leverage on higher volumes, acquisition-related expenses incurred in Q4 of last year, and lower share-based compensation as a percentage of revenue. These benefits more than offset the impact of our annual wage increases and currency movements net of hedging. Sequentially, margins increased as a result of improved productivity, operating leverage on higher volumes, and lower share-based compensation. These benefits more than offset currency movements net of hedging and lower seat utilization.\nFourth quarter adjusted operating margin* was 20.4%, versus 18.1% in Q4 of last year and 19.9% last quarter. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted operating margin* improved due to increased productivity, operating leverage on higher volumes, and acquisition-related expenses incurred in Q4 of last year. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of our annual wage increases and currency movements net of hedging. Sequentially, adjusted operating margin* increased as a result of improved productivity and operating leverage on higher volumes. These benefits more than offset currency movements net of hedging and lower seat utilization.\nProfit in the fiscal fourth quarter was $24.5 million, as compared to ($5.0) million in Q4 of last year and $26.3 million in the previous quarter. Adjusted net income (ANI)* in Q4 was $33.0 million, up $9.0 million as compared to Q4 of last year and down $1.2 million from the previous quarter. In addition to the explanations discussed above, fiscal fourth quarter profit and adjusted net income* reduced on a sequential basis by $5.2 million as a result of the net impact of one-time provisional tax adjustments associated with the 2017 US Tax Reform bill recorded in the fiscal third quarter.\nFrom a balance sheet perspective, WNS ended Q4 with $221.3 million in cash and investments and $89.1 million of debt. In the fourth quarter, the company generated $39.8 million in cash from operations, and had $5.9 million in capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 30 days, as compared to 29 days reported in Q4 of last year and 30 days in the previous quarter.\n“In the fiscal fourth quarter, WNS continued to demonstrate the strong value we are able to deliver to our clients, growing revenue less repair payments* 29% year-over-year. For the full year, WNS generated $741.0 million in revenue less repair payments*, which represented 28% growth on a reported basis and 26% constant currency*. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, fiscal 2018 top line improved 14% on a constant currency* basis. In addition, WNS delivered 19% adjusted operating margin* for the year, and grew our adjusted diluted earnings per share* by 28% to $2.24,” said Keshav Murugesh, WNS’s Chief Executive Officer. “WNS enters fiscal 2019 with solid business momentum. The BPM industry remains stable and healthy, driven by disruption in our clients’ business environments. We will continue to invest in our differentiated capabilities including domain expertise, technology and automation, analytics, and transformational solutions. Our focus on helping clients improve their competitive positioning and delivering long-term sustainable value for all of our key stakeholders remains unchanged.”\nFiscal 2019 Guidance\nWNS is providing guidance for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019 as follows:\nRevenue less repair payments* is expected to be between $801 million and $847 million, up from $741.0 million in fiscal 2018. This assumes an average GBP to USD exchange rate of 1.40 in fiscal 2019 versus 1.33 in fiscal 2018. ANI* is expected to range between $115 million and $127 million versus $118.4 million in fiscal 2018. This assumes an average USD to INR exchange rate of 65.0 in fiscal 2019 versus 64.5 in fiscal 2018. Based on a diluted share count of 52.8 million shares, the company expects adjusted diluted earnings* per ADS to be in the range of $2.18 to $2.41 versus $2.24 in fiscal 2018. Fiscal 2019 guidance includes the impact of IFRS 9, which is applicable to WNS effective April 1, 2018. IFRS 9 requires companies to report cash flow hedging gains and losses on the revenue line, which WNS had previously reported on FX gain/loss line. WNS’ fiscal 2019 guidance includes $1.7 million in revenue relating to this change, which has been removed from the constant currency* revenue growth calculation.\n“The company has provided our initial forecast for fiscal 2019 based on current visibility levels and exchange rates,” said Sanjay Puria, WNS’s Chief Financial Officer. “Our guidance for the year reflects growth in revenue less repair payments* of 8% to 14%, or 7% to 13% on a constant currency* basis. Consistent with our guidance methodology in previous years, we enter fiscal 2019 with 90% visibility to the midpoint of the range. For the year, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $30 million.”\nConference Call\nWNS will host a conference call on April 26, 2018 at 8:00 am (Eastern) to discuss the company's quarterly results.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to our GAAP operating results are included below. A more detailed discussion of our GAAP results is contained in “Part I –Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects” in our annual report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC on June 29, 2017.\nFor financial statement reporting purposes, WNS has two reportable segments: WNS Global BPM and WNS Auto Claims BPM. Revenue less repair payments is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated as (a) revenue less (b) in the auto claims business, payments to repair centers for “fault” repair cases where WNS acts as the principal in its dealings with the third party repair centers and its clients. WNS believes that revenue less repair payments for “fault” repairs reflects more accurately the value addition of the business process management services that it directly provides to its clients. For more details, please see the discussion in “Part I – Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects – Overview” in our annual report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC on June 29, 2017.\nConstant currency revenue less repair payments is a non-GAAP financial measure. We present constant currency revenue less repair payments so that revenue less repair payments may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Constant currency revenue less repair payments is presented by recalculating prior period’s revenue less repair payments denominated in currencies other than in US dollars using the foreign exchange rate used for the latest period, without taking into account the impact of hedging gains/losses. Our non-US dollar denominated revenues include, but are not limited to, revenues denominated in pound sterling, South African rand, Australian dollar and Euro.\nWNS also presents (1) adjusted operating margin, which refers to adjusted operating profit (calculated as operating profit / (loss) excluding goodwill impairment, share-based expense and amortization of intangible assets) as a percentage of revenue less repair payments, and (2) ANI, which is calculated as profit excluding goodwill impairment, share-based expense and amortization of intangible assets and including the tax effect thereon, and other non-GAAP financial measures included in this release as supplemental measures of its performance. WNS presents these non-GAAP financial measures because it believes they assist investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that are non-recurring in nature and those it believes are not indicative of its core operating performance. In addition, it uses these non-GAAP financial measures (i) as a factor in evaluating management’s performance when determining incentive compensation and (ii) to evaluate the effectiveness of its business strategies. These non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for WNS’s financial results prepared in accordance with IFRS.\nThe company is not able to provide our forward-looking GAAP revenue, profit and earnings per ADS without unreasonable efforts for a number of reasons, including our inability to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the payments to repair centers, our future share-based compensation expense under IFRS 2 (Share Based payments), amortization of intangibles associated with future acquisitions, goodwill impairment and currency fluctuations. As a result, any attempt to provide a reconciliation of the forward-looking GAAP financial measures (revenue, profit, earnings per ADS) to our forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures (revenue less repair payments*, ANI* and Adjusted diluted earnings* per ADS respectively) would imply a degree of likelihood that we do not believe is reasonable.\nReconciliation of revenue (GAAP) to revenue less repair payments (non-GAAP) and constant currency revenue less repair payments (non-GAAP)\nThree months ended Year Ended Mar 31,\n2018\nMar 31,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2017\nMar 31,\n2018\nMar 31,\n2017\n(Amounts in millions) (Amounts in millions) Revenue (GAAP) $ 202.7 $ 159.4 $ 188.6 $ 758.0 $ 602.5 Less: Payments to repair centers 4.5 5.3 3.4 17.0 24.1 Revenue less repair payments (Non-GAAP) $ 198.2 $ 154.1 $ 185.2 $ 741.0 $ 578.4 Exchange rate impact (1.3 ) 7.4 3.2 (9.2\n)\n3.3\nConstant currency revenue less repair payments (Non-GAAP)\n$ 196.9 $ 161.5 $ 188.3 $ 731.8 $ 581.8 Reconciliation of cost of revenue (GAAP to non-GAAP)\nThree months ended Year ended Mar 31,\n2018\nMar 31,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2017\nMar 31,\n2018\nMar 31,\n2017\n(Amounts in millions) (Amounts in millions) Cost of revenue (GAAP) $ 128.4 $ 107.4 $ 124.4 $ 503.1 $ 403.3 Less: Payments to repair centers 4.5 5.3 3.4 17.0 24.1 Less: Share-based compensation expense 0.8 0.8 1.0 3.8 2.8 Adjusted cost of revenue (excluding payment to repair centers and share-based compensation expense) (Non-GAAP)\n$ 123.2 $ 101.3 $ 120.0 $ 482.4 $ 376.5 Reconciliation of gross profit (GAAP to non-GAAP)\nThree months ended Year ended Mar 31,\n2018\nMar 31,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2017\nMar 31,\n2018\nMar 31,\n2017\n(Amounts in millions) (Amounts in millions) Gross profit (GAAP) $ 74.3 $ 52.0 $ 64.1\n$254.8 $ 199.2 Add: Share-based compensation expense 0.8 0.8 1.0 3.8 2.8 Adjusted gross profit (excluding share-based compensation expense) (Non-GAAP) $ 75.1 $ 52.8 $ 65.1 $258.6 $ 202.0 Three months ended Year ended Mar 31,\n2018\nMar 31,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2017\nMar 31,\n2018\nMar 31,\n2017\nGross profit as a percentage of revenue (GAAP) 36.7 % 32.6 % 34.0 % 33.6 % 33.1 % Adjusted gross profit (excluding share-based compensation expense) as a percentage of revenue less repair payments (Non-GAAP) 37.9 % 34.3 % 35.2 % 34.9 % 34.9 % Reconciliation of selling and marketing expenses (GAAP to non-GAAP)\nThree months ended Year ended Mar 31,\n2018\nMar 31,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2017\nMar 31,\n2018\nMar 31,\n2017\n(Amounts in millions) (Amounts in millions) Selling and marketing expenses (GAAP) $ 11.8 $ 9.0 $ 10.6 $41.8 $ 32.6 Less: Share-based compensation expense 0.6 0.5 0.7 2.6 1.7 Adjusted selling and marketing expenses (excluding share-based compensation expense) (Non-GAAP)\n$ 11.3 $ 8.5 $ 9.9 $39.2 $ 30.9 Three months ended Year ended Mar 31,\n2018\nMar 31,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2017\nMar 31,\n2018\nMar 31,\n2017\nSelling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue (GAAP) 5.8 % 5.7 % 5.6 % 5.5 % 5.4 % Adjusted selling and marketing expenses (excluding share-based compensation expense) as a percentage of revenue less repair payments (Non-GAAP) 5.7 % 5.5 % 5.4 % 5.3 % 5.3 % Reconciliation of general and administrative expenses (GAAP to non-GAAP)\nThree months ended Year ended Mar 31,\n2018\nMar 31,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2017\nMar 31,\n2018\nMar 31,\n2017\n(Amounts in millions) (Amounts in millions) General and administrative expenses (GAAP) $ 30.5 $ 27.3 $ 28.3\n$ 117.6 $ 91.7 Less: Share-based compensation expense 5.8 5.2 5.6 24.2 18.5 Adjusted general and administrative expenses (excluding share-based compensation expense) (Non-GAAP)\n$ 24.8 $ 22.1 $ 22.8 $ 93.4 $ 73.2 Three months ended Year ended Mar 31,\n2018\nMar 31,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2017\nMar 31,\n2018\nMar 31,\n2017\nGeneral and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue (GAAP) 15.1 % 17.1 % 15.0\n%\n15.5\n%\n15.2\n%\nAdjusted general and administrative expenses (excluding share-based compensation expense) as a percentage of revenue less repair payments (Non-GAAP) 12.5 % 14.3 % 12.3\n%\n12.6\n%\n12.7\n%\nReconciliation of operating profit / (loss) (GAAP to non-GAAP)\nThree months ended Year ended Mar 31,\n2018\nMar 31,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2017\nMar 31,\n2018\nMar 31,\n2017\n(Amounts in millions) (Amounts in millions) Operating profit / (loss) (GAAP) $ 29.4 $ (3.3 ) $ 25.7\n$ 94.9 $ 47.2 Add: Impairment of goodwill -
