    "text": "Jose Osuna, called up to be Pittsburgh’s 26th man for a doubleheader Wednesday, was 2-for-4 with a home run and three RBIs in the Pirates’ 8-3 win over the Detroit Tigers in the second game at PNC Park.\nPittsburgh had 15 hits to break a five-game losing streak after dropping the first game 13-10. Detroit had won six of eight.\nOsuna, recalled from Triple-A Indianapolis, hit a three-run homer in the second and singled and scored in the seventh.\nPittsburgh starter Chad Kuhl (3-1) allowed three runs and six hits in six innings, with eight strikeouts and one walk. Michael Feliz pitched a scoreless inning and George Kontos pitched a scoreless eighth and Felipe Vasquez did the same in the ninth.\nDetroit starter Matthew Boyd (0-2) lasted just 3 2/3 innings, giving up four runs and seven hits, with three walks and three strikeouts. Alex Wilson finished the fourth before Daniel Norris and Buck Farmer each gave up a run and two hits in an inning apiece.\nArtie Lewicki pitched the eighth and yielded two runs and four hits.\nJosh Bell and David Freese singled for the Pirates in the second. Osuna, in his first major league at-bat of the season, launched a homer to right for a 3-0 lead.\nThe Tigers got a run in the fourth to close it to 3-1 when Jeimer Candelario led off with a triple and scored on Nicholas Castellanos’ single.\nBoyd’s bases-loaded, two-out walk to Starling Marte in the fourth put the Pirates up 4-1.\nLeonys Martin’s second homer of the night — he hit one in the first game — was a two-run shot to right in the fifth to draw the Tigers to within 4-3.\nMarte’s double in the sixth drove in Sean Rodriguez for a 5-3 Pittsburgh lead.\nOsuna singled in the seventh and raced home from first for a 6-3 lead when Elias Diaz hit a swinging bunt and Farmer threw the ball into right field.\nIn the eighth, Jordy Mercer scored from first on Freese’s double, and Freese came home on pinch-hitter Colin Moran’s single to make it 8-3.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
