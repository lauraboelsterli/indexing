Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were reporting on issues in Myanmar in an independent and impartial way. They have not violated any laws in the course of their newsgathering and were simply doing their jobs. We will continue to do all we can to secure their release.”\nDetained Reuters journalist Wa Lone is escorted by police before a court hearing in Yangon, Myanmar April 11, 2018.
