The Indian rupee is expected to open higher against the dollar as China-U.S. trade tensions continued to weigh on the outlook for the greenback. Indian government bonds are likely to rise in early trade, as the Reserve Bank of India's move to allow banks to spread provisions made for mark-to-market losses on their bond portfolios is likely to boost demand. The yield on India’s benchmark 7.17 percent bond maturing in 2028 is likely to trade in a 7.26 percent-7.33 percent band today.
