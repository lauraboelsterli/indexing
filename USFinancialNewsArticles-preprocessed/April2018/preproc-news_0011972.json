    "text": "LUSAKA (Reuters) - Zambia has withdrawn military personnel deployed in December to help clean up the capital and other cities at the height of a cholera outbreak that has killed more than 80 people in seven months, the government said on Wednesday.\nFILE PHOTO: Zambian President Edgar Lungu at a meeting in Durban, South Africa May 4, 2017. REUTERS/Rogan Ward/File Photo President Edgar Lungu directed the military to help fight the spread of cholera under emergency measures to contain the waterborne disease, including the closure of markets.\nHome Affairs Minister Stephen Kampyongo told a briefing on Wednesday that the joint operations of the defense and security personnel had helped restore order and Lungu had ordered them to return to barracks at midnight on Tuesday.\n“They accomplished their mission. The commander-in-chief has since directed the defense forces to return to their regular duties,” Kampyongo said, referring to Lungu.\nPolice will continue with patrols to ensure that vendors did not return to the streets, he said.\nZambia in January relaxed rules imposed to curb the spread of cholera, allowing schools and markets to reopen as the number of new cases being reported had halved.\nCholera is spread by ingesting faecal matter and causes acute watery diarrhea. It can be treated with oral rehydration solution but the disease spreads rapidly and can kill within hours if not treated.\nReporting by Chris Mfula; Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ",
