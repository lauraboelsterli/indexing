The increase was mainly driven by an increase in total student enrollments, which increased by 95.7% to approximately 2,615,760 from approximately 1,336,600 in the same period of the prior year. The increase in total student enrollments was driven primarily by the growth of enrollments in the small class offerings and online courses.\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, operating costs and expenses were US$437.4 million, a 60.3% increase from US$272.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017.

We also operate www.jzb.com , a leading online education platform in China. Our ADSs trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"TAL\".\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn evaluating its business, TAL considers and uses the following measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as supplemental metrics to review and assess its operating performance: non-GAAP operating costs and expenses, non-GAAP cost of revenues, non-GAAP selling and marketing expenses, non-GAAP general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income attributable to TAL, non-GAAP basic and non-GAAP diluted net income per ADS. To present each of these non-GAAP measures, the Company excludes share-based compensation expenses. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned \"Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures\" set forth at the end of this release.\nTAL believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance and liquidity by excluding share-based expenses that may not be indicative of its operating performance from a cash perspective. TAL believes that both management and investors benefit from these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to TAL's historical performance and liquidity. TAL computes its non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and from period to period. TAL believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. A limitation of using non-GAAP measures is that these non-GAAP measures exclude share-based compensation charges that have been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in the Company's business. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure. The accompanying tables have more details on the reconciliations between GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures.\nFor further information, please
