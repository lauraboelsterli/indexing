    "text": "President Donald Trump's top economic advisor, Larry Kudlow , tried to tamp down reports of any potential confusion within the administration over the next set of Russia sanctions.\nHis comments came after U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said over the weekend that new U.S. sanctions would be forthcoming, only to have President Donald Trump delay further action on Monday, according to a senior administration official.\nYet despite denying that there was no confusion, he added that Haley \"might have gotten confused.\"\nKudlow said that the United States had imposed a set of sanctions on Russia and was considering other measures for the future.\n\"I think the issue here is we have a set of sanctions and additional sanctions are under consideration but have not been determined,\" Kudlow told a briefing at Mar-a-Lago, where Trump is due to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe .",
