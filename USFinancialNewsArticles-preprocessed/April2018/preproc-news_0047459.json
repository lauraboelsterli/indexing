    "text": "BOTHELL, Wash., April 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alder Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., (NASDAQ:ALDR), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel therapeutic antibodies for the treatment of migraine, today announced that Eric Carter, Ph.D., M.D., has been named Interim Chief Medical Officer, effective immediately. His primary responsibilities will include leading the Company through its ongoing Biologics License Application (BLA) submission process for eptinezumab, Alder’s lead investigational product candidate for migraine prevention, and facilitating other clinical and commercial advancement activities. He will report to Paul B. Cleveland, Interim Officer. Dr. Carter has served as a consultant to the Company since March 2018.\nDr. Carter served as Senior Vice President, Chief Medical Officer and Global Head of Clinical & Non-Clinical Development of Allergan Inc. from 2011 to 2015, where he led the organization through 11 domestic and international drug candidate approvals and managed an annual budget of approximately $700 million. With more than 20 years of experience as a physician and as an executive in the pharmaceutical industry, Dr. Carter has overseen the introduction of new drug candidates into clinical development and practice, managed complex processes and global teams and provided support around key commercialization activities for numerous organizations. Dr. Carter currently serves as Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board of Bioniz Therapeutics, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, and serves on the Board of Directors of Adverum Biotechnologies, a public gene therapy company focused on rare diseases. Dr. Carter received his M.D. from the University of Miami School of Medicine and his Ph.D. in Biochemistry from the University of Cambridge in Cambridge, England.\n“Our planned BLA submission for eptinezumab remains our top priority, and we are pleased to welcome Eric to the team as we advance towards commercialization,” said Paul B. Cleveland. “Eric has a proven record of success with the clinical development and approval of major drug candidates, and we are confident Alder will benefit from his expertise and leadership during this important time.”\n“I’m excited to join Alder and lead eptinezumab’s clinical development program in support of the Company’s planned BLA submission,” said Dr. Carter. “I look forward to working closely with the Alder team and the physician community as we progress eptinezumab towards approval, with an opportunity to provide a treatment option for millions of migraine sufferers debilitated by their disease.”\nAbout Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.\nAlder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to transforming the treatment paradigm for patients with migraine and other serious neurological or inflammatory conditions. Leveraging its pioneering monoclonal antibody technologies, Alder discovers and develops novel therapeutic antibodies designed to deliver highly differentiated, best-in-class clinical profiles. Alder's lead pivotal-stage product candidate, eptinezumab, is being evaluated as potentially the first-to-market migraine prevention infusion therapy. Eptinezumab is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) inhibiting calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which is believed to play a key role in mediating and initiating migraine. Alder is additionally evaluating ALD1910, a preclinical product candidate also in development as a migraine prevention therapy. ALD1910 is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide-38 (PACAP-38), another protein that is active in mediating the initiation of migraine. Clazakizumab, Alder's third program, is a monoclonal antibody candidate that inhibits interleukin-6 and is licensed to Vitaeris, Inc.
