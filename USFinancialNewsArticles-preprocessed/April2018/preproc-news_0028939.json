    "text": "Published: Apr 14, 2018 7:42 a.m. ET Share \nInitial reports suggested more than 100 U.S. and ally missiles were launched, about twice as many as last year’s response Reuters Syria’s state and pro-regime media early Saturday claimed its air defense systems had repelled the strikes by shooting down 13 incoming missiles. State media reported that life is normal in Damascus and posted photos from around the country of people at vegetable stalls and walking at a racetrack \nBy Sune Engle Rasmussen Nour Alakraa \nSyrians reacted with a mix of defiance and disappointment to early-morning missile strikes from the U.S., U.K. and France, demonstrating how divided the country has become over seven long years of civil war. \nAntiaircraft tracers lit up the skies over Damascus and explosive sounds bounced off the city’s hills, mixing with the mosques’ calls to prayer. Journalists in Damascus reported loud explosions shaking the capital for nearly an hour before falling quiet shortly before dawn. \nMark Hulbert: What U.S. and allied strikes on Syria mean for your stock-market investments \nU.S. officials said the strikes were limited to destroying President Bashar al-Assad’s chemical-weapons capabilities , a week after a suspected regime attack with chlorine and a nerve agent killed more than 40 people in Douma. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis called the Saturday strikes a “one-time shot.” \nSome Syrians said they were upset to see that the strikes were limited and weren’t likely to change the course of war. “There were more statements than missiles in the last week,” Mazer, a Syrian Facebook user commented. \nOthers feared the regime would retaliate and let Syrian civilians pay the price. “People of Idlib, be ready. The regime and the Russians will respond here in Idlib,” Mohammad al-Salloum, an antiregime activist in the northern city, said on Facebook.",
