Toronto, the country’s largest city, recorded a 13.6 percent decrease. \nThe Ontario government implemented a number of measures last year to rein in rampant price increases in Toronto and the surrounding areas. Overall, the value of residential permits issued in Canada dipped by 0.3 percent. \nThe smaller nonresidential sector posted a 6.6 percent drop as weaker construction intentions for commercial and institutional buildings outweighed an increase in permits issued for industrial structures. \nThe institutional component fell by 9.7 percent on lower demand for educational structures in the Quebec city of Montreal.
