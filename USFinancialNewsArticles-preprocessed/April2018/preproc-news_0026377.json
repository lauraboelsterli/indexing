    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s biggest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover ( TAMO.NS ) said it will cut 1,000 jobs and reduce production at two of its English factories as demand for diesel cars slumps in the face of higher taxes and a regulatory crackdown.\nFILE PHOTO: A worker inspects a Land Rover Discovery on the production line at their factory in Solihull, central England, February 28, 2012. REUTERS/Darren Staples/File Photo The company, which builds nearly one in three of Britain’s 1.7 million cars, will lay off some of its agency workers at its central English Solihull site and move just over 360 people to the location from its nearby Castle Bromwich plant.\nFILE PHOTO: A Land Rover is driven into the Jaguar Land Rover plant in Solihull, central England, January 14, 2009. REUTERS/Darren Staples/File Photo “We are not renewing the contracts of 1,000 agency workers at Solihull,” a spokesman told Reuters.\nJaguar sales are down 26 percent so far this year whilst Land Rover demand dropped 20 percent in its home market as buyers shun diesel.\nAbout 90 percent of Jaguar Land Rover’s (JLR) sales in Britain are diesel models, which compares with around 45 percent globally.\nReporting by Costas Pitas; editing by Michael Holden\n ",
