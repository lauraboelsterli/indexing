(“Albertsons”) Merger Expired on March 28, 2018 Sale of Stores to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (“WBA”) Completed on March 27, 2018\nCAMP HILL, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Rite Aid Corporation (NYSE:RAD) today reported operating results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 3, 2018.\nFor the fourth quarter, the company reported net loss from continuing operations of $483.7 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, Adjusted net loss from continuing operations of $10.3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $157.4 million, or 2.9 percent of revenues and pro-forma Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $173.2 million.\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 the company reported net income of $767.1 million, or $0.73 per diluted share. For the full year, the company reported net income of $943.5 million, or $0.90 per diluted share. Net income for the fourth quarter and the full year of fiscal 2018 includes an after-tax gain of approximately $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, relating to the 1,554 and 1,651 stores and related assets sold to WBA. As of March 27, 2018, Rite Aid has completed the sale of all 1,932 stores and related assets to WBA. The transfer of the three distribution centers and related inventory is expected to begin after September 1, 2018. As a result of the proceeds received from the store sales, Rite Aid’s debt related to continuing operations, net of cash, was $2.9 billion as of March 3, 2018.\n“During the fourth quarter, we made significant progress in a number of areas: our Retail Pharmacy Segment delivered strong results with an increase in Adjusted EBITDA over the prior year; our Pharmacy Services Segment is off to a strong start in the new commercial selling season; shortly after the quarter ended, we completed the asset sale of 1,932 stores to WBA; and we entered into a definitive merger agreement with Albertsons Companies to transform Rite Aid into a truly differentiated leader in food, health and wellness,” said Rite Aid Chairman and CEO John Standley.\nRite Aid President and Chief Operating Officer Kermit Crawford added: “We are pleased that we’ve been able to drive improved operational performance through a stabilization of reimbursement rates, improvements in drug purchasing costs and a record number of immunizations which helped us deliver a higher pharmacy margin for the quarter. These areas of our business will continue to be key priorities as we begin our new fiscal year and work together to continue building momentum.”\nFourth Quarter Summary\nRevenues from continuing operations for the quarter were $5.4 billion compared to revenues from continuing operations of $5.9 billion in the prior year’s fourth quarter, a decrease of $509.1 million or 8.6 percent. Retail Pharmacy Segment revenues were $4.0 billion and decreased 10.1 percent compared to the prior year period primarily as a result of the extra week in the prior year’s fourth quarter and a decline in same store sales. Revenues in the Pharmacy Services Segment were $1.4 billion, a decrease of 4.3 percent compared to the prior year period, which was due to a decline in commercial business and changes in its composition of Medicare Part D membership.\nSame store sales from Retail Pharmacy continuing operations for the quarter decreased 1.7 percent over the prior year, consisting of a 2.3 percent decrease in pharmacy sales and a 0.6 percent decrease in front-end sales. Pharmacy sales included an approximate 138 basis point negative impact from new generic introductions. The number of prescriptions filled in same stores, adjusted to 30-day equivalents, decreased 1.8 percent over the prior year period due in part to exclusion from certain pharmacy networks that Rite Aid participated in the prior year. Prescription sales from continuing operations accounted for 64.9 percent of total drugstore sales.\nNet loss from continuing operations was $483.7 million or $0.46 per diluted share compared to last year’s fourth quarter net loss from continuing operations of $25.1 million or $0.02 per diluted share. The decline in operating results was due primarily to $325 million of income tax expense relating to the revaluation of the company’s deferred tax assets as a result of the 2017 Tax Act and a charge of $191 million, net of tax, for the impairment of goodwill related to our Pharmacy Services Segment. The effect of the goodwill impairment charge is to adjust the book value of our Pharmacy Services Segment to $2.1 billion, which was our basis in the segment at the date of acquisition. Also impacting results was a decline in Adjusted EBITDA, higher WBA deal related costs, and higher lease termination and impairment charges, partially offset by a higher LIFO credit.\nAdjusted EBITDA from continuing operations (which is reconciled to net loss from continuing operations in the attached tables) was $157.4 million or 2.9 percent of revenues for the fourth quarter compared to $167.6 million or 2.8 percent of revenues for the same period last year. Current quarter Adjusted EBITDA includes the benefit of $8.2 million in TSA fees while prior year’s fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA includes the benefit of $10.8 million from the extra week. The decline in Adjusted EBITDA was due to a decrease of $11.3 million in the Pharmacy Services Segment, resulting primarily from the decline in revenues. Adjusted EBITDA in the Retail Pharmacy Segment was favorable to the prior year due to the stabilization of reimbursement rates and improvement in generic purchasing, offset somewhat by lower revenues. Results from continuing operations are fully burdened for corporate administration costs that support both continuing and discontinued operations. Fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 quarterly results from continuing operations do not include $15.8 million and $24.0 million of fees, respectively, that would be earned if all of the stores sold to WBA were being supported under the TSA for the entire respective period. After adjusting to reflect those fees as if they had been earned for the full period and adjusting for the extra week in fiscal 2017, Pro-forma Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 was $173.2 million and $180.8 million, respectively.\nIn the fourth quarter, the company relocated 6 stores and remodeled 38 stores, bringing the total number of wellness stores chainwide to 1,805. During the fourth quarter, the company sold 1,554 stores to WBA and closed 19 stores, resulting in a total store count of 2,831 at the end of the fourth quarter. Wellness store count and total store count related to continuing operations was 1,651 and 2,550, respectively.\nFull Year Results\nFor the fiscal year ended March 3, 2018, revenues from continuing operations were $21.5 billion compared to revenues of $22.9 billion in the prior year, a decrease of $1.4 billion or 6.1 percent. Retail Pharmacy Segment revenues were $15.8 billion and decreased 5.6 percent compared to the prior year period primarily as a result of the extra week in the prior year and a decline in same store sales. Revenues in the Pharmacy Services Segment were $5.9 billion, a decrease of 7.8 percent compared to the prior year, which was due a decline in commercial business and to the change in the composition of Medicare Part D membership.\nSame store sales from continuing operations for the year decreased 2.9 percent, consisting of a 3.9 percent decrease in pharmacy sales and a 0.8 percent decrease in front end sales. Pharmacy sales included an approximate 187 basis point negative impact from new generic introductions. The number of prescriptions filled in same stores, adjusted to 30-day equivalents, decreased 1.8 percent over the prior year due in part to our exclusion from certain pharmacy networks that Rite Aid participated in the prior year. Prescription sales from continuing operations accounted for 65.9 percent of total drugstore sales.\nNet loss from continuing operations for fiscal 2018 was $349.5 million or $0.33 per diluted share compared to last year’s net income from continuing operations of $4.1 million or $0.00 per diluted share. The decline in operating results was due primarily to higher income tax expense relating to the revaluation of the company’s deferred tax assets as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, a goodwill impairment charge in the current year, a decline in Adjusted EBITDA, higher lease termination and impairment charges, and higher WBA deal related costs, partially offset by a $325.0 million merger termination fee from WBA and a higher LIFO credit. Adjusted net loss from continuing operations for fiscal 2018 was $20.2 million or $0.02 per diluted share compared to last year’s Adjusted net income of $84.5 million or $0.08 per diluted share, driven primarily by a decline in Adjusted EBITDA.\nAdjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $559.9 million or 2.6 percent of revenues for the year compared to $740.1 million or 3.2 percent of revenues for last year. The decline in Adjusted EBITDA is due to a decrease of $163.5 million in the Retail Pharmacy Segment and $16.7 million in the Pharmacy Services Segment. The decrease in the Retail Pharmacy Segment EBITDA was primarily driven by a decline in pharmacy sales and gross profit. These declines were due to a continued reductions in reimbursement rates which the company was unable to fully offset with generic purchasing efficiencies, as well as lower script counts. The decrease in the Pharmacy Services Segment EBITDA was primarily driven by the decline in revenues. Fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 annual results from continuing operations do not include $87.6 million and $96.0 million of fees, respectively, that would be earned if all of the stores sold to WBA were being supported under the TSA. After adjusting to reflect those fees as if they had been earned for the full period and for the extra week in fiscal 2017, Pro-forma Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 was $647.5 million and $825.3 million, respectively.\nFor the year, the company relocated 20 stores, remodeled 179 stores, expanded 3 stores, opened 3 stores, sold 1,651 stores to WBA, and closed 57 stores.\nOutlook for Fiscal 2019\nRite Aid is confirming its fiscal 2019 outlook for Adjusted EBITDA and net loss and providing fiscal 2019 outlook for revenues, same store sales, capital expenditures and Adjusted net income. The company’s outlook for fiscal 2019 is based on the anticipated benefits from generic drug purchasing efficiencies, a reimbursement rate environment that is somewhat more stable than fiscal 2018, TSA fees under the agreement with WBA, and other initiatives to grow sales and drive operational efficiencies. The outlook provided herein, does not reflect the impact of the pending transaction with Albertsons.\nRite Aid said it expects sales to be between $21.7 billion and $22.1 billion in fiscal 2019 with same store sales expected to range from an increase of 0.0 percent to an increase of 1.0 percent over fiscal 2018.\nAdjusted EBITDA (which is reconciled to net loss in the attached table) is expected to be between $615.0 million and $675.0 million.\nNet loss is expected to be between $40.0 million and $95.0 million.\nAdjusted net income per diluted share is expected to be between $0.02 and $0.06.\nCapital expenditures are expected to be approximately $250 million.\nRite Aid is one of the nation’s leading drugstore chains with 2,548 stores in 19 states.

No offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe company separately reports financial results on the basis of Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted Net Income (Loss) per Diluted Share, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro-Forma Adjusted EBITDA which are non-GAAP financial measures. See the attached tables for a reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted Net Income (Loss) per Diluted Share, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro-Forma Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), and net income (loss) per diluted share, which are the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) per Diluted Share exclude amortization of EnvisionRx intangible assets, merger and acquisition-related costs, loss on debt retirements, LIFO adjustments, goodwill impairment and the Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. termination fee. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) excluding the impact of income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, LIFO adjustments, charges or credits for facility closing and impairment, goodwill impairment, inventory write-downs related to store closings, debt retirements, the Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. termination fee, and other items (including stock-based compensation expense, merger and acquisition-related costs, severance and costs related to distribution center closures, gain or loss on sale of assets and revenue deferrals related to our customer loyalty program).\nThe company's management team routinely evaluates how it measures the company's financial performance. In connection with such review, the company determined that it would be beneficial to investors to reflect what the company's financial results would have been had it received all of the fees that it would have earned pursuant to the TSA Agreement with WBA for the relevant period. As a result, the company hereby introduces the non-GAAP financial measure Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA which is defined as Adjusted EBITDA plus the fees that would have been earned under the TSA, and in order to improve comparability, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts results so that periods contain the same number of weeks.\nRITE AID CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (Dollars in thousands) (unaudited) March 3, 2018 March 4, 2017 ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 447,334 $ 245,410 Accounts receivable, net 1,869,100 1,771,126 Inventories, net of LIFO reserve of $581,090 and $607,326 1,799,539 1,789,541 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 181,181 211,541 Current assets held for sale 438,137 1,047,670 Total current assets 4,735,291 5,065,288 Property, plant and equipment, net 1,431,246 1,526,462 Goodwill 1,421,120 1,682,847 Other intangibles, net 590,443 715,406 Deferred tax assets 594,019 1,505,564 Other assets 217,208 215,917 Noncurrent assets held for sale -
