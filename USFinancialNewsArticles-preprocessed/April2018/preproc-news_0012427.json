These forward-looking statements are made as of the date they were first issued and were based on the current expectations, beliefs and assumptions of LogMeIn’s management concerning future developments and business conditions. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “intend,” “foresee,” “should,” “would,” “could,” “may,” “estimate,” “outlook” and similar expressions, including the negative thereof. The absence of these words, however, does not mean that the statements are not forward looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond LogMeIn's control. LogMeIn’s actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including but not limited to: (1) failure to realize the growth and other benefits anticipated as a result of the transaction or that such benefits may take longer to realize than expected, (2) LogMeIn’s ability to successfully manage and integrate Jive and its business, (3) risks related to unanticipated costs of integrating Jive, (4) LogMeIn’s ability to retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with key business partners and customers, (5) adverse trends in economic conditions generally or in the industries in which LogMeIn operates, (6) adverse changes to, or interruptions in, relationships with third parties unrelated to the merger, (7) LogMeIn’s ability to compete effectively and successfully and to add new products and services, (8) the ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers, (9) unanticipated changes relating to competitive factors in LogMeIn’s industries, and (10) any unanticipated interruptions to LogMeIn’s technology systems. Discussions of additional risks and uncertainties are contained in LMI’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). LogMeIn is under no obligation, and expressly disclaims any obligation, to update, alter, or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
