Then, on March 1, 2018, the Company revealed dismal financial results for 2018Q3 and the departure of its Chief Financial Officer.\nOn this news, the price of Patterson's shares plummeted $7.48 per share, or 23% in one day.\nAbout ClaimsFiler\nClaimsFiler has a single mission: to serve as the information source to help retail investors recover their share of billions of dollars from securities class action settlements.
