FILE PHOTO: A sign hangs above the door of a Carpetright store in Derby, Britain January 19, 2018. REUTERS/Darren Staples/File Photo\nEarlier this month the floor coverings retailer said it would seek creditor approval for a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA).\nThe plan involves the closure of 92 stores and rent reductions at 113 others. Up to 300 jobs could go.\nAt Thursday’s meeting of creditors, the CVA was approved by a majority of more than 75 percent in value of the unsecured creditors present, the company said. The CVA meeting for shareholders will be held on April 30.\nShares in Carpetright have lost over 80 percent of their value over the last year following a series of profit warnings.
