    "text": "April 28, 2018 / 7:53 PM / Updated an hour ago Madrid labour to win over Leganes without Ronaldo, Ramos Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nMADRID (Reuters) - Real Madrid beat Leganes 2-1 in La Liga on Saturday after coach Zinedine Zidane heavily rotated his side in preparation for Tuesday’s Champions League semi-final second leg against Bayern Munich, including leaving out top-scorer Cristiano Ronaldo. Soccer Football - La Liga Santander - Real Madrid vs Leganes - Santiago Bernabeu, Madrid, Spain - April 28, 2018 Real Madrid's Marco Asensio in action with Leganes' Diego Rico REUTERS/Javier Barbancho\nWales forward Gareth Bale produced an acrobatic finish from close range on the volley to put Madrid ahead against their neighbours in the eighth minute of the game, narrowly beating the offside trap despite protests from the visiting players.\nBorja Mayoral doubled their lead right at the end of the first half by stabbing in from a metre out. Again Leganes appealed for offside but the goal was eventually allowed to stand after the referee consulted with his assistant.\nLeganes were unfortunate to go two goals down at the interval after coming to close to scoring on three occasions, including Watford loanee Nordin Amrabat striking the crossbar.\nThey eventually pulled a goal back in the 66th minute when Darko Brasanac knocked a cutback from Amrabat into an empty net.\nLeganes forward Gabriel was sent off after the final whistle for reacting furiously to the referee for ending the game just as he was shaping to shoot at goal from outside the area.\nReal are third in the league on 71 points, 12 behind runaway leaders Barcelona and one behind second-placed Atletico Madrid.\nAtletico visit Alaves on Sunday while Barca play at Deportivo La Coruna, where a point will see the Catalans become Liga champions for a 25th time.\nZidane excluded Ronaldo, captain Sergio Ramos and Raphael Varane from the squad and left Luka Modric, goalkeeper Keylor Navas and influential left back Marcelo on the bench.\nHe later brought on midfielder Toni Kroos and winger Marco Asensio, who scored the winning goal in the 2-1 victory at Bayern in Wednesday’s first leg.
