    "text": "Republican Rep. Dennis Ross of Florida says he will not seek re-election to a fifth term representing what is considered a strong Republican district.\nThe announcement from Ross came as House Speaker Paul Ryan said he will not seek re-election. It continues a spate of retirements from GOP lawmakers going into the mid-term elections.\nRoss says he looks forward to returning to practice law and pursuing opportunities that encourage youth and young adults to engage in government.\nRep. Steve Stivers , the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, says he's confident Republicans will retain the seat, \"and we will do what it takes to make that happen.\"",
