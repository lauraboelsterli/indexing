The opportunity to lead the company through its transformation appealed to Wetekamp, according to Teri McEvily, Riskonnect’s chief financial officer and interim CEO.\n“Integrated risk management is becoming increasingly important for organizations looking to protect their reputations and bottom lines,” Wetekamp said. “The talented team at Riskonnect understands this new reality and is taking bold moves to deliver greater customer success and move the business forward.”\nWetekamp’s hiring comes on the heels of a strong first quarter for Riskonnect, including being named a Leader in The Forrester Wave TM : Governance, Risk, and Compliance Platforms, Q1 2018 and a finalist in the Atlanta Business Chronicle’s 2018 Pacesetter Awards.\nAbout Riskonnect\nRiskonnect, a Thoma Bravo portfolio company, is the trusted, preferred source of Integrated Risk Management technology, offering a growing suite of solutions on a world-class cloud-computing model that enables organizations to anticipate and manage strategic and operational risks across the enterprise.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180410005039/en/\nArketi Group\nJacqueline Parker, 404-929-0091, x220\nCell: 678-576-5888\njparker@arketi.com\nSource: Riskonnect",
