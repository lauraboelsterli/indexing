    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Friday hailed what he called a step toward denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, but said it was just one step and that the United States would keep up its “pressure campaign” on North Korea.\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. Vice President Mike Pence participates in the opening session of the Americas Summit in Lima, Peru April 14, 2018. REUTERS/Andres Stapff “Any talks, promises, and assurances from North Korea will be met with reservation, vigilance, and verification,” Pence said in a statement. “Planning for the United States and North Korea Summit continues, but as we’ve said before -– the pressure campaign will continue unabated.”\nReporting by Tim Ahmann; Editing by David Alexander\n ",
