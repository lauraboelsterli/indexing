LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) • The SGX Nifty nearest-month futures were trading at 10,661.00, up 0.4 percent from its previous close. • The Indian rupee is likely to open lower against the dollar amid expectations of month-end corporate demand for the U.S. currency. • Indian government bonds will likely open higher, tracking easing U.S. Treasury yields even as investors are expected to stay cautious ahead of a long weekend.Yield on the benchmark 7.17 percent 2028 bond is likely to trade in a 7.73 percent- 7.79 percent band today. GLOBAL MARKETS • U.S. stocks advanced on Thursday with each of Wall Street's major indexes ending the session up 1 percent or higher, boosted by solid earnings results and a rebound in technology stocks as U.S. bond yields pulled back. • Asian shares edged higher, after U.S. equities were buoyed by solid quarterly earnings and a rebound in technology stocks, while the euro languished near three-month lows after the European Central Bank kept interest rates unchanged. • The dollar held near a 3-1/2-month high against a basket of currencies as higher U.S. yields have prompted unwinding of big short positions in the currency while the euro was hampered by a dovish tone from the European Central Bank. • U.S. Treasury yields fell on Thursday, with the 10-year yield dipping below 3 percent as buyers emerged following a week-long selloff spurred by concerns about rising inflation and growing borrowing by the U.S. government. • Oil prices edged lower, but Brent largely held gains from the previous session amid concerns that Iran may face renewed sanctions, choking off supply. • Gold prices languished near five-week lows, set for a weekly decline of more than 1 percent on a stronger dollar, higher U.S. Treasury yields and easing geopolitical concerns.
