    "text": "April 5, 2018 / 6:35 AM / a minute ago Fidessa confirms SS&C and Ion counterbids in takeover battle Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - British software firm Fidessa Group plc ( FDSA.L ) on Thursday said that Ion Investment Group Limited and SS&C Technologies Holdings ( SSNC.O ), have separately submitted offers to buy Fidessa, in response to media reports naming the bidders. \nFidessa on Tuesday postponed an imminent shareholder vote on whether to back a 1.4 billion pound ($2 billion) takeover bid from Switzerland’s Temenos ( TEMN.S ), saying it might receive two more offers. \nIon’s bid would see Fidessa shareholders receive in aggregate 38.30 pounds for each Fidessa share, a five percent premium to the Temenos offer, Fidessa said in a filing on Tuesday that did not identify Ion.
