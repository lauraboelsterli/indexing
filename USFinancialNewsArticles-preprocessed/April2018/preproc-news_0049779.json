    "text": "Appointments Position Lean Construction Firm for Continued Growth\nDALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Skiles Group , a DFW-based construction firm recognized for its healthcare, education, and faith-based facility expertise and its process innovation, announces two executive team changes: Keyan Zandy , previously Director of Operations, has been appointed Chief Operating Officer, and Michael Blakemore has joined the firm as Senior Vice President.\n“Since starting a Lean Construction trajectory five years ago, we have tripled our firm’s project volume,” says Clay Harrison, CEO for Skiles Group. “As COO, Keyan will continue this trend by developing, implementing, and refining processes; vetting and incorporating game-changing technology solutions; and increasing our visibility both locally and nationally to ensure that we are the preferred contractor in every market we serve.”\nHarrison continues, “Concurrently adding Michael as SVP with Skiles Group is a coup and perfectly timed to fuel our growth. He will spearhead market and sector expansion and champion our proven Lean Construction approach. Keyan and Michael are both strategic, future-oriented thinkers who share a vision, sense of urgency, and client service philosophy.”\nZandy Embodies Lean Mindset, Seeks Innovation\nA recognized Lean expert with 15 years of experience in the construction industry, Zandy joined Skiles Group in 2014. He embraces disruptive, continuous process improvement as he collaborates with employees, clients, and trade partners. With Skiles Group, he led the introduction and use of Lean principles, pull planning, and target value design.\n“Our industry is changing, and playing a part in shaping that change excites me,” Zandy says. “Skiles Group is special. This isn’t your typical construction firm. Our culture attracts and nurtures curious thinkers . We aren’t satisfied with following; we want to be at the front, asking ‘why’ and ‘what if.’ This is what drives me. Being afforded this leadership opportunity with a team of people that have that kind of mentality is exactly where I want to be.”\nZandy holds a bachelor’s degree from the College of Architecture at Texas A&M University. He is past Chairman for the Lean Construction Institute’s Dallas/Fort Worth Community of Practice and presents nationally on Lean methodologies.\nBlakemore Brings Accountability, Shares Vision\nWith more than 24 years of experience in the construction industry, Blakemore will focus on expanding the firm’s footprint across market sectors, geographies, and projects . A Lean and healthcare industry expert as well, his approach aligns with Skiles Group’s operating philosophy and strategic goals.\n“Skiles Group builds relationships on trust and integrity. The vision of the leadership team and the caliber of people in the organization are truly unrivaled,” Blakemore says. “Skiles Group treats people right; they’re honest; and they’ve been a respected part of the community for more than 40 years. Being able to influence the firm’s growth, and personally grow with the organization, is a tremendous opportunity.”\nBlakemore comes to Skiles Group from JE Dunn, where he served as co-business unit leader and vice president, focused on client development and project operations. He holds dual bachelor’s degrees in construction science and environmental design/architecture from Texas A&M University.\nAbout Skiles Group\nFounded in 1972, DFW-based Skiles Group provides general contracting, construction management, integrated project delivery, and design/build services throughout the U.S. Specializing in construction for award-winning healthcare facilities, the firm’s portfolio includes commercial, public and private schools, performing arts, faith-based, and recreational facilities.
