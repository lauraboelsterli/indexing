But the lack of accountability has left wounds unhealed.

REUTERS/Andrea Comas/File Photo \nMany families of the soldiers and civilians killed during the conflict - as many as 500,000 by some estimates - want to exhume the bodies of loved ones from the hundreds of mass graves scattered over Spain to bury again in solemn ceremonies. \nValle de los Caidos, marked by a 152 meter-high cross and carved out of rock on a mountainside an hour’s drive northwest of Madrid, has been criticized as the only remaining monument to a fascist leader in Europe. \nConvict workers from the losing Republican side were employed in its construction. Slideshow (6 Images) \nA church on the site houses the tombs of Franco and Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera, the founder of Spain’s fascist political party the Falange in 1934. Franco died of natural causes in 1975 after ruling Spain for 36 years. \nConstruction experts on Monday assessed the possibility of extracting the remains of the Lapena brothers - who were shot by Franco’s forces in the early days of the war - and two Nationalist fighters, Pedro Gil and Juan Gonzalez. \nThe dead men are just four of the thousands of soldiers from both sides of the Civil War buried at the site. Many were exhumed from mass graves around Spain in the 1950s and taken to the Valle de los Caidos without families’ knowledge or consent. \nRelatives of the dead men gathered at the gates of the monument on Monday, holding old black-and-white photographs of their grandfathers. \n“This is not about left-wing versus right-wing,” said Eduardo Ranz, the lawyer representing the families. “There are representatives of both the Republican and the Nationalist sides here,” he added. \nA Spanish court ordered work to exhume the Lapena brothers’ remains in a landmark case two years ago but the process was halted after the Benedictine abbot who runs the church on the site appealed the order. \nThe abbot said he was concerned the remains of other bodies would be disturbed and the church could be damaged during the exhumation. However, he relented last month and lifted his appeal, allowing the work to resume. \n“This is a very important day: not just for us but for all families in the same position,” said Maria Purificacion Lapena, granddaughter of one of the Lapena brothers. “I would like to see this place become a center for finding out the truth about the past,” she added.
