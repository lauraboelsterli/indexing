    "text": "April 10, 2018 / 3:13 PM / Updated 3 minutes ago UPDATE 1-Rio Tinto reviewing Rusal ties, mum on Queensland venture Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Adds quote, other details, sustainability initiative) \nApril 10 (Reuters) - Rio Tinto Plc is reviewing its trading relationships with Russian aluminum producer United Company Rusal to make sure it complies with U.S. sanctions, its aluminum boss said on Tuesday, but added it was premature to speculate on the future of an Australian venture of which Rusal is part owner. \nRusal owns 20 percent of Rio’s Queensland Alumina operation, of which Rio owns the remaining 80 percent. \n“We are reviewing in detail all our trading relationships with Rusal and other counterparties and we will obviously do what we have to do to ensure that we comply with applicable sanctions,” Alf Barrios, Rio Tinto Aluminium chief executive Alf said in an interview. \nHe said the global miner had had calls from customers wanting to ensure they could get a secure supply of aluminum in future. Rio would continue to work with them to support them, he said. \nRio Tinto will be among the biggest winners from U.S. sanctions on Rusal as the penalties further shake up the global metals trade and boost costs for U.S. consumers, industry sources say. \nRio on Tuesday also said it was the first company in the world to receive certification under the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative, an international standard certifying that aluminum has been responsibly and sustainably produced.
