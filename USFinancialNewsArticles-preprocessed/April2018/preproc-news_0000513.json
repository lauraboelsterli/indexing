Soccer Football - Championship - Wolverhampton Wanderers vs Hull City - Molineux Stadium, Wolverhampton, Britain - April 3, 2018 Wolverhampton Wanderers' Oskar Buur celebrates scoring their second goal Action Images/John Sibley \nThird-placed Fulham moved within five points of Cardiff City with a 2-0 home win over mid-table Leeds United, while Aston Villa, who are fourth, beat strugglers Reading 3-0. \nWolves are on 86 points from 40 games, ahead of Cardiff, who drew 1-1 at Sheffield United on Monday and have 80 points with a game in hand. Fulham have 75 points with Villa on 73, followed by Derby County with 65 and Middlesbrough on 63. Soccer Football - Championship - Wolverhampton Wanderers vs Hull City - Molineux Stadium, Wolverhampton, Britain - April 3, 2018 Wolverhampton Wanderers' Ryan Bennett scores an own goal for Hull's second Action Images/John Sibley \nThe top two earn automatic promotion to the Premier League with the next four clubs going into the playoffs. Wolves visit Cardiff in a top-of-the-table clash on Friday. Slideshow (6 Images) \nWolves debutant Oskar Buur salvaged a point for the league leaders with a header in the 83rd minute after Hull had moved 2-1 ahead through a Ryan Bennett own goal five minutes earlier. \nDiogo Jota had earlier put Wolves ahead with a penalty after 18 minutes having been fouled by Michael Hector, but struggling Hull’s David Meyler equalised from the spot in the 37th. \nWolves need eight points from their remaining six games to secure promotion back to the top flight. \nFulham kept up the pressure on Cardiff as they beat Leeds thanks to Kevin McDonald’s deflected opener in the 33rd minute and Aleksandar Mitrovic’s goal on the counter just past the hour. \nVilla kept pace with three second-half goals to beat 10-man Reading after the visitors had Dave Edwards sent off on the half-hour for a second booking following two poor challenges. \nBirkir Bjarnason curled in the opener from the edge of the area after the break before Conor Hourihane headed in a Robert Snodgrass cross after 63 minutes. Scott Hogan added the third after visitng goalkeeper Vito Mannone tried to dribble the ball. Writing by Ken Ferris; Editing by Peter Rutherford",
