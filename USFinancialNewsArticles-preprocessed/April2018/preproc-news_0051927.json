    "text": "NEW YORK, April 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DocuSign, Inc. (Nasdaq:DOCU), which offers the leading e-signature solution as part of its broader platform for automating the agreement process, visited the Nasdaq MarketSite in Times Square today to mark its initial public offering (IPO) on The Nasdaq Stock Market.\nDocuSign, Inc., the global e-signature and digital agreements platform leader, visits the Nasdaq MarketSite in Times Square to mark its initial public offering (IPO).\nFounded in 2003, DocuSign’s value is clear: the traditional, paper-based agreement process is manual, slow and error-prone. DocuSign eliminates the paper and automates the process, allowing companies to measure turnaround time in minutes rather than days, substantially reduce costs, and largely eliminate errors.\n“We began our journey 15 years ago looking to simplify and streamline the complicated and cumbersome paper-based agreements process used by millions of people every single day,” said Dan Springer, CEO of DocuSign. “We now enable more than 370,000 paying customers and hundreds of millions of users to execute agreements digitally from almost anywhere in the world. So today is a truly historic milestone for us—and it’s another step on our exciting journey ahead.”\n“As organizations undergo digital transformations to meet the accelerated needs of clients and employees, DocuSign provides an innovative solution that addresses these demands by reimagining a fundamental part of doing business,” said Adena Friedman, President and CEO, Nasdaq. “We are proud to be DocuSign’s exchange partner, and we welcome them to our family of forward-thinking companies that are helping businesses navigate a digital world.”\nThe information contained above is provided for informational and educational purposes only, and nothing contained herein should be construed as investment advice, either on behalf of a particular security or an overall investment strategy.
