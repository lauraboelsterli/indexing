    "text": "DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Transcontinental Realty Investors, Inc. (NYSE: TCI), a Dallas-based real estate investment company is reporting its continued growth in both revenue and net operating income for 2017. Revenue increased to $125.2 million in 2017 as compared to $118.4 million in 2016 while net operating income increased to $20.1 million for 2017 compared to $17.6 million for 2016. Further the Company is continuing its growth strategy into the future with fourteen additional apartment projects in various stages of development. As these new projects come to completion our strategic model of focusing on our multifamily portfolio for the future growth of the Company will continue. We are on track and well positioned operationally and strategically for the opportunities ahead.\nManagement will continue its plan for growth from its operating properties and expects to reinvest in areas that will complement this growth; further management will maintain strong attention to all details of its operations including appropriate expense controls.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported net loss applicable to common shares of $16.7 million or ($1.92) per diluted earnings per share compared to a net loss applicable to common shares of $0.9 million or ($0.10) per diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2016. These amounts were impacted by gains on the sale of property of $14.7 million in 2017 as compared to $19.3 million in 2016. In addition during 2016 and 2017 a subsidiary of TCI raised $115 million through the sale of bonds which are traded on the Israeli stock exchange. In 2017 TCI recorded a non-cash foreign currency loss of $4.6 million.\nRevenues\nRental and other property revenues were $125.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This represents an increase of $6.7 million, as compared to the prior year revenues of $118.5 million. The change by segment is an increase in the apartment portfolio of $6.2 million and an increase in the commercial portfolio of approximately $0.5 million. We purchased four apartment communities during the year ended December 31, 2016, which produced rental revenue of $8.3 million and $2.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for a net increase of $6.3 million. In addition, we purchased one apartment property during 2017 that produced revenues of $0.8 million in rental revenues.\nExpense\nProperty operating expenses were $63.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This represents an increase of $1.2 million, as compared to the prior year operating expenses of $61.9 million. The growth in our apartment portfolio resulted in a $2.9 million increase in property operating expenses. The Company added a net 723 units during 2016 and 201 units during 2017. Property operating expenses for our commercial portfolio decreased $1.8 million. In addition, we had a decrease in property operating expenses for our land portfolio of $1.0 million.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses were $25.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This represents an increase of $1.9 million as compared to prior year depreciation of $23.7 million. The increase is primarily due to the growth in our apartment portfolio which had an increase of $1.6 million year-over-year.\nAdvisory fees were $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This represents an increase of $0.5 million compared to the prior year advisory fees of $9.5 million. Advisory fees are computed based on a gross asset fee of 0.0625% per month (0.75% per annum) of the average of the gross asset value.\nOther income (expense)\nMortgage and loan interest expense was $59.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This represents an increase of $6.8 million compared to the prior year expense of $53.1 million. The change by segment is an increase in the other portfolio of $9.7 million, an increase in the commercial portfolio of $0.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in the apartment portfolio of $3.0 million and a decrease in the land portfolio of $0.2 million. Within the other portfolio, the increase is due to incurring new mezzanine debt obligations. Within the apartment portfolio, the majority of the increase is due to the acquisition of a new property, partially offset by the refinancing of six loans during 2017 at lower rates.\nGain on sale of income-producing properties was $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The gain recorded in 2017 represents the recognition of deferred income from a property sale in a prior year. Gain on land sales was $4.9 million and $3.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nAbout Transcontinental Realty Investors, Inc.\nTranscontinental Realty Investors, Inc., a Dallas-based real estate investment company, holds a diverse portfolio of equity real estate located across the U.S., including apartments, office buildings, shopping centers, and developed and undeveloped land.
