    "text": "(Reuters) - Missouri’s attorney general called on Governor Eric Greitens, a fellow Republican, to resign on Wednesday, saying the findings of a newly released state legislative report on a sex scandal that has embroiled Greitens are grounds for impeachment.\nFILE PHOTO: Missouri Governor Eric Greitens appears in a police booking photo in St. Louis, Missouri, U.S., February 22, 2018. St. Louis Metropolitan Police Dept./Handout via REUTERS Attorney General Josh Hawley, a candidate for the U.S. Senate seat held by Democrat Claire McCaskill, said the report “contains shocking, substantial and corroborated evidence of wrongdoing” by the 44-year-old governor.\nGreitens, who is charged with criminal invasion of privacy in connection with an admitted extramarital affair in 2015 before his election, said earlier on Wednesday that he was determined to stay in office while fighting to clear his name in court.\nReporting by Kevin Murphy in Kansas City; Additional reporting and writing by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ",
