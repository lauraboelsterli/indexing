A revenue-earning day is defined as a 24-hour period during which a rig earns a dayrate after commencement of operations and excludes mobilization, demobilization and contract preparation days.\n(2)\nUtilization is calculated as the ratio of total revenue-earning days divided by the total calendar days in the period for all specified rigs in our fleet (including cold-stacked rigs). Our current fleet includes four floaters that are cold stacked.\n(3)\nOperational efficiency is calculated as the ratio of total revenue-earning days divided by the sum of total revenue-earning days plus the number of days (or portions thereof) associated with unanticipated equipment downtime.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited)\nTo supplement the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, this press release provides investors with adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that these measures provide meaningful information about the Company's performance by excluding certain charges that may not be indicative of the Company's ongoing operating results. This allows investors and others to better compare the company's financial results across previous and subsequent accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the long-term performance of the Company. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered to be a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nIn order to fully assess the financial operating results of the Company, management believes that the results of operations adjusted to exclude gains on the sale of rigs, restructuring and separation costs, the impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as the related tax effects thereof and other discrete tax items, are appropriate measures of the continuing and normal operations of the Company. However, these measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, contract drilling revenue, contract drilling expense, operating income, cash flows from operations or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\n2018\n2017\nReconciliation of As Reported Operating Income (Loss) to\nAdjusted Operating Income:\n(In thousands)\nAs reported operating income (loss)\n$ 512\n$ (6,385)\nImpairments and other charges:\nImpairment of rigs (1)\n-\n28,045\nRestructuring and separation costs (2)\n3,011\n14,146\nGain on sale of rigs (3)\n(229)\n(8,417)\nAdjusted operating income\n$ 3,294\n$ 27,389\nReconciliation of As Reported Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted Net Loss:\n(In thousands)\nAs reported net income (loss)\n$ 19,321\n$ (31,941)\nImpairments and other charges:\nImpairment of rigs (1)\n-\n28,045\nRestructuring and separation costs (2)\n3,011\n14,146\n(Gain) loss on sale of rigs (3)\n(229)\n(8,417)\nTax effect of impairments and other charges:\nImpairment of rigs (4)\n-\n(9,816)\nRestructuring and separation costs (4)\n(274)\n(1,070)\nGain on sale of rigs (4)\n146\n556\nOther discrete items (5)\n(43,320)\n1,154\nAdjusted net loss\n$ (21,345)\n$ (7,343)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\n2018\n2017\nReconciliation of As Reported Income (Loss) per Diluted\nShare to Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share:\nAs reported income (loss) per diluted share\n$ 0.14\n$ (0.23)\nImpairments and other charges:\nImpairment of rigs (1)\n-\n0.21\nRestructuring and separation costs (2)\n0.02\n0.10\nGain on sale of rigs (3)\n-\n(0.06)\nTax effect of impairments and other charges:\nImpairment of rigs (4)\n-\n(0.07)\nRestructuring and separation costs (4)\n-\n(0.01)\nGain on sale of rigs (4)\n-\n-\nOther discrete items (5)\n(0.32)\n0.01\nAdjusted loss per diluted share\n$ (0.16)\n$ (0.05)\n(1)\nRepresents the impairment loss recognized during the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the write down of our jack-up rig.\n(2)\nRepresents restructuring and separation costs recognized associated with a plan to restructure our world-wide operations, including a reduction in workforce at our corporate facilities and onshore bases, and costs associated with the termination of our Brazilian agency agreement.\n(3)\nRepresents the aggregate gain recognized during fourth quarter of 2017 related to the sale of five floaters and the gain recognized in first quarter of 2018 related to the sale of one floater.\n(4)\nRepresents the income tax effects of the aggregate restructuring and separation costs and gains on the sale of rigs recognized during fourth quarter of 2017 and first quarter of 2018 and the impairment loss recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017.
