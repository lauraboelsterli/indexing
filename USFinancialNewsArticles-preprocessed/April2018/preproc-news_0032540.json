    "text": "April 17, 2018 / 7:29 PM / Updated an hour ago GLOBAL MARKETS-U.S., Europe shares climb as dollar recovers on data Reuters Staff \n* U.S., European stocks helped by return of risk appetite \n* Goldman Sachs and Netflix result drive Wall St higher \n* China Q1 GDP up 6.8 pct, industrial output misses forecast \n* Upbeat data lifts dollar, short-dated Treasury yields \n* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh (Adds settled oil prices; recasts with dollar and Treasury; updates throughout) \nBy Hilary Russ \nNEW YORK, April 17 (Reuters) - U.S. and European shares climbed on Tuesday on corporate results and a renewed appetite for risk, while the dollar climbed off a two-week low and 2-year Treasury yields touched a decade high after economic data supported expectations of further rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. \nRobust earnings from Netflix, Goldman Sachs and healthcare companies drove gains on Wall Street and boosted optimism about what is expected to be the strongest earnings season in seven years. \nS&P 500 companies are expected to report an 18.6 percent jump in first-quarter profit on average, according to Thomson Reuters data. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 215.39 points, or 0.88 percent, to 24,788.43, the S&P 500 gained 28.35 points, or 1.06 percent, to 2,706.19, and the Nasdaq Composite added 127.17 points, or 1.78 percent, to 7,283.46. \nMSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.73 percent. \nThe euro fell slightly after rising above $1.24 to a three-week high on mixed Chinese economic data, easing fears of Syria retaliation fears and overall renewed risk sentiment. \nSterling was last trading at $1.4289, down 0.32 percent, after hitting nearly $1.438, its highest level since Britain’s vote in June 2016 to exit the European Union. \nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against six other major currencies, rose 0.11 percent, strengthened by the weaker euro and sterling and by stronger-than-expected U.S. housing starts in March and a positive reading on industrial production. \nShort-dated Treasury yields rose for a second day. The spread between 2- and 10-year Treasury bond yields hit 43.2 basis points, the lowest level since August 2007. \n“Even with the bad weather in March, the data has really strengthened, supporting the view that the Fed will most likely have to hike rates in June,” said John Herrmann, director of U.S. rates strategies at MUFG Securities in New York. \nEuropean shares advanced, with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rising 0.8 percent. Germany’s Deutsche Boerse DAX index closed 1.57 higher. \nOil prices steadied as investors took profit on last week’s rally and amid concern over the potential for supply disruptions. \nBrent crude futures settled at $71.58 per barrel, up 0.22 percent. \nU.S. crude oil futures settled up 0.45 percent at $66.52 per barrel. \nIn China, stocks in Shanghai closed near a one-year low, after a U.S. move to ban American companies from selling components to Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp hurt tech stocks. \nIn addition, data showed that March industrial output in China missed expectations and first-quarter fixed-asset investment growth slowed. However, China’s economy grew 6.8 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier. \nU.S. sanctions on major Russian producer Rusal drove aluminum prices to almost $2,500 a tonne, their highest since mid 2011, before profit-taking reversed most gains. Rusal accounts for 6 to 7 percent of global aluminum supply.
