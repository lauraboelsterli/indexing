FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Premier League - Newcastle United vs Arsenal - St James' Park, Newcastle, Britain - April 15, 2018 Newcastle United manager Rafael Benitez REUTERS/Scott Heppell \nNewcastle’s shock 2-1 win over Arsenal last weekend was their fourth successive league victory and moved the Magpies to 10th in the table on 41 points. \nThe Spanish boss, who will take charge of his 100th game for the Magpies when they travel to Everton later on Monday, said the playing staff needed investment to make sure they steer clear of relegation battles. \n“I cannot do miracles every year, so then you have to have the tools to be sure that you can do your job,” Benitez told reporters. \n“I like to win, I want to win games and I want to win trophies. I want to be capable of competing and if you want to compete in the Premier League or this market, then you have to compete in everything ... \n“I’d like to do that and at the same time, I like to improve players, coach players, follow a business plan, a realistic business plan in modern football. I have no problem with that because I did it in the past.” Reporting by Aditi Prakash in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Rutherford",
