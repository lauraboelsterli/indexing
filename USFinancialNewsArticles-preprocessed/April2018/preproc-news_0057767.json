    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - German drug and crop chemical maker Bayer AGâ€™s bid to buy seed and chemical company Monsanto Co is on track to win U.S. antitrust approval by the end of May, unless there is a last-minute complication, a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday.\nFILE PHOTO: Monsanto logo is displayed on a screen where the stock is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S. on May 9, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo The transaction, if it closes as seems likely, will create a company commanding more than a quarter of the combined world market for seeds and pesticides in the fast-consolidating farm supplies industry.\nReporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Susan Heavey\n ",
