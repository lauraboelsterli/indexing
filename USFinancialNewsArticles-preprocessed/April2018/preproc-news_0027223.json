Soccer Football - Bundesliga - Bayer Leverkusen v Eintracht Frankfurt - BayArena, Leverkusen, Germany - April 14, 2018 Bayer Leverkusen's Kevin Volland celebrates scoring a goal REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay \nThe 25-year-old forward charged through in the 71st minute to put Leverkusen 2-1 in front after Julian Brandt had fired the hosts ahead in the 20th only for Marco Fabian to draw Frankfurt level three minutes later. \nVolland, with only an outside chance of earning a place in Germany’s World Cup squad, added another six minutes later with an easy tap-in and completed his treble with an almost identical goal two minutes from time for his 14th league goal this season. \nIt was a bitter defeat for Frankfurt coach Niko Kovac the day after it was announced he will join Bayern Munich next season, as his club slipped to sixth, five points behind Leverkusen who have 51, with four games left. Slideshow (8 Images) \nThe top four clubs qualify for next season’s lucrative Champions League group stage. \nTreble-chasing Bayern Munich, who secured their sixth straight title last week, host Borussia Moenchengladbach later on Saturday. \nBut their eyes will be firmly on next week’s German Cup semi-final against Leverkusen and the looming Champions League last four clash with Real Madrid later this month. \nSchalke 04, on 52 points, and Borussia Dortmund, a point behind them in third, will battle it out for second place when they meet in the Ruhr valley derby on Sunday.
