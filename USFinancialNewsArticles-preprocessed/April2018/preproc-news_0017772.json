    "text": "April 11, 2018 / 6:42 AM / Updated 43 minutes ago UK's McCarthy & Stone sees modest growth over next 2 years Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n  Britain’s McCarthy & Stone said it expected modest growth in the next two years due to a decline in land exchanges and planning consents in the half-year, following a government proposal to set ground rents. \nThe British government proposed last July that builders be banned from selling leasehold homes in England and ground rents on flats could be cut to zero, responding to public criticism about price hikes facing leaseholders. \nThe U.K.’s biggest builder of homes for retirees said it was cautious in its response to the uncertainty resulting from the proposal and attained 22 land exchanges and 21 planning consents in the six months period to Feb. 28, down from 30 land exchanges and 34 planning consents in the prior year. \nRevenue for the period rose 1 percent to 239.6 million pounds ($340.04 million) with the average selling price climbing 15 percent. ($1 = 0.7046 pounds) (Reporting by Rahul B in Bengaluru; Editing by Sunil Nair)",
