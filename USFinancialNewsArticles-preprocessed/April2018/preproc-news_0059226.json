U.S. President Donald Trump and Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel hold a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House in Washington, U.S., April 27, 2018. REUTERS/Brian Snyder\nTrump told a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel that he hoped his upcoming meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would be productive and he was encouraged by the expressed goal of North and South Korean leaders for complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.\n“In pursuit of that goal, we will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations. Maximum pressure will continue until denuclearization occurs. I look forward to our meeting. It should be quite something,” Trump told a news conference.
