FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Premier League - Manchester City v Swansea City - Etihad Stadium, Manchester, Britain - April 22, 2018 Swansea City manager Carlos Carvalhal REUTERS/Phil Noble \nThe Welsh side, who were bottom of the table when Carvalhal was appointed in December, are four points clear of the relegation zone in 17th position and play three of their remaining four games at Liberty Stadium. \nSwansea have four wins and a draw from their last five home league matches and begin the run-in on Saturday at home to Chelsea before travelling to face Bournemouth. \nThey the host Stoke City and Southampton, the two teams directly below them, in their final two games. \n\"At the Liberty, we have a different face - this is the reality,\" Carvalhal told Swansea's website www.swanseacity.com . \n“We know where we are, we know what we have done so far and we know exactly what we can do. We will continue on our path and do what we are doing. We will be ready. \n“In three months, we have made up nine points on other teams. It’s amazing,” the Portuguese boss added. “If you asked me when I arrived, nobody would believe that we could achieve that. \n“Now we have four games to play - some clubs near us have three. We haven’t got easy games, but it is all in our hands.” Reporting by Aditi Prakash in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Rutherford",
