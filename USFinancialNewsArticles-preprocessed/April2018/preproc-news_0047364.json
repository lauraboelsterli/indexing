    "text": "LONDON, A combination of AstraZeneca immunotherapy drugs in lung cancer patients who have already received at least two previous treatments has failed to show a benefit in slowing disease progression or helping patients live longer.\nThe disappointing results from the so-called ARCTIC study, announced on Tuesday, are a fresh setback for the idea of using two immunotherapy drugs together. The Phase III ARCTIC study was testing a combination of Imfinzi and tremelimumab.\nA sub-study that was not powered for statistical significance did, however, find that Imfinzi monotherapy showed a clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of death compared to chemotherapy.
