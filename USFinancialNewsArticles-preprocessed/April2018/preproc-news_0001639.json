    "text": "0 COMMENTS Roadrunner Transportation Systems Inc. expects to be up-to-date in its financial reporting by the end of this quarter, executives said Monday, as the trucking company overhauls its operations under a new management team.\nThe Downers Grove, Ill.-based business said last year it would restate earnings from 2014 to 2016 after disclosing accounting problems in the wake of a rapid spate of acquisitions. An internal investigation later widened the scope to include reporting periods going back to 2011, and found accounting errors and material weaknesses in the company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nRoadrunner last week filed quarterly reports for the first three quarters of 2017. Revenue increased to $1.53 billion, up 3.3% compared with the same period in 2016, while the company’s operating loss narrowed to $14.1 million, from $352.5 million from the year earlier.\nThe new filings are “another important step in our journey to return to normal filing status,” Roadrunner Chief Executive Curt Stoelting said in an investor conference call Monday.\nAlso in Logistics\nTrucking Companies Are Struggling to Attract Drivers to the Big-Rig Life April 3, 2018 Teamsters, Trucker ABF Freight Reach Tentative Contract Deal March 29, 2018 ACLU Claims Maritime Union Discriminates Against Pregnant Workers March 29, 2018 FoodLogiQ Raises $19.5 Million in Round Including Tyson Ventures March 29, 2018 He said the company expects to file its full fiscal 2017 results, as well as earnings for the first quarter of 2018, in this year’s second quarter. “From that point forward, we expect to remain current in our quarterly and annual filings,” Mr. Stoelting said.\nRoadrunner’s stock, which traded at over $28 a share less than three years ago, was down 5.9%, to $2.39 per share, at the close of trading on Monday.\nLast year, Roadrunner installed a new executive management team led by Mr. Stoelting, who joined the company in 2016 as chief operating officer, and hired a new chief financial officer, Terence Rogers. The company also sold off a cold-chain logistics subsidiary, Unitrans Inc., for $95 million, and moved its corporate headquarters.\nThe company since then has been realigning its businesses to get them to work more closely together. This year, for instance, Roadrunner integrated and rebranded several of its logistics companies into a single segment called Ascent Global Logistics.\nRoadrunner is also focused on improving operations in its truckload segment, which it said has benefitted since late last year from improving freight demand and rising trucking prices.\nBut that same development has hampered its less-than-truckload division, where the company said tight capacity and rising costs for purchased transportation hurt profits during the first three quarters of 2017. Performance in that segment also suffered because the company didn’t have uniform freight-handling processes across its LTL terminal and line-haul network, executives said.\nWrite to Jennifer Smith at jennifer.smith@wsj.com",
