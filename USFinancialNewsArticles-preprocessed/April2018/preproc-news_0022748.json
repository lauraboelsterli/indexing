Cricket - Women's Cricket World Cup Final - England vs India - London, Britain - July 23, 2017 England's Anya Shrubsole celebrates after bowling India's Poonam Raut LBW Action Images via Reuters/Andrew Couldridge \nAnya Shrubsole became the first woman cricketer to feature on the cover of the “bible of cricket”, while team mates Heather Knight and Natalie Sciver also made the list. \n“Absolutely honoured by this... hopefully the first of many to come #wisdenjacket,” 26-year-old Shrubsole tweeted. \nBroadcasts of last year’s women’s World Cup were watched by a record-breaking 182 million viewers with Knight’s England beating a Mithali Raj-led India by nine runs in the July 23 final at Lord’s to claim a fourth title. \nWest Indies batsman Shai Hope, who scored a hundred in each innings of a Headingley test in August, and Essex seamer Jamie Porter, who helped the side win a first Country Championship since 1992, completed the quintet. \nIndia captain Virat Kohli was named the “Leading Cricketer in the World” for a second successive year, while Raj won the same honour in the women’s category. \nTeenage Afghan spinner Rashid Khan bagged the inaugural “Leading Twenty20 Player of the Year” honour. \nRecipients of the “Five Cricketers of the Year” award are generally only nominated once for the honour in their career.
