Rusal accounts for 6-7 percent of global aluminium supply. Oil steadied at $66.26 a barrel for U.S. crude and $71.43 a barrel for Brent, having tumbled nearly 1.8 percent overnight as concerns over the Middle East eased. In another sign of the returning risk appetite, the yen fell flat at 107 per dollar and Southern European government debt outperformed better-rated peers.\n“We have had a long enough period of extended volatility now that some of the more extended positions in risk assets have been reduced, so that is also a positive,” said Michael Metcalfe, head of global macro strategy at State Street Global Markets.\nOn sterling, which was buying just over $1.43, he added that with so much good Brexit news priced in by investors in recent weeks and rate hike bets growing, it was difficult to see how much further it could go.\nU.S. President Donald Trump’s comments on Monday about China and Russia trying to devalue their currencies continued to weigh somewhat on the dollar, with investors believing that the U.S. administration wants a weaker currency.\n“It was a warning shot at China and Russia about devaluation. China has devalued their currency in the past,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin then said during a television interview early on Tuesday. “He’s watching it.” (Additional Reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro in Tokyo Editing by Catherine Evans)\n ",
