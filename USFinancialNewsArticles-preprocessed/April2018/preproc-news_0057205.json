    "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY, Okla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- LSB Industries, Inc. (NYSE:LXU) (“LSB” or the “Company”) today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nNet sales of $100.5 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to adjusted net sales (1) of $102.1 million for the first quarter of 2017 ($123.3 million originally reported) which excludes $17.7 million for the comparative impact to revenue from new revenue recognition standards adopted in 2018 primarily related to the Baytown facility, that are not reflected in prior year financials, and $3.5 million from businesses sold in the second and third quarters of 2017 Net loss of $5.6 million for the first quarter of 2018, an improvement of $0.4 million from a loss of $6.0 million for the first quarter of 2017 Adjusted EBITDA (1) of $21.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, up from $18.3 million ($20.0 million originally reported) excluding $1.7 million from businesses sold in 2017\n“We were pleased with our first quarter results, which were in-line with our expectations and showed improvement over the prior year period, which benefitted from $1.7 million of adjusted EBITDA from a business that we divested later in 2017,” stated Daniel Greenwell, LSB’s President and CEO. “The favorable year-over-year comparison reflects stronger pricing across most of our products along with solid operations by our facilities, particularly El Dorado, along with lower natural gas input costs.”\n“With respect to the operating performance of our facilities, El Dorado’s ammonia plant had a 100% on-stream rate in the first quarter, up from 77% in the fourth quarter of 2017. The plant continues to produce at a rate in excess of 1,300 tons per day. Cherokee’s ammonia plant ran at an 85% on-stream rate for the quarter, which included the impact of some downtime to conduct maintenance work on its primary reformer. Thus far in the second quarter, Cherokee has been running at a 99% on-stream rate, which approximates its average on-stream rate for the past six quarters. Pryor’s 91% on-stream rate in the first quarter was a meaningful increase from 22% in the fourth quarter of 2017, which reflects work completed on the facility in the second half of last year to improve reliability.\nMr. Greenwell continued, “Demand for our agricultural products for spring applications has been strong despite a slower spring application due to weather-driven planting delays. We think the late spring and compressed planting season could shift urea demand to UAN, which could benefit our second quarter. Pricing for our agricultural products was materially higher in the first quarter of 2018 relative to the prior year quarter, except for UAN pricing which was impacted by lower priced fall fill tons carried over from the fourth quarter of 2017. Demand and pricing for our industrial products reflected the continued strength in the broader U.S. economy, while our mining product volumes increased 33% as compared to the first quarter of 2017 as a result of new contract awards.”\nMr. Greenwell concluded, “Our outlook for the balance of the year remains intact, as we expect higher overall pricing relative to 2017 for the products we sell combined with improvement in plant reliability translating into stronger profitability and cash flow for 2018. We remain on track with the technological enhancements we are making to our company wide maintenance management system and expect to complete these upgrades by the end of our 2018 second quarter, which we expect to yield increasing benefits as the year progresses. Finally, the debt refinancing we completed provides us with greater financial flexibility as we were able to extend our maturities which we expect to allow us to execute our strategy aimed at delivering greater and more consistent profits and increased value for our shareholders.”\n(1) This is a Non-GAAP measure. Refer to the Non-GAAP Reconciliation section. Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (Dollars in millions) Net Sales by Market Sector\nNet\nSales\nSector\nMix\nAdjusted\nNet\nSales (1)\nSector\nMix\n%\nChange\nAgricultural $ 52.3 52 % $ 63.3 62 % (17 ) % Industrial $ 38.1 38 % $ 31.2 31 % 22 % Mining $ 10.1 10 % $ 7.6 7 % 33 % $ 100.5 $ 102.1 (2 ) % (1) Due to the January 1, 2018 adoption of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), certain industrial sales are no longer recognized. Since we adopted ASC 606 using the “modified retrospective” method, the prior periods were not restated. However, if we had applied ASC 606 to these specific arrangements during the first quarter of 2017, net sales for these products would have been reduced by approximately $17.7 million as illustrated above. Additionally, adjusted net sales is adjusted to remove revenue associated with business sold in 2017. See Non – GAAP reconciliation section for more information. Comparison of 2018 to 2017 periods:\nNet sales of our agricultural products were down 17% during the quarter relative to the prior year period. Stronger pricing for HDAN and ammonia was offset by lower ammonia volumes resulting from a slower spring application caused by cold and wet weather. UAN sales volumes were also higher in the first quarter of 2017 due to the timing of barge shipments that crossed over year-end and landed in the first quarter of 2017. Additionally, we continue to experience logistic challenges from the railroads and truck carriers. Rail service timeliness has continued to decline, and we often see roundtrip routes taking 15% to 20% longer than a year ago. With each rail car turn taking longer, we are experiencing delays in getting product out the gate. UAN volume was also impacted from lower on-stream rates at Cherokee and Pryor in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2017. Additionally, our realized pricing for UAN was negatively impacted due to the lag effect of downtime at our Pryor facility in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the carry-over of lower priced fall fill orders into the beginning of March. With respect to our industrial sales, net sales of industrial ammonia increased as a result of higher volumes from improved on-stream rates at El Dorado. Low density ammonium nitrate (LDAN) sales volumes for mining applications also increased as a result of our sales and marketing efforts and stronger overall demand from this market. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was higher compared to the prior year period primarily due to improved pricing, lower natural gas feedstock and improved industrial and mining volumes, offset by lower agricultural volume.\nThe following tables provide key sales metrics for our Agricultural products:\nThree Months Ended March 31, Product (tons sold)\n2018 2017 % Change Urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) 102,202 157,784 (35 ) %\nHigh density ammonium nitrate (HDAN) 92,713 91,171 2 %\nAmmonia 32,996 44,242 (25 ) %\nOther 4,183 4,911 (15 ) % 232,094 298,108 (22 ) % Average Selling Prices (price per ton) (A)\nUAN $ 138 $ 152 (9 ) % HDAN $ 220 $ 182 21 %\nAmmonia $ 320 $ 305 5 %\n(A) Average selling prices represent “net back” prices which are calculated as sales less freight expenses divided by product sales volume in tons.

Additionally, we had approximately $46.3 million of borrowing availability under our Working Capital Revolver. There were no borrowings under the Working Capital Revolver at March 31, 2018.\nTotal long-term debt, including the current portion, was $408.5 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $409.4 million at December 31, 2017. The aggregate liquidation value of the Series E Redeemable Preferred at March 31, 2018, inclusive of accrued dividends of $51.8 million, was $191.6 million.\nOn April 25, 2018, we issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 9.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2023. Interest on the Notes accrues at a rate of 9.625% per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2018. We used a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to repurchase, on April 25, 2018, all of our Senior Secured Notes due 2019.\nInterest expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $9.3 million compared to $9.4 million for the same period in 2017. For the full year of 2018, we expect interest expense to be approximately $40 million.\nCapital expenditures were approximately $6.2 million in the first quarter of 2018. For the full year of 2018, total capital expenditures, which are related to maintaining and enhancing safety and reliability at our facilities, are expected to be approximately $32 million.\nConference Call\nLSB’s management will host a conference call covering the fourth quarter results on April 26, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. ET/9:00 a.m. CT to discuss these results and recent corporate developments.

These non-GAAP measures are calculated using GAAP amounts in our consolidated financial statements. EBITDA Reconciliation\nEBITDA is defined as net income (loss) plus interest expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) (which includes DD&A of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible and other assets), less benefit for income taxes. We believe that certain investors consider EBITDA a useful means of measuring our ability to meet our debt service obligations and evaluating our financial performance. EBITDA has limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flow from operations or other consolidated income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, this presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of other companies. The following table provides a reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA for the periods indicated. Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018 2017 LSB Consolidated ($ in millions)\nNet loss ($5.6 ) ($6.0 ) Plus: Interest expense 9.3 9.4 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 18.3 17.6 Benefit for income taxes (0.9 ) (1.3 ) EBITDA $ 21.1 $ 19.7 LSB Industries, Inc.\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation (continued)\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is reported to show the impact of one time/non-cash items such as, loss on sale of a business and other property and equipment, one-time income or fees, start-up/commissioning costs, certain fair market value adjustments, non-cash stock-based compensation and severance costs. For comparative purposes 2017 is also adjusted to remove the impact of businesses sold during 2017. We believe that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain items. The following tables provide reconciliations of EBITDA excluding the impact of the supplementary adjustments. Our policy is to adjust for non-cash or non-recurring items that are greater than $0.5 million quarterly or cumulatively.\nLSB Consolidated ($ in millions)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018 2017\nEBITDA:\n$\n21.1\n$\n19.7\nStock-based compensation 1.4 1.2 Derecognition of death benefit accrual - (1.4 ) Loss on sale of a business and other property and equipment - 0.5 Fair market value adjustment on preferred stock embedded derivatives (0.8 ) - Adjusted EBITDA $ 21.7 $ 20.0 EBITDA from businesses sold - (1.7 ) Adjusted EBITDA excluding businesses sold in 2017 $ 21.7 $ 18.3 Net Sales Reconciliation\nSince we adopted ASC 606 using the “modified retrospective” method, the prior periods were not restated. As a result, we are presenting Adjusted Net Sales to show the impact of applying ASC 606 to certain arrangements for the first quarter of 2017 consistent with accounting treatment used for the same period in 2018. ASC had no net impact on operating income. Additionally, net sales is adjusted to remove revenue associated with businesses sold in 2017.
