    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Cryptobloc Technologies Corp., (“ Cryptobloc ” or the “ Company ”) (CSE:CRYP), (OTC:CRYBF), (Frankfurt Stock Exchange:GR9) is pleased to announce the successful completion of a Letter of Intent to acquire a minimum of 5000 Cryptomining machines from Hong Kong based, Milson Investment Holdings Ltd. This significant acquisition represents another phase of operations that is capitalizing on the promise and continued adoption of Cryptocurrencies as a staple of the new economy.\nCEO, Neil Stevenson-Moore comments:\n“As Bitcoin prices climb to a 40-day high above $9,500 USD, we are very pleased to complete this agreement and begin the process of growing our Cryptocurrency portfolio. These 5000 machines represent the foundation for our future growth and will provide a solid asset base which we can leverage for our forthcoming projects. The large majority of the 5000 machines will be state-of-the-art Bitcoin Miners; however, there will be some consideration given to miners that produce other coins that are demonstrating significant growth, application, and confidence in the market.”\nStevenson-Moore continued: “The growth we continue to witness across the Crypto landscape made the acquisition and deployment of a successful mining operation an obvious decision as a means to underpin our future plans. This agreement represents just the first of many exciting partnerships we are looking forward to sharing in the coming weeks. As always, we appreciate the patience and confidence of our shareholders as we build an exciting future for Cryptobloc.”\nAbout Cryptobloc Technologies Corp.\nBased in Vancouver, BC - Cryptobloc Technologies Corp. is focused on developing and implementing Blockchain, Distributed Ledger, Closed Loop, and Cryptocurrency services for Government and commercial partners.
