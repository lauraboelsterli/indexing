    "text": "0 COMMENTS The New York Police Department uses information collected from sealed arrest records, in violation of state law, for investigations and shares those records with prosecutors, according to a complaint filed in Manhattan Supreme Court.\nThe complaint, filed Tuesday by lawyers from the Bronx Defenders and law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, alleges the NYPD is illegally accessing and using information collected from arrests that didn’t result in convictions. It calls into question the usage and scope of the department’s arrest databases, which have long been criticized by advocates and legal officials for their secrecy.\nA NYPD spokeswoman referred comment to the city Law Department. A spokesman for the Law Department said city officials would “review the lawsuit and respond in litigation.”\nThe two state laws referenced in the suit, one enacted in 1976 and another four years later, require law enforcement agencies to destroy or return to individuals any photographs or fingerprints taken during an arrest that didn’t lead to conviction, according to the complaint. The arrest records, which become sealed, themselves can only be accessed if the NYPD obtains a court order, according to the complaint, although there are exceptions.\nPolice can access sealed records for people applying to be officers or, if someone is convicted of domestic violence.\n“The NYPD’s arrest dragnet has built a massive database that marks people for life even after they face the bar of justice and are not convicted of a crime,” Jenn Rolnick Borchetta, Deputy Director of the Bronx Defenders’ Impact Litigation Practice, said in a statement. “The NYPD’s use of sealed records violates a law that protects privacy and the presumption of innocence.”\nIn a case described in the complaint, a Bronx man identified as “ R.C. ” was allegedly sleeping at his mother’s home in Wappingers Falls, N.Y., in May 2015 when she woke him up to tell him the police were at the door to arrest him for a robbing a livery driver.\nDuring criminal discovery in his case, Bronx prosecutors unveiled documents with information on R.C. from NYPD databases, according to the complaint.\nThe “snapshot” from the database had information, including a photograph, from a 2011 arrest that was dismissed and sealed, meaning that information shouldn’t have been used, according to the complaint.\nREAD MORE NEW YORK COVERAGE\nIn West Harlem, a Tuskegee Airman Gets His Due April 25, 2018 New York City Is Getting a Pizza Museum April 25, 2018 ‘Smallville’ Actress Accused of Participating in Cultlike Group Released From Jail April 24, 2018 SL Green Inks Another Huge Lease Deal for One Vanderbilt April 24, 2018 At School With New York’s Next Top Chef, or Line Cook April 23, 2018 A NYPD officer included that image in an array to a witness, who then selected R.C.’s photograph.\nProsecutors later recommended his robbery charges be dismissed and they were. R.C. was outside of the city, at the time of the crime, according to the complaint. But in the year and a half he faced the charges, his repeated trips to the Bronx for court appearances from Wappingers Falls made it difficult to work his shifts at a restaurant and he eventually lost his job, according to the complaint.\n“R.C. experienced emotional distress, fear, anxiety and anger as a result of the arrest and prosecution,” according to the complaint. “He began to internalize the accusation. He began to feel like he was a criminal even though he was innocent.”\nWrite to Zolan Kanno-Youngs at Zolan.Kanno-Youngs@wsj.com",
