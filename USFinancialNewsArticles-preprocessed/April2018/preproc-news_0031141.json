    "text": "BEND, Oregon, April 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nGuardian Group, a \"Team of Teams\" comprised of former military special operations, law enforcement and intelligence community professionals dedicated to fighting human trafficking, announced today that Michael S. Young has been appointed to the Board of Directors.\nThe Guardian Group's team, which has decades of experience with organizations such as the U.S. Department of State, Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, and Department of Justice, partners with the public and private sectors to teach employees about sex trafficking and equip them to recognize and respond to suspected incidents. In addition, the elite team actively pursues predators when rescue is necessary.\nThe Guardian Seal®, the group's primary online educational training program, is a strong, readily recognized mark that significantly deters would-be traffickers and buyers. Companies that endorse the Guardian Seal® play a critical role in the fight against human trafficking by recognizing that illicit activity puts brand reputation at risk and endangers employees and guests. Supporters of The Guardian Seal include the hospitality industry, law enforcement, transportation industry, emergency services, corporations, government agencies, and the public.\n\"It is a great honor to serve on the board of Guardian Group in this capacity, because anyone who knows the team knows that they are a world class organization. I look forward to making any contribution that might further enhance their excellence. Human trafficking is the third largest international crime industry and the #1 fastest growing crime industry at home and abroad. Failure is not an option as we fight this horrific crime,\" said Michael S. Young.\n\" We are excited to welcome Michael Young to our team and are confident that his many years of high-level business experience will be a great asset to our group as we ramp up our efforts to 'Bring the Full Fight to Human Trafficking' . Mike brings another set of skills and perspectives that are essential to the growth of our team. He will help us build the coalition of willing partners, corporations, and industries, that are needed to impact the crime of sex trafficking across the U.S. in an irreversible way. We are dedicated to building a strong network of professionals to take a stand and fight, and we are glad to include him,\" said Guardian Group Chief Operating Officer Jeff Tiegs.\nAbout Guardian Group\nGuardian Group is a 501c3 nonprofit organization headquartered in Bend, Oregon.
