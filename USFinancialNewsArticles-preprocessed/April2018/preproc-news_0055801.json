    "text": "INDIANAPOLIS, April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today the Board of Directors of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis (\"FHLBank Indianapolis\" or \"Bank\") declared its first quarter 2018 dividends on Class B-1 and Class B-2 capital stock at annualized rates of 4.25% and 3.40%, respectively. The dividends will be paid in cash on April 27, 2018.\nEarnings Highlights 1\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was $48 million, an increase of $16 million compared to the same quarter in the prior year, primarily due to higher net interest income as well as net gains on derivatives and hedging activities. Net interest income after provision for credit losses was $70 million, an increase of $11 million compared to the same quarter in the prior year, primarily as a result of an increase in the average balance of assets throughout the quarter.\nAffordable Housing Program Allocation 2\nAs a direct result of our earnings for the first quarter of 2018, FHLBank Indianapolis allocated $6 million to its Affordable Housing Program (\"AHP\"), which provides grant funding to support housing for low- and moderate-income families in Michigan and Indiana. Full year 2018 AHP allocations will be available to the Bank's members in 2019 to help address their communities' affordable housing needs, including construction, rehabilitation, accessibility improvements and homebuyer down-payment assistance.\n(1) FHLBank Indianapolis earns interest income on advances to and mortgage loans purchased from its Michigan and Indiana member financial institutions, as well as on long- and short-term investments. Net interest income is primarily determined by the spread between the interest earned on those assets and the interest cost of funding with consolidated obligations. (2) Each year FHLBanks allocate to the AHP 10% of earnings, which is defined as income before assessments, plus interest expense on mandatorily redeemable capital stock. Balance Sheet Highlights\nTotal assets at March 31, 2018 were $61.4 billion, a decrease of $1.0 billion, or 2%, from December 31, 2017, primarily driven by a decrease in advances outstanding.\nAdvances 3\nAdvances outstanding at March 31, 2018 totaled $33.0 billion, a net decrease of $1.1 billion, or 3%, from December 31, 2017, substantially due to a decline in short-term advances outstanding.\nAdvances to depository members - comprising commercial banks, savings institutions and credit unions - decreased by 1%. Advances to insurance company members decreased by 5%. Advances to depository institutions, as a percent of total advances outstanding, increased from 55% at December 31, 2017 to 56% at March 31, 2018, while advances to insurance companies decreased from 45% to 44% at those dates.\nMortgage Loans Held for Portfolio 4\nMortgage loan purchases from members for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $429 million. Mortgage loans held for portfolio at March 31, 2018 totaled $10.5 billion, a net increase of $139 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2017.\nConsolidated Obligations 5\nFHLBank Indianapolis' consolidated obligations outstanding at March 31, 2018 totaled $57.3 billion, a net decrease of $919 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2017. The decrease in consolidated obligations was primarily related to the decrease in the Bank's advances outstanding.\nCapital 6\nTotal capital at March 31, 2018 was $3.0 billion, a net increase of $63 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of additional capital stock issued to members and unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities. The growth of retained earnings also contributed to the increase.\nThe Bank's regulatory capital 7 -to-assets ratio at March 31, 2018 was 4.95%, which exceeds all applicable regulatory capital requirements.\n(3) Advances are secured loans that FHLBank Indianapolis provides to its member institutions. (4) FHLBank Indianapolis purchases mortgage loans from its members to support its housing mission, provide an additional source of liquidity to its members, and diversify its investments. (5) The primary source of funds for FHLBank Indianapolis, and for the other Federal Home Loan Banks (\"FHLBanks\"), is the sale of FHLBanks' consolidated obligations in the capital markets. FHLBank Indianapolis is the primary obligor for the payment of the principal and interest on these consolidated obligations; additionally, it is jointly and severally liable with each of the other FHLBanks for all of the FHLBanks' consolidated obligations outstanding. (6) FHLBank Indianapolis is a cooperative whose member financial institutions and former members own all of its capital stock as a condition of membership and to support outstanding credit products. (7) Total regulatory capital consists of capital stock, mandatorily redeemable capital stock and retained earnings. All amounts referenced above and in the following table are unaudited. More detailed information about FHLBank Indianapolis' financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 will be included in the Bank's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which we intend to file by mid-May.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis\nFinancial Highlights (unaudited) ($ amounts in millions, as rounded) Three Months Ended March 31, Condensed Statements of Income 2018 2017 Net interest income after provision for credit losses $ 70 $ 59 Other income (loss) 6 (3 ) Other expenses 22 20 AHP assessments 6 4 Net income 48 32\nCondensed Statements of Condition March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Advances $ 32,965 $ 34,055 Mortgage loans held for portfolio, net 10,496 10,356 Cash and short-term investments 4,386 4,601 Other assets (1) 13,545 13,337 Total assets $ 61,392 $ 62,349 Consolidated obligations $ 57,335 $ 58,254 Mandatorily redeemable capital stock 164 164 Other liabilities 884 985 Total liabilities 58,383 59,403 Capital stock (2) 1,881 1,858 Retained earnings (3) 993 976 Accumulated other comprehensive income 135 112 Total capital 3,009 2,946 Total liabilities and capital $ 61,392 $ 62,349 Total regulatory capital (4) $ 3,038 $ 2,998 Regulatory capital-to-assets ratio 4.95 % 4.81 % (1) Includes held-to-maturity securities and available-for-sale securities.
