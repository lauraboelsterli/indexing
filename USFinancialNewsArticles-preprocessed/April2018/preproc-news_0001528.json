    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- HCB Health, one of the country’s leading healthcare advertising agencies, announced Francesco Lucarelli’s new role as senior vice president, strategy and account services. His new responsibilities will focus on further evolving the internal structure of HCB Health with an optimized pharmaceutical division as well as overseeing the work product that falls into his business unit.\nLucarelli comes from a background of over 21 years in pharmaceutical and device marketing. After being with HCB Health for over a year, his new role will help ensure talent-to-task alignment within the agency.\n“Francesco (Lucarelli) has made a tremendous impact on the agency in the past year, and this expanded role will help us keep up with our growth,” said HCB Health CEO, Kerry Hilton.\nIn recent months, HCB Health has taken on a number of new pharmaceutical clients and continues to add talent and discipline to support the multifaceted environment of pharmaceutical marketing. Lucarelli is currently helping to lead multiple pharmaceutical brands on both coasts of the U.S.\n“As our pharmaceutical division continues to grow exponentially, we want to ensure that we are invested in talent and learning as an agency,” said Lucarelli. “Our fresh perspective is one of the reasons our work in pharma is being recognized and awarded.”\nHCB Health is an independent, full-service healthcare communications agency serving pharmaceutical, medical device and biotech clients. Headquartered in Austin, Texas, with offices in Chicago and New Jersey, HCB Health has built a presence outside of the traditional pharma ad agency mold for the past 16 years. HCB Health’s independence frees them from the constraints that plague larger agency networks. Their mantra: “We listen.” They genuinely believe that listening to their clients and their customers is the best way to build happy and healthy brands.\nTo learn more about HCB Health, visit HCBHealth.com or follow them on LinkedIn at linkedin.com/company/hcb-health and on Facebook at facebook.com/HCBHealth .\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180403005258/en/\nHCB Health\nTaylor Watson, 512-439-7017\ntaylor.watson@hcbhealth.com\nSource: HCB Health",
