He gave up 10 hits and two walks in three innings while striking out four. Two of the runs charged against him were unearned.\nThe Dodgers scored three in the first, one in the second and then scored five on five hits in the third before Perdomo retired a hitter.\nCorey Seager drew a one-out walk in the first, advanced to third on a single by Yasmani Grandal and scored on a single by Cody Bellinger. Matt Kemp then topped a single up the third base line, and Christian Villanueva’s wild throw to first allowed Grandal and Bellinger to score.\nMuncy drew a walk to lead off the second, moved to second on a bunt by Maeda and scored on Seager’s single.\nBellinger doubled to open the third and came around on singles by Kemp and Joc Pederson. Utley then hit his two-run double and Muncy followed with his first homer of the season.\nThe Dodgers reached double digits for the second time in the series when Grandal doubled home Chris Taylor in the eighth. Los Angeles added three more in the ninth on an RBI single by Yasiel Puig and a two-run double by Seager. The Dodgers ran their hit total for the game to 18.\nSeager had four hits and three RBIs while Grandal, Bellinger, Pederson, Enrique Hernandez and Kemp each had two.\nThe Dodgers outscored the Padres 30-10 over the three games, and Los Angeles pitchers had 45 strikeouts in 30 innings.\nCarlos Asuaje had a single, a double and two RBIs for the Padres.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
