    "text": "April 12, 2018 / 7:11 AM / Updated an hour ago Tottenham must be ready for Man City backlash - Davies Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Tottenham Hotspur must be ready for a Manchester City side that has been stung by three consecutive defeats, defender Ben Davies said ahead of Saturday’s Premier League encounter. Soccer Football - Premier League - Stoke City vs Tottenham Hotspur - bet365 Stadium, Stoke-on-Trent, Britain - April 7, 2018 Tottenham's Ben Davies, Eric Dier, Danny Rose and Christian Eriksen on the pitch before the match REUTERS/Dylan Martinez \nCity’s 3-2 home league defeat by Manchester United was sandwiched between the two legs of their Champions League quarter-final against Liverpool, which saw Pep Guardiola’s side lose both to go out 5-1 on aggregate. \n“I’m pretty sure they are going to be desperate for the win after the results they have had this week,” Davies told Sky Sports News. \n“It’s been a sticky patch for them but they have been flawless this season. It is going to be a tough game, we are definitely expecting them to come all guns blazing and we’ve got to be ready for that.” \nTottenham are unbeaten in the league since a 4-1 defeat by City at the Etihad in December. \nCity could wrap up the title if they beat Spurs and United lose at home to bottom-side West Bromwich Albion.
