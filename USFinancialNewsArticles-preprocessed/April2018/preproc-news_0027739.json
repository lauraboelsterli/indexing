    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - CIA Director Mike Pompeo, U.S. President Donald Trump’s nominee to be secretary of state, said on Thursday he “wants to fix” the international Iran nuclear deal.\nU.S. sanctions that were lifted under the 2015 agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), will resume unless Trump waives them again on May 12. Trump has effectively set that as a deadline for European powers to “fix the terrible flaws” of the deal.\nPompeo told his Senate confirmation hearing that he would still push for a tougher deal even if Trump decides not to waive the sanctions.\nReporting by Patricia Zengerle and Lesley Wroughton; Editing by Frances Kerry\n ",
