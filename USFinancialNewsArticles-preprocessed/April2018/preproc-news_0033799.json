Excluding notable items in the fourth quarter of 2017, net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp increased 9.3 percent. Diluted earnings per common share were $0.96 in the first quarter of 2018. Results for the first quarter of 2018 included favorable tax matters partially offset by the impact of a transitional change in stock-based compensation vesting provisions, that combined, increased diluted earnings per common share by $0.01. Diluted earnings per common share were $0.97 in the fourth quarter of 2017, which included $0.09 of notable items, including a benefit of $910 million related to the estimated impact of tax reform on the Company’s tax related assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $608 million accrual for regulatory and legal matters, and $152 million, net of tax, for a charitable contribution to the U.S. Bank Foundation and a special bonus to certain eligible employees. The increase in net income year-over-year was primarily due to total net revenue growth of 3.4 percent (3.9 percent excluding the impact of tax reform related to taxable-equivalent adjustments for tax exempt assets), including an increase in net interest income of 5.5 percent, mainly a result of the impact of rising interest rates and loan growth. Noninterest income increased 0.6 percent principally due to higher payment services revenue, trust and investment management fees and deposit service charges, offset by decreases in mortgage banking revenue and commercial product revenue in addition to lower equity investment income and securities gains compared with a year ago. The increase in total net revenue was partially offset by higher noninterest expense of 5.0 percent (3.7 percent excluding the impact of stock-based compensation vesting changes), primarily due to increased compensation expense related to hiring to support business growth and compliance programs, merit increases, variable compensation related to revenue growth, increased expense from a change to a shorter vesting period for new stock-based compensation grants, and higher employee benefits expense, partially offset by lower professional services expense driven by lower consulting costs for risk and compliance programs, and other expenses.\nExcluding the fourth quarter 2017 notable items, net income increased on a linked quarter basis primarily due to the impact of the lower corporate tax rate effective in 2018. Total net revenue decreased 2.3 percent and noninterest expense decreased 0.6 percent. The decrease in total net revenue reflected a decrease in net interest income of 1.0 percent, due to two fewer days in the first quarter, and a decrease in noninterest income of 4.1 percent driven by seasonally lower payment services fees and mortgage banking revenue and lower equity investment income. The decrease in noninterest expense was primarily driven by seasonally lower costs related to investments in tax-advantaged projects, mortgage banking costs and professional services expense, offset by increased compensation expense primarily related to the timing of stock-based compensation grants, and associated vesting period changes, and seasonally higher employee benefits expense.\nNET INTEREST INCOME (Taxable-equivalent basis; $ in millions) Change 1Q 4Q 1Q 1Q18 vs 1Q18 vs 2018 2017 2017 4Q17 1Q17 Components of net interest income Income on earning assets $3,822 $3,785 $3,444 $37 $378 Expense on interest-bearing liabilities 625 557 414 68 211 Net interest income $3,197 $3,228 $3,030 $(31 ) $167 Average yields and rates paid Earning assets yield 3.75 % 3.64 % 3.48 % .11 % .27 % Rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities .81 .72 .57 .09 .24 Gross interest margin 2.94 % 2.92 % 2.91 % .02 % .03 % Net interest margin 3.13 % 3.11 % 3.06 % .02 % .07 % Average balances Investment securities (a) $113,493 $113,287 $110,764 $206 $2,729 Loans 279,388 279,751 273,158 (363 ) 6,230 Earning assets 411,849 413,510 399,281 (1,661 ) 12,568 Interest-bearing liabilities 311,615 308,976 296,170 2,639 15,445 (a) Excludes unrealized gain (loss) Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in the first quarter of 2018 was $3,197 million, an increase of $167 million (5.5 percent) over the first quarter of 2017. The increase was principally driven by the impact of rising interest rates and loan growth, partially offset by deposit and funding mix and the impact of tax reform which reduced the taxable-equivalent adjustment benefit related to tax exempt assets. Average earning assets were $12.6 billion (3.1 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2017, reflecting increases of $6.2 billion (2.3 percent) in average total loans, $2.7 billion (2.5 percent) in average investment securities and $4.1 billion (34.9 percent) in average other earning assets. Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis decreased $31 million (1.0 percent) on a linked quarter basis primarily driven by the impact of two fewer days in the first quarter, tax reform, and deposit and funding mix, partially offset by the impact of higher rates. Average earning assets were $1.7 billion (0.4 percent) lower on a linked quarter basis, reflecting decreases of $363 million (0.1 percent) in average total loans and $717 million (4.3 percent) in average other earning assets, partially offset by an increase of $206 million (0.2 percent) in average investment securities.\nThe net interest margin in the first quarter of 2018 was 3.13 percent, compared with 3.06 percent in the first quarter of 2017, and 3.11 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the impact of tax reform related to tax exempt income, the linked quarter increase in net interest margin was 4 basis points. The increase in the net interest margin year-over-year and on a linked quarter basis was primarily due to higher interest rates, partially offset by loan mix, higher funding costs and higher cash balances year-over-year. The first quarter 2018 adoption of a new accounting standard related to revenue recognition increased net interest income and the related margin compared with previously reported results. All periods have been adjusted to reflect this change.\nAverage investment securities in the first quarter of 2018 were $2.7 billion (2.5 percent) higher year-over-year and $206 million (0.2 percent) higher than the prior quarter. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to purchases of U.S. Treasury and U.S. government mortgage-backed securities, net of prepayments and maturities, in support of liquidity management.\nAVERAGE LOANS ($ in millions) Percent Change 1Q 4Q 1Q 1Q18 vs 1Q18 vs 2018 2017 2017 4Q17 1Q17 Commercial $91,933 $92,101 $88,284 (.2 ) 4.1 Lease financing 5,532 5,457 5,455 1.4 1.4 Total commercial 97,465 97,558 93,739 (.1 ) 4.0 Commercial mortgages 29,176 29,543 31,461 (1.2 ) (7.3 ) Construction and development 11,190 11,466 11,697 (2.4 ) (4.3 ) Total commercial real estate 40,366 41,009 43,158 (1.6 ) (6.5 ) Residential mortgages 60,174 59,639 57,900 .9 3.9 Credit card 21,284 21,218 20,845 .3 2.1 Retail leasing 7,982 7,982 6,469 -- 23.4 Home equity and second mortgages 16,195 16,299 16,259 (.6 ) (.4 ) Other 32,874 32,856 31,056 .1 5.9 Total other retail 57,051 57,137 53,784 (.2 ) 6.1 Total loans, excluding covered loans 276,340 276,561 269,426 (.1 ) 2.6 Covered loans 3,048 3,190 3,732 (4.5 ) (18.3 ) Total loans $279,388 $279,751 $273,158 (.1 ) 2.3 Average total loans were $6.2 billion (2.3 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2017. The increase was due to growth in total commercial loans (4.0 percent), residential mortgages (3.9 percent), retail leasing (23.4 percent) and other retail loans (5.9 percent). These increases were muted somewhat by a decrease in total commercial real estate loans (6.5 percent) due to disciplined underwriting and customers paying down balances. Loan growth was also muted by continued run-off of the covered loans portfolio (18.3 percent). Average total loans were $363 million (0.1 percent) lower than the fourth quarter of 2017. This decrease reflects continued pay-offs of commercial real estate loans (1.6 percent) and the run-off of covered loans (4.5 percent), offset by growth in residential mortgages (0.9 percent). At the end of the first quarter, approximately $1.5 billion of student loans were transferred from the loan portfolio to loans held for sale.\nAVERAGE DEPOSITS ($ in millions) Percent Change 1Q 4Q 1Q 1Q18 vs 1Q18 vs 2018 2017 2017 4Q17 1Q17 Noninterest-bearing deposits $79,482 $82,303 $80,738 (3.4 ) (1.6 ) Interest-bearing savings deposits Interest checking 70,358 70,717 65,681 (.5 ) 7.1 Money market savings 103,367 105,348 108,759 (1.9 ) (5.0 ) Savings accounts 44,388 43,772 42,609 1.4 4.2 Total savings deposits 218,113 219,837 217,049 (.8 ) .5 Time deposits 36,985 37,022 30,646 (.1 ) 20.7 Total interest-bearing deposits 255,098 256,859 247,695 (.7 ) 3.0 Total deposits $334,580 $339,162 $328,433 (1.4 ) 1.9 Average total deposits for the first quarter of 2018 were $6.1 billion (1.9 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2017. Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $1.3 billion (1.6 percent) year-over-year primarily due to a decrease in Corporate and Commercial Banking, partially offset by increases in Consumer and Business Banking and Wealth Management and Investment Services. Average total savings deposits were $1.1 billion (0.5 percent) higher year-over-year driven by growth in Consumer and Business Banking, partially offset by a decrease in Corporate and Commercial Banking. Average time deposits were $6.3 billion (20.7 percent) higher than the prior year quarter. Changes in time deposits are largely related to those deposits managed as an alternative to other funding sources such as wholesale borrowing, based largely on relative pricing and liquidity characteristics.\nAverage total deposits decreased $4.6 billion (1.4 percent) from the fourth quarter of 2017. On a linked quarter basis, average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $2.8 billion (3.4 percent) across all business lines primarily due to seasonality. This compares with a decline in noninterest-bearing deposits of $4.2 billion (4.9 percent) in the first quarter of 2017 compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Average total savings deposits decreased $1.7 billion (0.8 percent) reflecting a decline in Wealth Management and Investment Services of $2.1 billion and Corporate and Commercial Banking of $1.3 billion, partially offset by growth in average savings balances within Consumer and Business Banking. The change in Corporate and Commercial Banking balances primarily reflects seasonality, while the decline in Wealth Management and Investment Services is the result of seasonally lower trust balances, timing of escrowed balances, deployment of cash balances by investment managers and the impact of rising interest rates. Average time deposits, which are managed based on funding needs, relative pricing and liquidity characteristics, were flat on a linked quarter basis.\nNONINTEREST INCOME ($ in millions) Percent Change 1Q 4Q 1Q 1Q18 vs 1Q18 vs 2018 2017 2017 4Q17 1Q17 Credit and debit card revenue $324 $342 $299 (5.3 ) 8.4 Corporate payment products revenue 154 148 137 4.1 12.4 Merchant processing services 363 374 354 (2.9 ) 2.5 ATM processing services 79 80 71 (1.3 ) 11.3 Trust and investment management fees 398 394 368 1.0 8.2 Deposit service charges 182 194 172 (6.2 ) 5.8 Treasury management fees 150 152 153 (1.3 ) (2.0 ) Commercial products revenue 220 224 247 (1.8 ) (10.9 ) Mortgage banking revenue 184 202 207 (8.9 ) (11.1 ) Investment products fees 46 45 42 2.2 9.5 Securities gains (losses), net 5 10 29 (50.0 ) (82.8 ) Other 167 205 180 (18.5 ) (7.2 ) Total noninterest income $2,272 $2,370 $2,259 (4.1 ) .6 First quarter noninterest income of $2,272 million was $13 million (0.6 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2017 reflecting strong growth in payment services revenue, trust and investment management fees, and deposit service charges, partially offset by lower commercial products revenue and mortgage banking revenue reflecting industry trends in these revenue categories. Payment services revenue increased 6.5 percent due to stronger credit and debit card revenue of $25 million (8.4 percent) and an increase in corporate payment products revenue of $17 million (12.4 percent), and improving merchant processing revenue due to higher sales volumes. Trust and investment management fees increased $30 million (8.2 percent) due to business growth, net asset inflows and favorable market conditions. Deposit service charges increased $10 million (5.8 percent) primarily due to higher transaction volumes and account growth. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in commercial products revenue of $27 million (10.9 percent) mainly due to lower corporate bond underwriting fees and syndication fees. Mortgage banking revenue decreased $23 million (11.1 percent) primarily due to lower margin on mortgage loan sales.\nNoninterest income was $98 million (4.1 percent) lower in the first quarter of 2018 compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 reflecting seasonally lower payment services revenue, mortgage banking revenue and deposit service charges. In addition, other revenue decreased $38 million (18.5 percent) primarily due to lower equity investment income. Payment services revenue decreased principally due to seasonally lower sales volume after the holidays. Credit and debit card revenue declined $18 million (5.3 percent) while merchant processing services revenue declined $11 million (2.9 percent). Corporate payments products revenue increased from the fourth quarter by 4.1 percent reflecting stronger corporate and government spending. Mortgage banking revenue decreased $18 million (8.9 percent) primarily due to lower margin on mortgage loan sales, partially offset by the valuation of mortgage servicing rights, net of hedging activities. Deposit service charges decreased $12 million (6.2 percent) due to seasonally lower transaction volumes.\nNONINTEREST EXPENSE ($ in millions) Percent Change 1Q 4Q 1Q 1Q18 vs 1Q18 vs 2018 2017 2017 4Q17 1Q17 Compensation $1,523 $1,499 $1,391 1.6 9.5 Employee benefits 330 291 301 13.4 9.6 Net occupancy and equipment 265 259 247 2.3 7.3 Professional services 83 114 96 (27.2 ) (13.5 ) Marketing and business development 97 251 90 (61.4 ) 7.8 Technology and communications 235 236 217 (.4 ) 8.3 Postage, printing and supplies 80 79 81 1.3 (1.2 ) Other intangibles 39 44 44 (11.4 ) (11.4 ) Other 403 1,126 442 (64.2 ) (8.8 ) Total noninterest expense $3,055 $3,899 $2,909 (21.6 ) 5.0 First quarter noninterest expense of $3,055 million was $146 million (5.0 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to higher personnel expense, occupancy costs, technology investment and seasonal marketing and development expenses, partially offset by lower professional services expense and other noninterest expense. Compensation expense increased $132 million (9.5 percent) principally due to the impact of hiring to support business growth and compliance programs, merit increases, and higher variable compensation related to business production, and the impact of changes in vesting provisions related to stock-based compensation programs. Excluding the impact of the change in vesting provisions, compensation would have increased 6.9 percent from a year ago. Employee benefits expense increased $29 million (9.6 percent) primarily driven by increased medical costs and staffing. Other noninterest expense decreased $39 million (8.8 percent) due to lower mortgage servicing-related costs and lower pension-related costs as a result of contributions to the plans in 2017. Professional services expense decreased $13 million (13.5 percent) primarily due to fewer consulting services as compliance programs near maturity.\nNoninterest expense decreased $844 million (21.6 percent) on a linked quarter basis primarily due to notable items recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the notable items, noninterest expense was $19 million (0.6 percent) lower in the first quarter of 2018 compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to seasonally lower costs related to investments in tax-advantaged projects and professional services expense, partially offset by higher personnel expense. Compensation expense increased $82 million (5.7 percent) reflecting the impact of variable compensation including the timing of stock-based compensation grants due to the vesting change, and merit increases, as well as a seasonal increase in employee benefits expense of $48 million (17.0 percent) primarily driven by seasonally higher payroll taxes.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for the first quarter of 2018 resulted in a tax rate of 18.9 percent on a taxable-equivalent basis (effective tax rate of 17.7 percent), compared with 27.0 percent (effective tax rate of 25.1 percent) in the first quarter of 2017, and a tax benefit of 23.6 percent on a taxable-equivalent basis (effective tax benefit of 28.6 percent) in the fourth quarter of 2017. The first quarter of 2018 tax rate reflected the tax reform legislation enacted during the fourth quarter of 2017, favorable settlement of tax matters, and the tax benefit of restricted stock vesting and option exercises.\nALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ($ in millions) 1Q 4Q 3Q 2Q 1Q 2018 % (b) 2017 % (b) 2017 % (b) 2017 % (b) 2017 % (b) Balance, beginning of period $4,417 $4,407 $4,377 $4,366 $4,357 Net charge-offs Commercial 56 .25 22 .09 79 .34 75 .33 71 .33 Lease financing 4 .29 6 .44 4 .29 3 .22 4 .30 Total commercial 60 .25 28 .11 83 .34 78 .33 75 .32 Commercial mortgages (4 ) (.06 ) 18 .24 (2 ) (.03 ) (7 ) (.09 ) (1 ) (.01 ) Construction and development 1 .04 -- -- (5 ) (.17 ) (2 ) (.07 ) (1 ) (.03 ) Total commercial real estate (3 ) (.03 ) 18 .17 (7 ) (.07 ) (9 ) (.08 ) (2 ) (.02 ) Residential mortgages 7 .05 10 .07 7 .05 8 .05 12 .08 Credit card 211 4.02 205 3.83 187 3.55 204 3.97 190 3.70 Retail leasing 3 .15 3 .15 2 .10 2 .11 3 .19 Home equity and second mortgages (1 ) (.03 ) (2 ) (.05 ) (1 ) (.02 ) (1 ) (.02 ) (1 ) (.02 ) Other 64 .79 63 .76 59 .73 58 .75 58 .76 Total other retail 66 .47 64 .44 60 .42 59 .43 60 .45 Total net charge-offs, excluding covered loans 341 .50 325 .47 330 .48 340 .50 335 .50 Covered loans -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Total net charge-offs 341 .49 325 .46 330 .47 340 .49 335 .50 Provision for credit losses 341 335 360 350 345 Other changes (a) -- -- -- 1 (1 ) Balance, end of period $4,417 $4,417 $4,407 $4,377 $4,366 Components Allowance for loan losses $3,918 $3,925 $3,908 $3,856 $3,816 Liability for unfunded credit commitments\n499 492 499 521 550 Total allowance for credit losses $4,417 $4,417 $4,407 $4,377 $4,366 Gross charge-offs $453 $464 $433 $437 $417 Gross recoveries $112 $139 $103 $97 $82 Allowance for credit losses as a percentage of Period-end loans, excluding covered loans\n1.60 1.58 1.59 1.59 1.61 Nonperforming loans, excluding covered loans\n431 438 425 385 338 Nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets\n373 374 359 331 296 Period-end loans 1.59 1.58 1.58 1.58 1.60 Nonperforming loans 431 438 426 383 338 Nonperforming assets 367 368 352 324 292 (a) Includes net changes in credit losses to be reimbursed by the FDIC and reductions in the allowance for covered loans where the reversal of a previously recorded allowance was offset by an associated decrease in the indemnification asset, and the impact of any loan sales.\n(b) Annualized and calculated on average loan balances The Company’s provision for credit losses for the first quarter of 2018 was $341 million, which was $6 million (1.8 percent) higher than the prior quarter and $4 million (1.2 percent) lower than the first quarter of 2017. Credit quality was relatively stable compared with the fourth quarter of 2017.\nTotal net charge-offs in the first quarter of 2018 were $341 million, compared with $325 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and $335 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net charge-offs increased $16 million (4.9 percent) compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 mainly due to higher total commercial loan net charge-offs driven by lower recoveries, partially offset by lower total commercial real estate net charge-offs. Net charge-offs increased $6 million (1.8 percent) compared with the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to higher credit card loan net charge-offs, partially offset by lower total commercial loan net charge-offs driven by higher recoveries. The net charge-off ratio was 0.49 percent in the first quarter of 2018, compared with 0.46 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 0.50 percent in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe allowance for credit losses was $4,417 million at March 31, 2018, and at December 31, 2017, compared with $4,366 million at March 31, 2017. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans was 1.59 percent at March 31, 2018, compared with 1.58 percent at December 31, 2017, and 1.60 percent at March 31, 2017. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 431 percent at March 31, 2018, compared with 438 percent at December 31, 2017, and 338 percent at March 31, 2017.\nNonperforming assets were $1,204 million at March 31, 2018, compared with $1,200 million at December 31, 2017, and $1,495 million at March 31, 2017. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 0.43 percent at March 31, 2018, and at December 31, 2017, compared with 0.55 percent at March 31, 2017. The year-over-year decrease in nonperforming assets was driven by improvements in nonperforming total commercial loans, residential mortgages and other real estate owned, partially offset by increases in nonperforming other retail loans and total commercial real estate loans. Accruing loans 90 days or more past due were $702 million ($566 million excluding covered loans) at March 31, 2018, compared with $720 million ($572 million excluding covered loans) at December 31, 2017, and $718 million ($524 million excluding covered loans) at March 31, 2017.\nDELINQUENT LOAN RATIOS AS A PERCENT OF ENDING LOAN BALANCES (Percent) Mar 31 Dec 31 Sep 30 Jun 30 Mar 31 2018 2017 2017 2017 2017 Delinquent loan ratios - 90 days or more past due excluding nonperforming loans Commercial .06 .06 .05 .05 .06 Commercial real estate .01 .01 .01 -- .01 Residential mortgages .22 .22 .18 .20 .24 Credit card 1.29 1.28 1.20 1.10 1.23 Other retail .18 .17 .15 .14 .14 Total loans, excluding covered loans .21 .21 .18 .17 .19 Covered loans 4.57 4.74 4.66 4.71 5.34 Total loans .25 .26 .23 .23 .26 Delinquent loan ratios - 90 days or more past due including nonperforming loans Commercial .37 .31 .33 .39 .52 Commercial real estate .31 .37 .30 .29 .27 Residential mortgages .93 .96 .98 1.10 1.23 Credit card 1.29 1.28 1.20 1.10 1.24 Other retail .48 .46 .43 .42 .43 Total loans, excluding covered loans .58 .57 .55 .59 .67 Covered loans 4.77 4.93 4.84 5.06 5.53 Total loans .62 .62 .60 .64 .73 ASSET QUALITY (a) ($ in millions) Mar 31 Dec 31 Sep 30 Jun 30 Mar 31 2018 2017 2017 2017 2017 Nonperforming loans Commercial $274 $225 $231 $283 $397 Lease financing 27 24 38 39 42 Total commercial 301 249 269 322 439 Commercial mortgages 86 108 89 84 74 Construction and development 33 34 33 35 36 Total commercial real estate 119 142 122 119 110 Residential mortgages 430 442 474 530 575 Credit card -- 1 1 1 2 Other retail 168 168 163 158 157 Total nonperforming loans, excluding covered loans 1,018 1,002 1,029 1,130 1,283 Covered loans 6 6 6 12 7 Total nonperforming loans 1,024 1,008 1,035 1,142 1,290 Other real estate 124 141 164 157 155 Covered other real estate 20 21 26 25 22 Other nonperforming assets 36 30 26 25 28 Total nonperforming assets $1,204 $1,200 $1,251 $1,349 $1,495 Total nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets $1,178 $1,173 $1,219 $1,312 $1,466 Accruing loans 90 days or more past due, excluding covered loans\n$566 $572 $497 $477 $524 Accruing loans 90 days or more past due $702 $720 $649 $639 $718 Performing restructured loans, excluding GNMA and covered loans\n$2,190 $2,306 $2,419 $2,473 $2,478 Performing restructured GNMA and covered loans $1,598 $1,713 $1,600 $1,803 $1,746 Nonperforming assets to loans plus ORE, excluding covered assets (%)\n.43 .42 .44 .48 .54 Nonperforming assets to loans plus ORE (%) .43 .43 .45 .49 .55 (a) Throughout this document, nonperforming assets and related ratios do not include accruing loans 90 days or more past due COMMON SHARES (Millions) 1Q 4Q 3Q 2Q 1Q 2018 2017 2017 2017 2017 Beginning shares outstanding 1,656 1,667 1,679 1,692 1,697 Shares issued for stock incentive plans, acquisitions and other corporate purposes\n4 1 -- 1 6 Shares repurchased (11 ) (12 ) (12 ) (14 ) (11 ) Ending shares outstanding 1,649 1,656 1,667 1,679 1,692 CAPITAL POSITION ($ in millions) Mar 31 Dec 31 Sep 30 Jun 30 Mar 31 2018 2017 2017 2017 2017 Total U.S. Bancorp shareholders' equity $49,187 $49,040 $48,723 $48,320 $47,798 Basel III Standardized Approach (a) Common equity tier 1 capital $33,539 $34,369 $34,876 $34,408 $33,847 Tier 1 capital 38,991 39,806 40,411 39,943 39,374 Total risk-based capital 46,640 47,503 48,104 47,824 47,279 Fully implemented common equity tier 1 capital ratio (a) 9.0 % 9.1 % (b)\n9.4 % (b)\n9.3 % (b)\n9.2 % (b)\nTier 1 capital ratio 10.4 10.8 11.1 11.1 11.0 Total risk-based capital ratio 12.5 12.9 13.2 13.2 13.3 Leverage ratio 8.8 8.9 9.1 9.1 9.1 Basel III Advanced Approaches (a) Fully implemented common equity tier 1 capital ratio (a) 11.5 11.6 (b) 11.8 (b) 11.7 (b) 11.5 (b) Tangible common equity to tangible assets (b) 7.7 7.6 7.7 7.5 7.6 Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets (b) 9.3 9.4 9.5 9.4 9.4 Common equity tier 1 capital ratio calculated under the transitional standardized approach (a)\n-- 9.3 9.6 9.5 9.5 Common equity tier 1 capital ratio calculated under the transitional advanced approaches (a)\n-- 12.0 12.1 12.0 11.8 (a) Beginning January 1, 2018, the regulatory capital requirements fully reflect implementation of Basel III. Prior to 2018, the Company's capital ratios reflected certain transitional adjustments. Basel III includes two comprehensive methodologies for calculating risk-weighted assets: a general standardized approach and more risk-sensitive advanced approaches, with the Company's capital adequacy being evaluated against the methodology that is most restrictive.\n(b) See Non-GAAP Financial Measures reconciliation on page 16 Total U.S. Bancorp shareholders’ equity was $49.2 billion at March 31, 2018, compared with $49.0 billion at December 31, 2017, and $47.8 billion at March 31, 2017. During the first quarter, the Company returned 68 percent of earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.\nAll regulatory ratios continue to be in excess of “well-capitalized” requirements. The common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio using the Basel III standardized approach was 9.0 percent at March 31, 2018, compared with 9.3 percent at December 31, 2017, and 9.5 percent at March 31, 2017. The common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio using the Basel III advanced approaches method was 11.5 percent at March 31, 2018, compared with 12.0 percent at December 31, 2017, and 11.8 percent at March 31, 2017.\nInvestor Conference Call\nOn Wednesday, April 18, 2018, at 8:00 a.m. CDT, Andy Cecere, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Terry Dolan, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, will host a conference call to review the financial results.

Statements that are not historical or current facts, including statements about beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements and are based on the information available to, and assumptions and estimates made by, management as of the date hereof. These forward-looking statements cover, among other things, anticipated future revenue and expenses and the future plans and prospects of U.S. Bancorp. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. A reversal or slowing of the current economic recovery or another severe contraction could adversely affect U.S. Bancorp’s revenues and the values of its assets and liabilities. Global financial markets could experience a recurrence of significant turbulence, which could reduce the availability of funding to certain financial institutions and lead to a tightening of credit, a reduction of business activity, and increased market volatility. Stress in the commercial real estate markets, as well as a downturn in the residential real estate markets could cause credit losses and deterioration in asset values. In addition, changes to statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies or practices could affect U.S. Bancorp in substantial and unpredictable ways. U.S. Bancorp’s results could also be adversely affected by deterioration in general business and economic conditions; changes in interest rates; deterioration in the credit quality of its loan portfolios or in the value of the collateral securing those loans; deterioration in the value of its investment securities; legal and regulatory developments; litigation; increased competition from both banks and non-banks; changes in customer behavior and preferences; breaches in data security; effects of mergers and acquisitions and related integration; effects of critical accounting policies and judgments; and management’s ability to effectively manage credit risk, market risk, operational risk, compliance risk, strategic risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and reputational risk.\nFor discussion of these and other risks that could cause actual results to differ from expectations, refer to U.S. Bancorp’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the sections entitled “Corporate Risk Profile” and “Risk Factors” contained in Exhibit 13, and all subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission under Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. However, factors other than these also could adversely affect U.S. Bancorp’s results, and the reader should not consider these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof, and U.S. Bancorp undertakes no obligation to update them in light of new information or future events.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including:\nTangible common equity to tangible assets Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets Return on tangible common equity\nThese capital measures are viewed by management as useful additional methods of evaluating the Company’s utilization of its capital held and the level of capital available to withstand unexpected negative market or economic conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures allows investors, analysts and banking regulators to assess the Company’s capital position relative to other financial services companies. These capital measures are not defined in generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) or are not defined in federal banking regulations. As a result, these capital measures disclosed by the Company may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, certain capital measures related to prior periods are presented on the same basis as those in the current period. The effective capital ratios defined by banking regulations for these periods were subject to certain transitional provisions. Management believes this information helps investors assess trends in the Company’s capital adequacy.\nThe Company also discloses net interest income and related ratios and analysis on a taxable-equivalent basis, which may also be considered non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. In addition, certain performance measures, including the efficiency ratio and net interest margin utilize net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis.\nThere may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, the Company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this press release in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure. A table follows that shows the Company’s calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME (Dollars and Shares in Millions, Except Per Share Data) Three Months Ended
