    "text": "Published: Apr 23, 2018 7:35 a.m. ET Share \nUnusual opposition from within centrist majority Reuters French President Emmanuel Macron attends a ceremony Friday in Paris. \nBy Sam Schechner \nPARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron’s grip on power showed some weakness late Sunday when a group of lawmakers from his party abstained from voting on one of his government’s signature bills. \nFrance’s National Assembly approved legislation that would tighten immigration and asylum laws by doubling the time migrants can be detained, speeding their deportation and strengthening police powers to search illegal immigrants. But the vote exposed unusual opposition from within Macron’s large centrist majority, some of whose members have criticized the proposal as being too harsh on migrants. \nAfter floor debate that stretched until nearly 11 p.m. Sunday, the measure was approved with 228 votes in favor, 139 against and 24 abstentions. All of those who voted in favor came from Macron’s majority and other smaller centrist parties. But even after a last-minute effort to soften one provision, 14 members of Macron’s majority were among the abstainers — and one member voted against the legislation in a rare show of defiance. \nThe measure will now be sent to the Senate for consideration.",
