FILE PHOTO: Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir arrives to welcome South Sudan's President Salva Kiir Mayardit at Khartoum airport, Sudan November 1, 2017. REUTERS/Mohamed Nureldin Abdallah \nThe decision came in response to the calls from political parties and groups participating in the country’s ongoing national dialogue to grant detainees the opportunity to engage in the country’s political process, SUNA reported. \nThe news agency did not specify how many political prisoners the decision would affect or the names of any of those set to be released.
