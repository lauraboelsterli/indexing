    "text": "NEW YORK, April 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hudson Global, Inc. (Nasdaq:HSON) (“Hudson”), a leading global talent solutions company, today announced it has completed the sales of its recruitment and talent management operations in Europe and Asia Pacific to strategic buyers in three transactions. Hudson received total proceeds of $39.0 million in cash at closing, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. Net proceeds included $24.8 million for recruitment and talent management operations in Benelux, $7.7 million for the recruitment and talent management operations in the rest of Europe, and $6.4 million for the recruitment and talent management operations in Asia Pacific. European proceeds are lower than previous estimates due to higher borrowings in the U.K. All Hudson debt has been transferred to the buyers with the divestitures.\nGoing forward, the company will focus on its Recruitment Process Outsourcing (“RPO”) business in the Americas, Asia Pacific, and EMEA. Hudson has a deep history in this space going back over 18 years as one of the first RPO providers in the industry. Hudson RPO delivers professional talent solutions to large, long-term clients in multiple sectors with operations across the globe. In 2017, Hudson RPO delivered $60 million in revenue, $42 million in gross margin, and is expected to generate positive EBITDA and cash flow in 2018, before corporate overhead. As of December 31, 2017 based on pro forma financials after the divestitures, Hudson Global had $45.1 million of cash and no debt on its balance sheet.\nThe company intends to use proceeds from the transactions for investment in the RPO business, reduction in support staff costs, the company’s existing share repurchase program, and other corporate purposes.\nManagement Change\nThe company also announced that Jeffrey E. Eberwein has been appointed chief executive officer. Mr. Eberwein, who currently serves as chairman of the company’s board of directors, will succeed Stephen A. Nolan effective April 1. Richard K. Coleman, Jr., Hudson's chairman of the compensation committee, will become chairman of the board effective April 1. Prior to becoming Hudson’s CEO, Mr. Eberwein was CEO of Lone Star Value Management, LLC, an investment firm he founded in 2013.\n“After five years at Hudson and the successful completion of the strategic divestitures, I have resigned from my role as CEO and board member,” said Mr. Nolan. “I look forward to helping Jeff and the company with the transition and I wish the best to all Hudson employees, customers, and stakeholders.”\n\"Since Jeff joined Hudson’s board in 2014, he has set the strategic direction for the board and the company and implemented a series of changes to improve governance and enhance stockholder value. He has the strategic and financial experience and leadership skills to serve as our next CEO,\" said Mr. Coleman, chairman of Hudson’s board of directors. \"As the company focuses on its global RPO business, we have confidence that Jeff will drive performance and execution at Hudson and ensure we continue Hudson’s legacy of exceptional customer service.\"\n\"I look forward to continuing to work alongside Hudson's global leaders and talented, dedicated group of employees who are deeply committed to this company and the customers we serve,” said Mr. Eberwein. “As we continue to pursue our growth strategy, I am confident that we have the right team, tools, and services in place to continue meeting and exceeding our customers' expectations. I welcome the opportunity to work closely with our highly-experienced RPO operating leaders, including Lori Hock in the Americas, Kimberley Hubble in Asia Pacific, and Darren Lancaster in EMEA.\"\nColeman continued, \"On behalf of the board, I want to thank Stephen for his dedication and commitment to our company, customers, and employees over the past five years. During his tenure, Hudson executed numerous strategic transactions, reduced its cost base, and established a clear, focused path forward in RPO. We are grateful for Stephen's contributions and we wish him all the best.\"\nAbout Hudson Global\nHudson is a global talent solutions company with expertise in recruitment process outsourcing and managed services.
