    "text": "0 COMMENTS Photo: Morgan Pansing Shira Lenchewski Los Angeles \nGrowing up in San Francisco in the ’90s, the age of fat-free everything and drastic diets like Atkins, Shira Lenchewski, 32, assumed eating was about picking a lane. “I thought you could either enjoy food and not feel good in your own skin or give up the joys of eating delicious things and feel great about yourself,” she says. “It was so liberating when I realized that wasn’t the case.” After earning a master’s in clinical nutrition at NYU and completing a residency at Mount Sinai, Lenchewski opened a private practice in New York City, then moved her office to L.A. in 2014. (Mandy Moore and Gwyneth Paltrow are both fans.) She soon noticed that the science of nutrition often took a backseat to her clients’ emotional issues. “The crux of my work would play out like a food therapy session,” she says. Lenchewski now focuses on untangling her clients’ relationships with eating and their bodies, an ethos that’s also at the heart of her new book, titled, fittingly, The Food Therapist. shirard.com \nPhoto: Susan Wood/Getty Images; Courtesy of Birkenstock; Courtesy of Block Shop; © A24/Courtesy of Everett Collection; Suthee Treewatanawong/Shutterstock; © aerolatte; John von Pamer; Aurora Photos/Offset/Shutterstock; F. Martin Ramin 1. What’s your favorite film? \nThis year I really loved Lady Bird. \n2. What’s your signature accessory? \nMy furry Birkenstocks. \n3. Are there any classic cookbooks you turn to? \nAlice Waters had the right idea all along. \n4. What’s a favorite recent discovery? \nI love Block Shop’s woodblock paper prints.\n5. What are your essential grooming products? \nI have sensitive skin, so everything I use is fragrance-free and as clean as possible. CAP Beauty is an incredible resource.\n6. What’s your favorite gadget? \nI’m obsessed with the Aerolatte frother for matcha and nut-milk foams.\n7. What’s the most important take-away from your new book? \nThe more self-knowledge we have about our personal hang-ups with food, the better we can be at moving through them.\n8. What travel destination do you find offers the best options for a healthy escape? \nThe absolute best for me was New Zealand. I found that there was just a different level of commitment to wellness there.\nPhoto: Mark Seliger Frank Lipman New York \nIn the wellness world, Frank Lipman, 63, would be considered a first-waver. Originally from South Africa, Dr. Lipman emigrated to the U.S. in 1984 to practice internal medicine at New York’s Lincoln Hospital, where he began to discover the limitations of his field. “My training was wonderful for the 15 percent of my patients who were acutely ill, but [I found] that the majority are not taken care of by Western medicine. So I started to explore other modalities,” he explains. In 1992, Lipman opened Eleven Eleven Wellness Center, where acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine and meditation are part of patient protocol, and in 2010, he launched Be Well, a collection of supplements. Along the way he has amassed a coterie of celebrity devotees—Michelle Williams, Sienna Miller and Arianna Huffington among them. Lipman’s latest book, How to Be Well , is a compendium of advice on all aspects of wellness, a topic Lipman is thrilled to see come to the fore. “The biggest shift is I’ve gone from being a quack to a guru,” he jokes. bewell.com \nPhoto: EyeBrowz/Alamy Stock Photo; Kerry and Luis/Offset/Shutterstock; Jack Robinson/Getty Images; Ricardo D’Angelo/Netflix; Jordi Huisman/Offset/Shutterstock; Randy Duchaine/Alamy Stock Photo; Courtesy of Rancho La Puerta; courtesy of Vitamix; Courtesy of Frank Lipman, M.D./Houghton Mifflin Harcourt; Paul Sirisalee/Offset/Shutterstock 1. Who are your favorite artists? \nWilliam Kentridge, whose work is often a commentary on apartheid; Barbara Jackson, the late South African ceramic artist; and for music, Bob Marley, Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen [shown].\n2. What travel destination do you find offers the best options for a healthy escape? \nCape Town, South Africa.\n3. What music do you like to listen to? \nI’m a huge music fan. I listen to Bob Marley when I want to relax and to some of my huge world music collection with up-tempo beats when I want to revitalize. \n4. What museum do you most like to visit? \nNew York’s Museum of Modern Art. \n5. What’s your current TV show obsession? \nChef’s Table [shown] and The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, especially his monologues. \n6. When you need to get away, where do you go? \nThe beach or anywhere I can be in nature.\n7. What’s your most important gadget? \nMy Vitamix blender.\n8. What’s your favorite food? \nA grass-fed and -finished steak.\n9. What’s the most important take-away from your new book? \nIt’s a simple manual built on what has always been the foundation of my practice: When it comes to good health, it’s about the choices we make on a daily basis. I feel passionately that if people take responsibility, they can make a huge difference in their own health with proper guidance and information.\n10. What hotel or resort do you find to be the most restorative? \nRancho La Puerta, in Tecate, Mexico.\nPhoto: Andreas Lind/CAMERALINK Food Pharmacy Lina Nertby Aurell and Mia Clase, both 40, like to say that it took them almost 25 years to understand the real reason they became friends as teens in Gothenburg, Sweden: so that they could eventually work together. In 2014, they both abandoned their careers—Aurell was a trade promoter, Clase an advertising creative director—and joined forces to launch Food Pharmacy, a Stockholm-based health blog focused on inflammation and the digestive system. Their career shift was prompted by the cancer deaths of three people close to them. “We’ve both always been hypochondriacs,” says Clase, “but after that we started investigating what we could do to live healthier.”\nClase’s father connected the pair with Stig Bengmark, a professor of medicine who studies intestinal health, and Food Pharmacy was born shortly thereafter. The pair’s philosophy, espoused both on their blog and in their new book, Food Pharmacy: A Guide to Gut Bacteria, Anti-Inflammatory Foods, and Eating for Health , is that rehabbing your gut flora is about adding key ingredients into your diet to help good bacteria propagate. “Focus on adding healthy stuff on a daily basis, instead of excluding things you like,” says Clase. foodpharmacy.blog \nPhoto: Topseller/Shutterstock; Africa Studio/Shutterstock; Ronald Dumont/Getty Images; Johnér/Offset/Shutterstock; F.

What’s the most important take-away from your new book? \nLNA: With a sense of humor and a little help, changing your eating habits can be both easy and fun.\n3.

I really like Roald Dahl [shown] and Frances Hodgson Burnett.\nLNA: I’m totally hooked on the excellent Swedish author Fredrik Backman.\nMore from WSJ.
