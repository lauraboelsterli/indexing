Frontal view of the Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport concept SUV as it is presented at the New York Auto Show in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., March 28, 2018. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton \nAs part of what could be the biggest shake-up at Volkswagen in a decade, Chief Executive Matthias Mueller is due to be replaced by Herbert Diess, head of VW’s core autos brand, who has repeatedly clashed with unions over cost cuts. \nVolkswagen announced the CEO change on Tuesday in a short and cryptic statement, abruptly ending the reign of Mueller who took over at VW a week after it was plunged into its biggest-ever corporate scandal. \nOther changes before the board include a public stock market listing of VW’s truck and bus division, a management board seat for a labour representative and a reorganisation of its 12 brands into four categories, sources said.
