    "text": "April 25, 2018 / 1:35 PM / Updated an hour ago Pakistani police exhume Italian woman over suspected 'honour killing' Mubasher Bukhari 2 Min Read\nLAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistani police exhumed the body of an Italian woman of Pakistani descent on Wednesday to investigate suspicion her family killed her in the name of so-called honour after she refused to marry a man of their choosing.\nSana Cheema, 25, who lived in Brescia, Italy, was visiting relatives in Pakistan this month when her family says she died after suffering from “chronic ulcer and hypotension”, said police official Asad Gujjar.\nSocial media activists in Pakistan highlighted the case this week, citing Italian media reports that Cheema might have been killed by her family after she refused to marry the man they wanted her to.\n“Police have taken samples from her stomach and sent them for forensic examination,” Gujjar said. He said there were no apparent injury marks on her body.\nCheema’s father and some relatives had been summoned for police questioning, he said, adding that no arrest had been made.\nThe family could not be reached for comment and no immediate comment was available from the Italian embassy.\nHundreds of women and girls are killed each year in Pakistan at the hands of family members over perceived damage to “honour” that can involve eloping, fraternizing with men or any other infraction against conservative values relating to women, rights groups say.\nParliament passed legislation against “honour killings” in 2016, introducing tough punishment and removing a loophole in the law that allowed killers to walk free if pardoned by family members.\nPolice in Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous province, said recently the number of cases of honour killing had fallen since the law was introduced.
