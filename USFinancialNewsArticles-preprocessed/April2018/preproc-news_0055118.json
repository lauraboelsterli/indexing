    "text": "Achieved Quarterly Revenue Growth Despite Industry Headwinds\nReaffirms 2018 Guidance\nNORTHVILLE, Mich., April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gentherm (NASDAQ:THRM), the global market leader and developer of innovative thermal management technologies, today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Key Takeaways\nProduct revenues of $261.9 million increased 5.1% from $249.3 million in the first quarter of 2017 Added $15.2 million in revenue associated with acquisition of Etratech; on a pro-forma basis, Etratech grew 20% from the comparable prior-year period Earnings per share was $0.35 as compared to $0.69 for the prior period Adjusted earnings per share, excluding unrealized currency losses, expenses and other impacts related to acquisitions (see table herein), was $0.50. Adjusted earnings per share in the prior-year period was $0.77 Secured record automotive new business awards totaling $375 million in the quarter, of which 50% represents CCS™ Market introduction of the industry’s first thermoelectric-based battery thermal management solution on 48-volt Mercedes S-500 EQ-Boost Full-year financial guidance reaffirmed\n\"Our first quarter results reflect challenging market conditions, especially in the North America automotive market. Nonetheless, I am pleased to see many areas of growth and we are gaining momentum on market launches, including our industry-first solution for the 48-volt lithium-ion battery thermal management with Daimler AG. We continue to lead the industry in innovative thermal management solutions, securing over $375 million of new awards in the quarter from top auto makers around the world,\" said Phil Eyler, the company's President and CEO.\nContinued Eyler, \"We are making good progress towards refining our strategy for accelerated revenue and earnings growth through focused investment and strong execution. In addition, we are taking decisive steps and have kicked off a formal program to identify areas where cost savings can be achieved without impacting our growth plan. With expected new program and product launches, along with vehicle production forecasted to improve in our most important markets over the balance of 2018, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our full-year financial guidance.\"\n2018 First Quarter Financial Review\nProduct revenues for the first quarter of 2018 grew by $12.6 million, or 5.1%, as compared to the prior-year, to $261.9 million. The year-over-year growth was comprised of an $18.2 million, or 8.2%, increase in the automotive segment and a $5.6 million, or 20%, decrease in the industrial segment. On a comparable basis, adjusting both periods for acquisitions and foreign currency translation, product revenues decreased 4.1% year over year.\nRevenue growth in Automotive was driven by a $15.2 million contribution from the acquisition of Etratech and favorable currency translation. Organically, automotive segment revenue was down 2.2%. Revenue was higher in all products, on a currency-adjusted basis, except climate controlled seats (“CCS”). The lower CCS revenue was primarily due to the 2.6% decline in overall North American vehicle production, with even greater declines for two of the Company’s largest customers, which had a disproportionate effect on CCS, as well as the continuing impact of the transition from the higher-priced active cool seat technology to the lower-priced heated and ventilated technology. The Company expects the downward trend in CCS to reverse going forward, resulting in a sequential improvement in the second quarter, as higher volume from new product launches and the anticipated increase in North American vehicle production begin to offset the effect of lower prices on platforms that have switched technologies.\nThe revenue decline in the Industrial segment, as compared to the prior-year period, resulted from significantly lower custom project revenue in the remote power generation business due to timing of shipments on customer projects, as well as lower year-over-year sales in the Cincinnati Sub-Zero (“CSZ”) blood heater cooler product which had benefitted from a competitor’s shortfall in the year-ago period. See the “Revenue by Product Category” table enclosed herein for additional detail.\nGross margin rate declined to 30.0% in the current year period, as compared to 34.2% in the prior-year period, primarily as a result of timing differences between annual customer price decreases compared to supplier cost reductions; expenses associated with increased capacity for the new advanced battery thermal management product at the manufacturing facility in Macedonia and labor expense inflation at the Ukraine factory; changes in product mix; and higher expenses resulting from the translation of foreign currencies.\nNet research and development expenses of $23.3 million in the first quarter of 2018 rose $3.8 million, or 19.5%, year over year as the Company continued to invest in innovation in automotive interior thermal management devices, automotive cooled storage devices, battery thermal management devices, battery management systems, advanced automotive electronics solutions, medical thermal management devices and other potential products.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses of $34.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 increased $3.8 million, or 12.3%, versus the prior-year period. The 2018 period included $1.0 million in higher expenses related to currency translation and $1.8 million in expenses associated with the acquisition of Etratech.\nAs described more fully in the table included below, “Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA,” the Company recorded Adjusted EBITDA of $33.6 million during the first quarter of 2018 compared to $45.2 million in the prior year, a year-over-year decline of $11.6 million.\nIncome tax expense in the first quarter of 2018 was $3.0 million, as compared to $7.2 million in the prior-year period. For the first quarter of 2018, this represents an effective tax rate of 19%, as compared to 22% in the prior-year period. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 differed from the Federal statutory rate of 21%, primarily due to the impact of lower statutory rates for the Company’s subsidiaries operating in foreign jurisdictions offset by the international provisions from the U.S. tax reform, such as global intangible low-tax income (“GILTI”), enacted in December 2017.\nDuring the first quarter, the Company incurred a net foreign currency loss of $4.6 million, which included a net realized loss of $0.9 million and a net unrealized loss of $3.6 million. This unrealized loss was primarily the result of holding significant amounts of U.S. Dollar cash at the Company’s subsidiaries in Europe, as well as certain intercompany relationships between these European subsidiaries and the Company’s U.S.-based companies. In the prior-year period, the Company recognized a net foreign currency loss of $1.3 million, which primarily represented a net unrealized foreign currency loss also related to the Company’s cash held at its European subsidiaries and intercompany cash balances.\nEarnings per share for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.35 as compared to $0.69 for the prior-year period. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding unrealized currency loss, acquisition transaction expenses and other items (see table included below), was $0.50. Adjusted earnings per share in the prior-year period was $0.77 on a diluted basis.\nGuidance\nThe Company reaffirms the guidance initially provided on its year-end 2017 earnings call on February 20, 2018:\nProduct revenues is expected to grow between 8% and 10% to a range of $1.06 billion to $1.08 billion, reflecting 3% to 5% organic growth and the full-year contribution from Etratech, which was acquired in November 2017 Gross margin rate is expected to be between 30% and 32% Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately 15% of product revenues Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $50 million\nConference Call\nAs previously announced, Gentherm will conduct a conference call today at 8:00 AM Eastern Time to review these results.

The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, deferred financing cost amortization, transaction expenses, debt retirement expenses, unrealized currency gain or loss and unrealized revaluation of derivatives. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful measure of liquidity and the Company's ability to service debt because it provides a measure of cash available for such purposes. Management provides an Adjusted EBITDA measure so that investors will have the same financial information that management uses with the belief that it will assist investors in properly assessing the Company's performance on a period-over-period basis.\nThe term Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under GAAP, and is not a measure of operating income, operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and when assessing the Company's operating performance, investors should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation, or as a substitute for net income or other consolidated income statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Gentherm compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally.\nGENTHERM INCORPORATED\nACQUISITION TRANSACTION EXPENSES, PURCHASE ACCOUNTING IMPACTS\nAND OTHER EFFECTS\n(Unaudited and in thousands, except per share data) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, Future Full Year Periods (estimated) 2018 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Thereafter Non-cash purchase accounting impacts Customer relationships amortization 2,665 1,887 10,660 8,392 7,032 6,451 28,456 Technology amortization 998 864 3,008 2,419 2,419 2,192 2,577 Inventory value adjustment 30 – 118 39 – – – Trade name amortization – 40 – – – – – Other effects Unrealized currency loss 3,642 1,345 – – – – – Total acquisition transaction expenses, purchase accounting impacts and other effects $\n7,335\n$ 4,139 $ 13,786 $ 10,850 $ 9,451 $ 8,643 $ 31,033 Tax effect of above (1,916 ) (1,056 ) (2,482 ) (1,820 ) (1,505 ) (1,310 ) (4,234 ) Net income effect $ 5,419 $ 3,085 $ 11,304 $ 9,030 $ 7,946 $ 7,333 $ 26,799 Earnings per share - difference Basic $ 0.15 $ 0.08 Diluted $ 0.15 $ 0.08 Adjusted earnings per share Basic $ 0.50 $ 0.78 Diluted $ 0.50 $ 0.77\nGENTHERM INCORPORATED\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In thousands, except share data)\n(Unaudited) March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 ASSETS Current Assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 70,482 $ 103,172 Accounts receivable, less allowance of $1,042 and $973, respectively 196,616 185,058 Inventory: Raw materials 64,871 64,175 Work in process 13,807 16,139 Finished goods 41,959 41,095 Inventory, net 120,637 121,409 Derivative financial instruments 1,168 213 Prepaid expenses and other assets 56,848 51,217 Total current assets 445,751 461,069 Property and equipment, net 205,232 200,294 Goodwill 70,439 69,685 Other intangible assets, net 80,809 83,286 Deferred financing costs 875 936 Deferred income tax assets 84,946 30,152 Other non-current assets 13,371 37,983 Total assets $ 901,423 $ 883,405 LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY Current Liabilities: Accounts payable $ 88,087 $ 89,596 Accrued liabilities 77,908 77,209 Current maturities of long-term debt 3,485 3,460 Derivative financial instruments 1 1,050 Total current liabilities 164,481 171,315 Pension benefit obligation 7,965 7,913 Other liabilities 6,759 2,747 Long-term debt, less current maturities 105,742 141,209 Deferred income tax liabilities 6,028 6,347 Total liabilities 290,975 329,531 Shareholders’ equity: Common Stock: No par value; 55,000,000 shares authorized, 36,794,573 and 36,761,362 issued and outstanding at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively 266,812 265,048 Paid-in capital 16,155 15,625 Accumulated other comprehensive loss (7,551 ) (20,444 ) Accumulated earnings 335,032 293,645 Total shareholders’ equity 610,448 553,874 Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity $ 901,423 $ 883,405\nGENTHERM INCORPORATED\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(In thousands)\n(Unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Operating Activities: Net income $ 12,966 $ 25,402 Adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities: Depreciation and amortization 12,892 10,192 Deferred income taxes (707 ) 676 Stock compensation 2,202 2,303 Defined benefit plan (income) expense 298 (16 ) Provision of doubtful accounts 41 (54 ) Loss on sale of property and equipment 85 103 Changes in operating assets and liabilities: Accounts receivable (9,691 ) (13,900 ) Inventory 1,903 (2,407 ) Prepaid expenses and other assets (4,881 ) (6,492 ) Accounts payable 1,290 1,094 Accrued liabilities (10,808 ) (38,237 ) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 5,590 (21,336 ) Investing Activities: Final payment for acquisition of subsidiary, net of cash acquired (15 ) (2,000 ) Purchases of property and equipment (8,378 ) (13,552 ) Net cash used in investing activities (8,393 ) (15,552 ) Financing Activities: Repayments of debt (35,492 ) (8,427 ) Cash paid for the cancellation of restricted stock (659 ) (926 ) Proceeds from the exercise of Common Stock options 751 881 Net cash used in financing activities (35,400 ) (8,472 ) Foreign currency effect 5,513 2,080 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 32,690 (43,280 ) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 103,172 177,187 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 70,482 $ 133,907 Supplemental disclosure of cash flow information: Cash paid for taxes $ 6,870 $ 51,618 Cash paid for interest $ 981 $ 858 Supplemental disclosure of non-cash transactions: Common Stock issued to Board of Directors and employees $ 1,362 $ 1,125\nSource:Gentherm Inc.",
