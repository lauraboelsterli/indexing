(NASDAQ:OHRP) who purchased shares between June 24, 2014 and January 4, 2018. The action, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that the Company violated federal securities laws.\nIn particular, the complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that (1) Ohr’s lead product Squalamine would not produce vision improvements and was commercially not viable; and (2) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ statements about Ohr’s business, operations, and prospects were misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.\nShareholders have until April 16, 2018 to petition the court for lead plaintiff status.
