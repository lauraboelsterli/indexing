    "text": "Top News \nZuckerberg Testimony \nHow good was Mark Zuckerberg’s performance before Congress yesterday? Reviews are mixed, but it was certainly good enough to boost Facebook’s stock price by 4.5% over the period of Zuck’s appearance. That means the Facebook CEO got $3 billion richer through a session in which he told Lindsey Graham that the social network has “a lot of competitors,” patiently explained to Orrin Hatch that Facebook makes its money through advertising, and endured John Kennedy telling him that “your user agreement sucks.” Fortune \nChinese Openness \nChina’s central bank has elaborated on the country’s plans for opening up its financial sector. From the start of next month, the daily Shanghai-Hong Kong stock connect quota will quadruple. Further measures will be in place by the end of June. “I think that the Chinese philosophy is gradualism,” said People’s Bank of China governor Yi Gang. “I’ll be very cautious.” Bloomberg \nLagarde Warning \nIMF chief Christine Lagarde says the system of globalization is “in danger of being torn apart,” an event she said would be “an inexcusable, collective policy failure.” Lagarde’s big concern is, of course, the strong possibility of a trade war resulting from U.S. President Donald Trump’s threatened imposition of tariffs on China and other countries. According to the European Central Bank, changes in tariffs could shrink global trade by up to 3%. CNBC \nIran Currency \nIran’s government has fixed the exchange rate of the national currency, after it lost 20% against the dollar in two weeks. The rate is now 42,000 rials to the dollar—the official rate had previously been 37,000, but traders were using a rate of 60,000 rials to the dollar. “Anyone trading at any other rate [than 42,000] will be considered a smuggler,” said Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri. BBC Advertisement Around the Water Cooler \nCargo Hold Beds \nAirbus plans to put sleeping facilities for passengers in the cargo holds of its A330 planes. The compartments would be “easily interchangeable with regular cargo containers,” the European company said. “This approach to commercial air travel is a step change towards passenger comfort,” said Airbus’s cabin and cargo chief Geoff Pinner. Guardian \nSports Rights Raids \nThe European Commission yesterday conducted raids of several sports media rights companies, including the London offices of Fox Networks Group, part of 21st Century Fox. The raids could presage charges of anti-competitive practices, though that is not necessarily the case. The commission’s officials were aided by national competition regulators. Financial Times \nSubprime Time \nOne of the biggest causes of the financial crisis was the rise in subprime loans. As the Wall Street Journal reports, the likes of Wells Fargo and Citigroup no longer make such loans—but they are lending money to operations such as Exeter Finance, which do grant loans to people with poor credit scores. And they’re financing these direct lenders for that very purpose. WSJ \nTrump and Mueller \nAfter the White House confirmed that President Trump definitely believes he has the power to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, senators such as Chuck Grassley and Bob Corker weighed in to assert that such a move would be, respectively, “suicide” and “inappropriate.”“It would be the beginning of the end of his presidency,” said Lindsey Graham.
