    "text": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg only made a salary of $1 in 2017, but his company spent close to $9 million for his personal security and use of private jets.\nAccording to a proxy statement released on Friday, Zuckerberg's \"other compensation\" jumped 53 percent last year from 2016 to $8.9 million. That figure includes $7.3 million for security at his home and during travel and $1.5 million \"for costs related to personal usage of private aircraft.\"\n\"Because of the high visibility of our company, our compensation & governance committee has authorized an 'overall security program' for Mr. Zuckerberg to address safety concerns due to specific threats to his safety arising directly as a result of his position as our founder, Chairman, and CEO,\" the filing said.\nshow chapters Here are the 6 best exchanges from Mark Zuckerberg's testimony before Congress 9:37 PM ET Wed, 11 April 2018 | 02:02 Zuckerberg is sometimes accompanied by others when traveling by private aircraft.\nCOO Sheryl Sandberg also has an authorized security program, according to the filing. Sandberg's \"other compensation\" amounted to $2.7 million last year.\n\"We require these security measures for the company's benefit because of the importance of Ms. Sandberg to Facebook,\" the filing said.\nZuckerberg received a salary of just $1 last year, without bonuses or stock awards. Not that he needs the money. The Facebook co-founder owns shares in the social network valued at about $66 billion.\nWATCH: FB data issue may apply to other tech companies show chapters Afraid that Facebook data issue may also apply to other tech companies: EU 9:54 AM ET Fri, 13 April 2018 | 01:55 ",
