A rainbow is seen over a pumpjack during sunset outside Scheibenhard, near Strasbourg, France, October 6, 2017. REUTERS/Christian Hartmann \nU.S. WTI crude futures CLc1 were at $62.24 a barrel at 0230 GMT, up 18 cents, or 0.3 percent, from their previous settlement. \nBrent crude futures LCOc1 were at $67.33 per barrel, up 22 cents, or 0.3 percent. \nOil prices fell about 2 percent on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs on China, reigniting fears of a trade war between the world’s two largest economies that could hurt global growth. \nWith Chinese markets closed last Thursday and Friday, Shanghai crude futures ISCc1 played catch-up on Monday, dropping 0.6 percent to around 400 yuan ($63.43) per barrel. \n“While it’s possible an escalating trade war could dent global growth sentiment, the real fear is that China, if pushed hard enough, could slap a tax on U.S. oil imported into China,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia/Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore. \nBeyond crude prices, analysts said an extended trade spat between China and the United States would also hurt oil servicing companies, which have only recently started recovering from years of crisis as the industry deferred spending on new production due to low prices. \n“For an oil and gas industry looking to rebound in a higher oil price environment, these tariffs necessitate monitoring. More specifically, oilfield service companies must now take pause,” said Matthew Fitzsimmons, vice president for oilfield service research at consultancy Rystad Energy. \nIn physical oil markets, OPEC’s number two producer Iraq said on Monday that it is keeping prices for its crude supplies in May steady. \nIn the United States, drillers added 11 rigs looking for new production in the week to April 6, bringing the total count to 808, the highest level since March 2015, General Electric’s ( GE.N ) Baker Hughes energy services firm said on Friday. \nAs a result, U.S. exports have soared in recent months, “more than offsetting the Venezuelan supply disruption” as a result of the economic crisis in the South American OPEC-member, Innes said. \nDespite this, oil prices have generally been supported by healthy demand as well as by supply restraint led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which started in 2017 in order to rein in oversupply and prop up prices. \nGraphic on U.S. versus China tariffs: tmsnrt.rs/2GXE9qr Reporting by Henning Gloystein; editing by Richard Pullin",
