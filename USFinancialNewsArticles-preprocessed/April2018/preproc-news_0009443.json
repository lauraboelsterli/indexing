Hindalco led gains on the NSE index, rising as much as 6.2 percent, and was set to snap four sessions of losses.\nVedanta Ltd gained over 5 percent, while Tata Steel Ltd was up as much as 3.8 percent.\nBanking stocks rose ahead of a monetary policy decision by the country’s central bank later in the day, where it is expected to hold interest rates steady.\n“The possibilities of a negative or positive surprise in the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) policy are limited. Outlook on growth, inflation and the way RBI perceives the developments abroad will be important to watch out for,” Jasani said.\nThe Nifty bank index gained as much as 1.6 percent, with State Bank of India and ICICI Bank Ltd up more than 2 percent each.\nReporting by Jessica Kuruthukulangara in Bengaluru; Editing by Biju Dwarakanath\n ",
