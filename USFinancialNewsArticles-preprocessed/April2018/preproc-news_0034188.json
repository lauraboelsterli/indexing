    "text": "April 19, 2018 / 8:09 PM / Updated 8 minutes ago Rosenstein told Trump last week he's not a target in Russia probe: Bloomberg Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told President Donald Trump last week that he is not a target of any part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday. U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein speaks at a news conference with other law enforcement officials at the Justice Department to announce nine Iranians charged with conducting massive cyber theft campaign, in Washington, U.S., March 23, 2018. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas \nCiting two unnamed sources, Bloomberg said Rosenstein brought up the matter and offered the reassurance in a meeting with Trump at the White House last Thursday, and that the development “helped tamp down the president’s desire to remove Rosenstein or Mueller.” Reporting by Tim Ahmann; Writing by Mohammad Zargham; Editing by Eric Beech",
