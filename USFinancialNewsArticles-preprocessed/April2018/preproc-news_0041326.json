The securities offered by the Company consist of Units consisting of one share of our Series 4 Convertible Preferred Stock, each convertible into shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase such number of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of a share of Series 4 Convertible Preferred Stock at the conversion price.\nInpixon’s common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “INPX.” The Company is conducting the offering in order to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1), which requires that listed companies maintain a minimum of $2.5 million in stockholders’ equity. The Company expects to use the net proceeds of the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes (including research and development and sales and marketing and the satisfaction of outstanding amounts payable to our vendors in connection with trade payables) and transaction expenses.\nRoth Capital Partners is acting as the sole placement agent for the offering on a “best efforts” basis.\nThe securities are being offered pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3, as amended (File No. 333-204159), that was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and declared effective on May 28, 2015. The securities may be offered only by means of a prospectus. A preliminary prospectus supplement relating to and describing the terms of the offering has been filed with the SEC and is available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and may also be obtained from Roth Capital Partners at 888 San Clemente Drive, Suite 400, Newport Beach, CA 92660, (800) 678-9147.\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.
