In turn, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average returned just under 1 percent to investors in such instances. On Wednesday the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA) rose half a percent while the S&P 500 declined 0.3 percent.

Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and 'smart!' You shouldn't be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!\" Tweet \nInterestingly enough, crude has not acted predictably after U.S. interventions in the Middle East. \nWest Texas Intermediate futures post an average decline of 0.2 percent one month after a U.S. operation in the region starts, according to Kensho. U.S. crude rose 2.4 percent on Wednesday.
