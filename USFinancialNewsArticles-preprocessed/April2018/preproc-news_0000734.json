    "text": "WILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Rigrodsky & Long, P.A.:\nDo you, or did you, own shares of TrueCar, Inc. (NASDAQ GS: TRUE )? Did you purchase your shares between February 16, 2017 and November 6, 2017, inclusive? Did you lose money in your investment?\nRigrodsky & Long, P.A. announces that a complaint has been filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California on behalf of all persons or entities that purchased the common stock of TrueCar, Inc. (“TrueCar” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ GS: TRUE ) between February 16, 2017 and November 6, 2017, inclusive (the “Class Period”), alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 against the Company and certain of its officers (the “Complaint”).\nIf you purchased shares of TrueCar during the Class Period, or purchased shares prior to the Class Period and still hold TrueCar, and wish to discuss this action or have any questions concerning this notice or your rights or interests, please contact Seth D. Rigrodsky or Timothy J. MacFall at Rigrodsky & Long, P.A., 300 Delaware Avenue, Suite 1220, Wilmington, Delaware 19801, by telephone at (888) 969-4242, or by e-mail at info@rl-legal.com .\nThe Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements, and omitted materially adverse facts, about the Company’s business, operations and prospects. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that the defendants concealed from the investing public that: (1) that the United Services Automobile Association (“USAA”) had been planning significant changes to its website that would have a material adverse effect on the volume of purchases generated by USAA; (2) that USAA made significant changes to its website that would have a material adverse effect on the volume of purchases generated by USAA; (3) that the changes to USAA's website maintained by TrueCar caused a material adverse effect on the volume of purchases generated by USAA; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' statements about TrueCar's business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and/or misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. As a result of defendants’ alleged false and misleading statements, the Company’s stock traded at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period.\nAccording to the Complaint, on November 6, the Company disclosed that USAA had made significant changes to its website during the Class period that had a material adverse effect on the volume of purchases generated by USAA.\nOn this news, shares of TrueCar declined over 35%, closing at $10.58 per share on November 7, 2015, on heavy trading volume.\nIf you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than June 1, 2018 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. Any member of the proposed class may move the court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.\nAttorney advertising. Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180402005939/en/\nRigrodsky & Long, P.A.\nTimothy J. MacFall, Esquire\nPeter Allocco\n888-969-4242\n516-683-3516\nFax: 302-654-7530\ninfo@rl-legal.com\nhttp://www.rigrodskylong.com\nSource: Rigrodsky & Long, P.A.",
