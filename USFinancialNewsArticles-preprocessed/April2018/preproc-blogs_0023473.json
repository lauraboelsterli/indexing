While traditional computers use binary digits, or bits, which can either be 0s or 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, which can represent and store information in both 0s and 1s simultaneously.\nA widely used encryption algorithm called RSA is among those particularly at risk when a large-scale quantum computer does come to market.\nCisco has been researching new types of algorithms that could protect against a quantum computing attack for about five years, Mr. Kampanakis said. “We’re trying to take the next step and introduce these algorithms into real-world protocols now, in order to make them usable,” he said. “We don’t want to wait 15 years. We want to be prepared and be ready for when that time comes.”\nIn partnership with Isara, Cisco is developing a way for a single digital certificate to accommodate multiple algorithms that could thwart against attacks by both classical computers and quantum computers.\nDigital certificates act as a user or entity’s digital identity. They’re used to authenticate a user when they’re making an online purchase or logging into a human resources system at work, for example, said Michael Brown, chief technology officer at Isara.\nA user can see whether a particular website is trustworthy, for example, by clicking on the green lock icon in a web browser.\nToday, digital certificates have cryptographic keys based on traditional security algorithms such as RSA.\nThe RSA algorithm is particularly vulnerable when a powerful quantum computer comes to market because it’s based on integer factorization, which is essentially reverse multiplication.\nIt would take classical computers, even supercomputers, several years to quickly factor large numbers that are 500 or 600 digits long, which means solving for integer factorization is impractical and inefficient, experts have said previously . Quantum computers, though, are capable of solving integer factorization problems perhaps trillions of times faster than a classical computer.\nCisco is introducing digital certificates with cryptographic keys based on those algorithms in addition to so-called quantum resistant algorithms that could potentially thwart against a quantum computing attack.\nThe company made the new certificates available for companies and researchers to test this week. Any large-scale information technology upgrade will take years of planning to reduce the costs, complexity and potential burdens on user experience, so it’s important for companies to start testing and demanding standardized algorithms now, Mr. Brown said.\n“The reality is that this is going to involve updating all information and communications technology systems to be ‘quantum safe,’” he said.\n \nShare this: CISCO CYBERSECURITY ENCRYPTION ISARA QUANTUM COMPUTING Previous The Morning Download: Tyson CTO Rewiring 83-Year-Old Food Giant",
