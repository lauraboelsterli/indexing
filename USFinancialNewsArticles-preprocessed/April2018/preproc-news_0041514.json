Another Florentine brand, Gucci has been relaunched in recent years by owner Kering and has once again become a key contributor to the French luxury goods group’s sales.\nSources had told Reuters this week that the company wanted to set up an executive committee while it took more time to look for a CEO.\nSpeaking to reporters after Friday’s annual shareholder meeting, the chairman ruled out the possibility of a family member becoming CEO.\n“The new CEO must love and understand Ferragamo and I hope will come from within the company,” he said.\nThe Ferragamo family owns nearly 70 percent of the group.\nFerruccio Ferragamo has said he intends to hold the reins for as short a period as possible but that the group would take all the time needed to find the right CEO.\nThe company has not given reasons for the sudden exit of Poletto but Ferruccio Ferragamo said on Friday that there had been “divergences on certain points”.\nHe added that the group was pressing ahead with the plan presented in February last year “without changes or twists”.\n“I am satisfied,” he said but acknowledged that the company still needs to bolster its online business and compete better in a segment that has become one of the luxury sector’s main growth drivers.
