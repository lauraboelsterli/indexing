    "text": "UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia appealed to the United States on Tuesday to “refrain” from any action it might be planning against Syria over a suspected deadly chemical weapons attack.\nRussian Ambassador to the United Nations Vassily Nebenzia addresses the U.N. Security Council on Syria during a meeting of the Council at U.N. headquarters in New York, U.S., March 12, 2018. REUTERS/Mike Segar “The threats you are proffering that you’re stating vis-a-vis Syria should make us seriously worried, all of us, because we could find ourselves on the threshold of some very sad and serious events,” Nebenzia told U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley.\n“I would once again ask you, once again beseech you, to refrain from the plans that you’re currently developing for Syria,” he said after the council failed to approve a third draft resolution on chemical weapons attacks in Syria.\nReporting by Michelle Nichols; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ",
