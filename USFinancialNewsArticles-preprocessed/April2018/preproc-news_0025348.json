Average shares outstanding declined 7 percent as the company bought back stock. \nAnalysts on average had expected earnings per share of $1.61, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It was not immediately clear if the numbers were comparable. \nJPMorgan Chase & Co, the biggest bank by assets earlier on Friday reported a 35 percent jump in profit on lower taxes and higher interest rates.
