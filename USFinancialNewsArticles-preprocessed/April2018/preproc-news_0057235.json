(NasdaqGS: ENTG), a leader in specialty chemicals and advanced materials solutions for the microelectronics industry, today reported its financial results for the Company’s first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst-quarter sales were $367.2 million, an increase of 16% from the same quarter last year and a 5% increase sequentially. First-quarter net income was $57.6 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, which include $11.7 million of amortization of intangible assets, and a $1.5 million tax charge related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Non-GAAP net income was $68.0 million, or $0.47 per diluted share.\nBertrand Loy, president and chief executive officer, said: \"We are very pleased with our record results in the first quarter. We grew our revenue faster than our markets and expanded our profits faster than our top line growth -- both of which are key ongoing goals. Industry trends continue to be positive for Entegris, as the semiconductor industry's intersecting needs for new materials and increasing purity requirements are driving new market opportunities for our unique solutions set.\"\nMr. Loy added: \"We generated record quarterly adjusted EBITDA of $106 million, or 28.9% of revenue. Our strong operational execution supported the deployment of $104 million of capital in the quarter consistent with our strategy, which included capital investments to support future growth, an accretive acquisition, additional debt pay down, and our continued share repurchase and quarterly dividend programs.\"\nQuarterly Financial Results Summary\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nGAAP Results Q1-2018\nQ1-2017\nQ4-2017\nNet sales $367,199 $317,377 $350,562 Operating income $78,473 $50,920 $71,152 Operating margin 21.4% 16.0% 20.3% Net income (loss) $57,562 $32,514 $(28,341) Diluted earnings (loss) per share (EPS) $0.40 $0.23 $(0.20) Non-GAAP Results Non-GAAP adjusted operating income $90,142 $61,865 $82,172 Adjusted operating margin 24.5% 19.5% 23.4% Non-GAAP net income $68,015 $40,754 $59,694 Non-GAAP EPS $0.47 $0.28 $0.42 Second-Quarter Outlook\nFor the second quarter ending June 30, 2018, the Company expects sales of $370 million to $385 million, net income of $52 million to $59 million, and net income per diluted share between $0.36 and $0.41.

Entegris is ISO 9001 certified and has manufacturing, customer service and/or research facilities in the United States, China, France, Germany, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. Additional information can be found at www.entegris.com .\nNon-GAAP Information\nThe Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Segment Profit, and Adjusted Operating Income together with related measures thereof, and non-GAAP EPS, are considered “Non-GAAP financial measures” under the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making, as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons, as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring business operating results, such as amortization, depreciation and discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing and understanding our results and performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze our business. The reconciliations of GAAP Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted EBITDA, and GAAP Net Income (Loss) to Non-GAAP Earnings per Share are included elsewhere in this release.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
