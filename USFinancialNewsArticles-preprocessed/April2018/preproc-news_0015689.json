    "text": "2 COMMENTS KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia—Malaysia’s prime minister is promising higher cash handouts to almost half of the country’s population if his ruling coalition wins re-election next month, a move that offers the prospect of short-term stimulus, but risks long-term reliance on such payouts.\nMalaysians are set to go to the polls on May 9 , in a vote that will test whether Prime Minister Najib Razak can overcome the effects of the problems at state investment fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd., or 1MDB, that have rocked his administration for years.\nThe date of the vote, announced Tuesday, has been criticized by some members of the opposition. Malaysia generally holds elections on weekends, but this year’s vote will be held midweek. Wan Saiful Wan Jan, a member of an opposition party, said the choice of the polling day is an attempt by Mr. Najib and his party to suppress voter turnout.\nElection Commission Chairman Hashim Abdullah didn’t provide details on the polling date selection.\nNo recent polling has been done to test the relative strength of Mr. Najib’s National Front, or Barisan Nasional in Malay, which has governed Malaysia since independence in 1957.\nRelated \nMalaysia Heads for Election in Leader’s Biggest Test Since 1MDB Scandal Malaysia Suspends Opposition Party Ahead of Elections Malaysia’s New Electoral Map Favors Government Mr. Najib’s election manifesto includes doubling some cash handouts and adding new categories of recipients for this year. In front of a 40,000-strong crowd Saturday in the capital city of Kuala Lumpur, Najib said cash handouts for each household earning the equivalent of about $700 a month and below will be doubled to just over $200. Some higher-earning households and individuals would also get increased handouts. Among the new groups of recipients were some university students who would be given a payout of nearly $400.\nMalaysia introduced the cash-handout program in 2012 and the amount allocated has nearly quadrupled since then.\nKim Leng Yeah, professor of economics at Malaysia’s Sunway University Business School and an external member of the monetary-policy committee of Malaysia’s central bank, said the increase in cash handouts is one of the largest in the country’s history.\nHe estimates they will cost the government an additional 2.5 billion ringgit to 3 billion ringgit ($645.7 million to $774.9 million) or about 0.2% of gross domestic product projected for 2018. This is on top of the more than 6 billion ringgit the Malaysia government had initially allocated for the handouts. The inclusion of new categories will also expand the recipients’ base to close to half the population, from less than a quarter initially.\n“Theoretically, higher cash transfers will lead to higher aggregate consumption, and thus higher economic output and growth,” said Adli Amirullah, an economist with Institute of Democracy and Economic Affairs, a Malaysian think tank. However in the long run, people might become overly reliant on this assistance, which could threaten productivity, he said.\nHigher-than estimated oil prices will provide the Malaysian government the flexibility to increase spending without breaching the fiscal deficit target set for this year, said Sunway University’s Mr. Yeah. But the possible boost to economic growth from the handouts will do little to address the cost-of-living and low-wage challenges faced by the cash recipients.\n“The increased allocation reduces the buffer and flexibility of government to spend in the event revenue collection falls short of expectations or the economy falters,” said Mr. Yeah.\nMalaysia’s economy, Southeast Asia’s third largest, grew 5.9% last year from 4.2% a year earlier, helped by robust domestic demand and strong exports. Malaysia’s central bank, in its latest annual report issued last month, projected the economy to grow 5.5%-6.0% this year.\nThe escalating trade dispute between the U.S. and China could threaten that growth. Malaysia exports goods such as machine parts and components for communications equipment used in the production of items that China then sells to the U.S., Malaysia’s AmBank Research said. Moreover, China and the U.S. are Malaysia’s second and third top trading partners, respectively, after Singapore.\nWrite to Yantoultra Ngui at yantoultra.ngui@wsj.com \n\nCorrections & Amplifications \nPrime Minister Najib Razak’s ruling coalition is the National Front, or Barisan Nasional in Malay. An earlier version of this article misspelled the coalition’s name in Malay. (April 10, 2018)",
