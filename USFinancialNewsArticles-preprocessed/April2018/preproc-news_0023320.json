    "text": "BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Plymouth Industrial REIT, Inc. (NYSE American: PLYM) announced that it acquired two single-tenant Class B industrial buildings in the Chicago area totaling 270,000 square feet for $15.675 million in cash. The acquisition was funded with borrowings on the Company’s credit facility and is projected to provide an initial yield of 8.0%.\nThe 236,736-square-foot 1600 Fleetwood Drive in Elgin, Illinois is 100% leased to Stamar Packaging, a leading distributor of packaging, shipping and industrial supplies, until April 2027. The property is located in the North Kane County submarket, one of Chicago’s largest industrial markets, and has additional land for potential expansion. Three West College Drive in Arlington Heights, Illinois is 100% leased to Arrow Up, a provider of containerized bins for the blending of sand/silica used in the oil fracking industry and a subsidiary of one of the largest private railroad and transportation management companies in North America, until April 2022. The property is located in the Northwest Cook County submarket.\nJeff Witherell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Plymouth Industrial REIT, noted, “These highly functional buildings and their strong tenancy are excellent additions to our growing presence in Chicago. The buildings, tenant use and submarkets are consistent with our strategy of focusing on where industrial America is established with access to highly skilled labor.”\nPendleton White, Jr., President and Chief Investment Officer, added, “With both tenants headquartered in the greater Chicago area, we consider these buildings to be more mission critical in nature. The remaining lease terms provide stable cash flows with the ability to create value through annual rent increases or potential expansion in markets that have historically been targeted for ‘last-mile’ use or benefited from low vacancy and strong space absorption.”\nAbout Plymouth\nPlymouth Industrial REIT, Inc. is a vertically integrated and self-managed real estate investment trust focused on the acquisition and operation of single and multi-tenant industrial properties located in secondary and select primary markets across the United States. The Company seeks to acquire properties that provide income and growth that enable the Company to leverage its real estate operating expertise to enhance shareholder value through active asset management, prudent property re-positioning and disciplined capital deployment.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes “forward-looking statements” that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
