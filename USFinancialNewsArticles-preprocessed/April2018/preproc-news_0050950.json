    "text": "April 25, 2018 / 10:23 AM / in 2 minutes UPDATE 1-Health insurer Anthem tops profit estimates, raises forecast Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Adds Q1 details, forecast) \nApril 25 (Reuters) - Anthem Inc reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, largely due to lower medical costs, prompting the health insurer to raise its full-year profit forecast. \nAnthem’s net income rose 30 percent to $1.31 billion, or $4.99 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31. \nExcluding items, the company earned $5.41 per share, storming past analysts’ average estimate of $4.88, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nAnthem’s benefit expense ratio improved to 81.5 percent from 83.7 percent in the year-ago period. The metric measures an insurer’s expenditure on claims against the premiums it earns. \nThe decrease was primarily driven by the return of the health insurance tax in 2018 and improved medical cost performance across its businesses, the company said. \nTotal revenue was largely flat at $22.54 billion. \nThe insurer said it now expects 2018 adjusted net earnings to be greater than $15.30 per share, up from its previous estimate of earnings of greater than $15 per share.
