    "text": "FORT WORTH, Texas, April 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Higginbotham and Butler Carson Tate Insurance announced today the merger of their operations in Lubbock, Texas. This is Higginbotham's second office in Lubbock, having entered the market in 2015 when it merged with another locally managed independent insurance agency. The two offices and their combined 18 insurance and financial services professionals will work in unison to deliver a single source solution to west Texas businesses and families.\nHigginbotham is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, and ranked by revenue as the largest independent insurance broker based in the state. It operates 29 offices in Texas and Oklahoma City, most of which were established agencies that joined the firm to draw on their collective strength to service customers.\n\"Higginbotham's reputation as a Texas-centric firm resonated with me,\" said Butler Carson Tate Insurance President James Tate. \"It's a reputation I came to know through working on cases with Brent Aycock, who merged with Higginbotham a few years ago for similar reasons. We have the same dedication to protecting Texas businesses, supporting our employees and nurturing our community. Partnering with Higginbotham multiplies our ability to do all those things while staying personally involved with every customer we service.\"\nBrent Aycock, a managing director with Higginbotham in Lubbock, said, \"Our practice has taken off since joining Higginbotham because we can do so much more for our customers, from the range of coverage we offer to the risk management and employee benefit services we perform in-house. I expect further growth as a whole from teaming up with Butler Carson Tate Insurance and bringing Higginbotham's solution to even more customers.\"\nButler Carson Tate Insurance will expand services to include group life, health and disability plans by collaborating with employee benefits broker and Managing Director Jeff Fowler at Higginbotham in Lubbock.\nTate will continue supervising Butler Carson Tate Insurance as managing director with John Carson as vice president at 4505 82 nd Street. Higginbotham is located at 9816 Slide Road.\nAbout Butler Carson Tate Insurance\nButler Carson Tate opened in 1973 to broker business and personal property/casualty insurance in Lubbock, Texas.
