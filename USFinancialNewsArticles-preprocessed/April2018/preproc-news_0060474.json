(TSX:SMT, BVL:SMT) (\"Sierra Metals\" or the \"Company\") announces the filing of Sociedad Minera Corona S.A.'s (\"Corona\") unaudited Financial Statements and the Management Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&A\") for the first quarter of 2018 (\"Q1 2018\").\nThe Company holds an 81.8% interest in Corona. All amounts are presented in US dollars unless otherwise stated, and have not been adjusted for the 18.2% non-controlling interest.\nCorona's Highlights for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018\nRevenues of US$46.6 million vs. US$38.5 million in Q1 2017 Adjusted EBITDA of US$24.2 million vs. US$20.5 million in Q1 2017 Total tonnes processed of 271,389 vs. 251,180 in Q1 2017 Net production revenue per tonne of ore milled increased by 7% to US$168.74 Cash cost per zinc equivalent payable pound higher by 36% to US$0.57 All in sustaining cost (\"AISC\") per zinc equivalent payable pound higher by 34% to US$0.82 Zinc equivalent production of 34.8 million pounds vs. 38.1 million pounds in Q1 2017 $23.2 million of cash and cash equivalents as at March 31, 2018 $33.3 million of working capital as at March 31, 2018\n\"The Yauricocha Mine continued to be a strong performer in the first quarter of 2018\" stated Igor Gonzales, President, and CEO of Sierra Metals. \"The Mine reported a 21% increase in revenue, and an 18% increase in adjusted EBITDA over the same period in 2017, continuing to reap the benefits of the operational improvements program and improved realized metal prices. Additionally, an increase in the net production revenue per tonne of ore milled continues to demonstrate that the capital investments at the Mine were well spent. Cash and all-in sustaining costs, while higher year over year, remained in line with previous quarters.\nCorona continues to have a solid balance sheet, and strong liquidity, to meet its operational and growth expenditure requirements. Management is confident that further operational efficiencies and productivity improvements will be realized with the completion of key projects such as the Yauricocha tunnel expected in Q3 2018, in addition the sinking of the Yauricocha Shaft, which will provide access to a substantial amount of recently defined ore reserves and resources. Exploration also continues, and we look forward to further mineral discoveries and resource increases at the Mine.\"\nThe following table displays selected unaudited financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2018:\n(In thousands of US dollars, except cash cost and revenue\nper tonne metrics)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\nVar %\nRevenue\n$\n46,563\n38,501\n21%\nAdjusted EBITDA (1)\n24,225\n20,546\n18%\nCash Flow from operations\n24,081\n20,417\n18%\nGross profit\n25,220\n19,916\n27%\nIncome Tax Expense\n(7,414)\n(4,558)\n63%\nNet Income\n15,101\n11,882\n27%\nNet production revenue per tonne of ore milled (2)\n$\n168.74\n157.93\n7%\nCash cost per tonne of ore milled (2)\n63.04\n57.82\n9%\nCash cost per zinc equivalent payable pound (2)\n0.57\n0.42\n36%\nAll-In Sustaining Cost per zinc equivalent payable pound (2)\n0.82\n0.61\n34%\n(In thousands of US dollars, unless otherwise stated)\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n23,174\n19,908\nAssets\n148,702\n140,414\nLiabilities\n49,903\n50,844\nEquity\n98,799\n89,570\n1 Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments for depletion and depreciation, interest expense and other financing costs, interest income, share-based compensation, Foreign Exchange (gain) loss and income taxes; see non-IFRS Performance Measures section of the Company's MD&A.\n2 All-In Sustaining Cost per zinc equivalent pound sold are non-IFRS performance measures and include cost of sales, treatment and refining charges, sustaining capital expenditures, general and administrative expense, and selling expense, and exclude workers' profit sharing, depreciation, and other non-cash provisions; Cash cost zinc equivalent pound sold, net production revenue per tonne of ore milled, and cash cost per tonne of ore milled are non-IFRS performance measures; see non-IFRS Performance Measures section of the Company's MD&A.\nCorona's Financial Highlights for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018\nRevenues of $46.6 million for Q1 2018 increased by 21% compared to $38.5 million of revenues in Q1 2017. The increase in revenues during Q1 2018 was due to an 8% increase in tonnes processed, higher head grades for copper and gold, and higher recoveries for copper. Increases in the prices of copper (17%), zinc (23%), lead (11%), and gold (9%) also contributed to the revenue improvement. Cash cost per zinc equivalent pound sold at the Yauricocha Mine of $0.57 for Q1 2018 compared to $0.42 for Q1 2017 and all-in sustaining cost (\"AISC\") per zinc equivalent pound sold of $0.82 for Q1 2018 compared to $0.61 for Q1 2017. The increase in the AISC per zinc equivalent payable pound for Q1 2018 compared to Q1 2017 were a result of fewer zinc equivalent pounds sold, despite higher throughput due to lower head grades; as well as slight increases to administrative costs and operating costs which included infill drilling and drift development costs that will be utilized within one year, and thus are included in opex. Adjusted EBITDA of $24.2 million for Q1 2018 compared to $20.5 million for Q1 2017 and the increase in adjusted EBITDA for Q1 2018 was due to the increase in revenues discussed previously. Operating cash flows before movements in working capital of $24.1 million for Q1 2018, compared to US$20.4 million for Q1 2017, and the increase in operating cash flows before movements in working capital for Q1 2018 was primarily due to the increase in revenues, discussed previously. Cash and cash equivalents of $23.2 million as at March 31, 2018, compared to $19.9 million as at December 31, 2017. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $3.3 million which was driven by operating cash flows of $10.2 million, and $5.0 million being drawn from a short term revolving line of credit for working capital purposes, partially offset by capital expenditures of $5.3 million, debt and interest payments of $1.7 million, intercompany loans of $2.1 million, and dividends paid of $2.9 million. Net income of $15.1 million, or $0.42 per share for Q1 2018 compared to net income of $11.9 million, or $0.33 per share for Q1 2017.\nCorona's Operational Highlights for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018:\nThe following table displays the production results for the three months ended March 31, 2018:\nYauricocha Production\n3 Months Ended\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\n% Var.\nTonnes processed (mt)\n271,389\n251,180\n8%\nDaily throughput\n3,102\n2,871\n8%\nSilver grade (g/t)\n59.52\n81.37\n-27%\nCopper grade\n0.89%\n0.81%\n9%\nLead grade\n1.24%\n1.76%\n-29%\nZinc grade\n3.45%\n3.60%\n-4%\nGold Grade (g/t)\n0.61\n0.56\n9%\nSilver recovery\n70.50%\n75.95%\n-7%\nCopper recovery\n70.22%\n62.00%\n13%\nLead recovery\n81.51%\n85.96%\n-5%\nZinc recovery\n87.94%\n89.12%\n-1%\nGold Recovery\n15.77%\n17.25%\n-9%\nSilver ounces (000's)\n366\n499\n-27%\nCopper pounds (000's)\n3,727\n2,783\n34%\nLead pounds (000's)\n6,069\n8,382\n-28%\nZinc pounds (000's)\n18,144\n17,774\n2%\nGold ounces\n835\n779\n7%\nZinc equivalent pounds (000's) (1)\n34,767\n38,137\n-9%\n(1) Zinc equivalent pounds for Q1 2018 were calculated using the following realized prices: $16.75/oz Ag, $3.14/lb Cu, $1.15/lb Pb, $1.56/lb Zn, $1,334/oz Au.
