    "text": "Same-Show Growth Continued at GES\nPursuit Organic Revenue Grew Nearly 18%\nPHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Viad Corp (NYSE: VVI) today announced first quarter 2018 results that were in line with prior guidance. The expected year-over-year declines were driven by negative show rotation from non-annual events that occurred during the 2017 first quarter.\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\ny-o-y\nChange\n$ in millions, except per share data Revenue $ 277.4 $ 325.8 -14.8 % Organic Revenue* 271.2 325.8 -16.7 % Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Viad $ (9.4 ) $ 6.8 ** Income (Loss) Before Other Items* (9.9 ) 6.7 ** Income (Loss) Before Other Items per Share* (0.49 ) 0.33 ** Adjusted Segment Operating Income (Loss)* $ (10.5 ) $ 13.5 ** Adjusted Segment EBITDA* 2.5 25.6 -90.3 % ** Change is greater than 100%.\nRevenue of $277.4 million decreased 14.8% ($48.4 million) year-over-year, or 16.7% ($54.6 million) on an organic basis (which excludes the impact of exchange rate variances). The organic revenue decline primarily reflects negative show rotation. Exchange rate variances had a favorable impact on revenue of $6.2 million. Adjusted segment operating results, adjusted segment EBITDA and income before other items declined compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to the decrease in revenue.\nSteve Moster, president and chief executive officer, commented, “Viad delivered solid performance during the first quarter with both business units posting results that were in line with our expectations. GES continued to deliver same-show revenue growth and gain traction in the corporate events space, and Pursuit continued to benefit from our initiatives to maximize revenue at our leading attractions and hotels.”\nGES Results\nMoster said, “GES delivered solid results, with continued same-show growth that partially offset significant negative show rotation. We remain focused on driving in-sourcing benefits and pursuing additional cross-sell opportunities from our ON Services audio-visual production business, and capturing additional share in the corporate event space. I expect 2018 to be another year of solid progress toward our strategic goals, as we continue to position GES as the preferred global, full-service provider for live events.”\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\ny-o-y\nChange\n$ in millions Revenue $ 267.7 $ 317.9 -15.8 % U.S. Organic Revenue* 203.9 257.2 -20.7 % International Organic Revenue* 61.4 63.9 -3.9 % Adjusted Segment Operating Income* $ 0.6 $ 23.5 -97.3 % Adjusted Segment Operating Margin* 0.2 % 7.4 % -720 bps Adjusted Segment EBITDA* $ 10.4 $ 32.6 -68.1 % Adjusted Segment EBITDA Margin* 3.9 % 10.2 % -630 bps Key Performance Indicators:\nU.S. Base Same-Show Revenue Growth (1)\n3.7%\nU.S. Show Rotation Revenue Change (approx.) (2)\n$(52)\nInternational Show Rotation Revenue Change (approx.) (2)\n$(4)\n(1) Base same-shows are defined as shows produced by GES out of the same city during the same quarter in both the current year and prior year. Base same-shows represented 46.5% of GES’ U.S. organic revenue during the 2018 first quarter. (2) Show rotation refers to shows that take place once every two, three or four years, as well as annual shows that change quarters from one year to the next. GES revenue of $267.7 million decreased 15.8% ($50.2 million) year-over-year. On an organic basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate variances, revenue decreased 17.6% ($56.0 million). U.S. organic revenue decreased 20.7% ($53.3 million) primarily due to negative show rotation of $52 million and certain non-recurring business, partially offset by U.S. base same-show growth of 3.7%. International organic revenue decreased 3.9% ($2.5 million) primarily due to negative show rotation of approximately $4 million, partially offset by new business wins. GES adjusted segment operating income of $0.6 million* decreased $22.9 million year-over-year, and $22.8 million on an organic basis. U.S. organic adjusted segment operating results decreased by $23.0 million to a loss of $1.5 million* primarily due to the lower revenue. International organic adjusted segment operating income of $2.2 million* increased $0.1 million.\nPursuit Results\nMoster said, “Pursuit delivered strong organic revenue growth of 17.7% during its seasonally slow first quarter, driven primarily by our Banff Gondola and FlyOver Canada attractions. Our seasonal properties are just beginning to open and we continue to make good progress rebuilding the Mount Royal Hotel. The upgrades we are making to this marquee property are generating a lot of excitement amongst our travel trade customers, the local community and our team. We look forward to welcoming guests back to the Mount Royal Hotel during our busy summer tourism season.”\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\ny-o-y\nChange\n$ in millions Revenue $ 9.7 $ 7.9 22.5 % Organic Revenue* 9.3 7.9 17.7 % Adjusted Segment Operating Loss* $ (11.2 ) $ (10.0 ) 11.5 % Adjusted Segment Operating Margin* ** ** ** Adjusted Segment EBITDA* $ (7.9 ) $ (7.0 ) 13.4 % Adjusted Segment EBITDA Margin* -81.4 % -87.9 % 650 bps Key Performance Indicators: Same-Store RevPAR (1) $ 55 $ 49 12.2 % Same-Store Room Nights Available (1) 27,810 27,720 0.3 % Same-Store Passengers (2) 158,472 150,397 5.4 % Same-Store Revenue per Passenger (2) $ 28 $ 25 12.0 % (1) Same-store RevPAR is calculated as total rooms revenue divided by the total number of room nights available for all comparable Pursuit properties during the periods presented, expressed on a constant currency basis. Comparable properties are defined as those owned by Viad and operating for the entirety of both periods.

Comparable attractions are defined as those owned by Viad for the entirety of both periods. ** Change is greater than 100% or 1,000 basis points.\nPursuit revenue of $9.7 million increased 22.5% ($1.8 million) year-over-year. On an organic basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate variances, revenue increased 17.7% ($1.4 million) primarily due to better than expected growth at our Banff Jasper Collection. Pursuit adjusted segment operating loss of $11.2 million* increased 11.5% ($1.2 million) year-over-year. On an organic basis, the operating loss of $10.9 million increased $0.9 million primarily due to additional costs to support continued growth initiatives, as well as the timing of certain other expenses.\nCash Flow / Capital Structure\nCash flow from operations was an outflow of $3.4 million for the 2018 first quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $26.6 million, comprised of $16.0 million for Pursuit, $10.5 million for GES, and $0.1 million for the corporate office. Return of capital totaled $2.0 million for the quarter (which represented quarterly dividends of $0.10 per share). Viad had 440,540 shares remaining under its current repurchase authorization at March 31, 2018. Debt payments (net) totaled $20.7 million for the quarter. Cash and cash equivalents were $42.3 million, debt was $232.2 million and the debt-to-capital ratio was 35.1% at March 31, 2018.\nBusiness Outlook\nOur guidance is subject to change as a variety of factors, identified in the safe harbor language at the end of this press release, can affect actual results.\nWe have provided the following forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted Segment EBITDA, Adjusted Segment Operating Income and Income Before Other Items. We do not provide quantitative reconciliations of these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures because, due to variability and difficulty in developing accurate projections and/or certain information not being ascertainable or accessible, not all of the information necessary to do so is available to us without unreasonable effort. Consequently, any attempt to disclose such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that could be confusing or misleading to investors. It is probable that our forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures may be materially different from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.\n2018 Full Year Guidance\nWe expect consolidated revenue to increase at a low single-digit rate from 2017 full year revenue, driven primarily by continued growth in the underlying business and favorable exchange rate variances, partially offset by negative show rotation of about $40 million at GES. We expect consolidated adjusted segment EBITDA to be in the range of $156.5 million to $160.5 million, as compared to $154.5 million* in 2017. Our guidance assumes that exchange rates will approximate $0.79 U.S. Dollars per Canadian Dollar and $1.41 U.S. Dollars per British Pound during the rest of 2018. Accordingly, we expect exchange rate variances to impact 2018 full year results as follows:\nViad Total GES Pursuit $ in millions, except per share data Revenue $ 21 $ 19 $ 2 Adjusted Segment Operating Income $ 0.5 $ 0.5 - Income per Share Before Other Items $ 0.03 The outlook for our business units is as follows:\nGES Pursuit $ in millions Revenue Up slightly from $1,133 in 2017 Up high-single to low-double digits (from $174 in 2017)\nAdjusted Segment EBITDA $85 to $88 (vs. $88.4* in 2017) $71 to $73 (vs. $66.0* in 2017)\nDepreciation & Amortization $40 to $41 $20 to $21 Adjusted Operating Income $44.5 to $47.5 (vs. $51.2* in 2017) $50.5 to $52.5 (vs. $48.4* in 2017) Capital Expenditures $33 to $35 $59 to $63 We expect GES show rotation to have a net negative impact on full year revenue of about $40 million versus 2017. Show rotation refers to shows that occur less frequently than annually, as well as annual shows that shift quarters from one year to the next.\nQ1 Act. Q2 Est. Q3 Est. Q4 Est. FY Est. Show Rotation Revenue ($ in millions) $ (56 ) $ (15 ) $ 25 $ 5 $ (40 ) We expect GES U.S. base same-show revenue to increase at a low to mid-single digit rate. During 2017, GES adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted segment operating income included income of $2.8 million related to a contract settlement, which will not recur in 2018. We expect Pursuit revenue to be favorably impacted by approximately $5 million from the planned re-opening of the Mount Royal Hotel in July 2018, as well as continued focus on revenue management and refresh efforts across our attraction and hospitality portfolio. We expect start-up costs related to development of Pursuit’s FlyOver Iceland attraction, which is expected to open in 2019, to approximate $1 million during 2018 ($0.2 million of which was incurred during the first quarter). These costs are not included in the adjusted segment EBITDA or adjusted segment operating income guidance ranges above. Our capital expenditure guidance for Pursuit includes approximately $19 million to complete the restoration and renovation of the Mount Royal Hotel and approximately $10 million to begin development of the FlyOver Iceland attraction. The Mount Royal Hotel expenditures will be funded primarily by the property insurance proceeds received during 2017. The FlyOver Iceland expenditures will be funded out of our 2017 capital contribution to acquire the controlling interest in Esja Attractions ehf., the Icelandic entity that is developing the FlyOver Iceland attraction. We expect corporate activities expense to approximate $10 million to $11 million. We expect our effective tax rate on income before other items to approximate 30%, which is based on our current best estimates regarding the impact of Tax Reform. The higher rate relative to the 21% U.S. federal corporate tax rate is due to our foreign earnings in higher rate jurisdictions, the increase in non-deductible expenses, the GILTI tax, and an increase in our effective state tax rate.\n2018 Second Quarter Guidance\n2018 Guidance 2017 Low End High End FX Impact (1) $ in millions, except per share data Revenue: GES $ 320.1 $ 300 to $ 315 $ 7 Pursuit 44.7 49 to 52 2 Adjusted Operating Income: GES $30.7* $ 24 to\n$ 27 $ 0.5 Pursuit 10.0*\n9.5 to 12 0.5 Income per Share Before Other Items $1.22* $ 1.00\nto $ 1.15\n$\n0.04 (1) FX Impact represents the expected effect of year-over-year changes in exchange rates that is incorporated in the low end and high end guidance ranges presented. We expect GES second quarter results to decrease primarily due to negative show rotation revenue of approximately $15 million. We expect Pursuit second quarter revenue to increase primarily due to continued focus on revenue management and refresh efforts across our attraction and hospitality portfolio. Our operating income guidance reflects additional costs to support continued growth initiatives.\nConference Call and Web Cast\nWe will hold a conference call with investors and analysts for a review of first quarter 2018 results on Thursday, April 26, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. (ET).

(B) Other Expense — On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2017-07, which requires retrospective adoption. As a result, we recorded the nonservice cost component of net periodic benefit cost within other expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018, and we reclassified $0.5 million from operating expenses to other expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017 to conform to current period presentation. (C) Income Taxes — Income taxes went from an effective rate of 27% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 to an effective rate of 30% for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increase in the effective rate for 2018 was primarily due to our mix of domestic versus foreign income, which is taxed at higher rates. Additionally, as a result of Tax Reform, we are now subject to the GILTI tax, increased non-deductible expenses and a higher effective state tax rate, which partially offset the reduction in the federal tax rate. (D) Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations — The income from discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was primarily related to a favorable legal settlement related to previously sold operations. The loss from discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was primarily related to an increase in reserves to resolve certain environmental matters related to previously sold operations. (E) Income (Loss) per Common Share — Following is a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Viad to net income (loss) allocated to Viad common shareholders: Three months ended March 31, ($ in thousands, except per share data) 2018 2017 $ Change % Change Net income (loss) attributable to Viad $ (9,387 ) $ 6,777 $ (16,164 ) ** Less: Allocation to nonvested shares - (89 ) 89 -100.0 % Adjustment to the redemption value of redeemable noncontrolling interest (38 ) - (38 ) ** Net income (loss) allocated to Viad common shareholders $ (9,425 ) $ 6,688 $ (16,113 ) ** Weighted-average outstanding common shares 20,207 20,083 124 0.6 % Basic income (loss) per common share attributable to Viad common shareholders $ (0.47 ) $ 0.33 $ (0.80 ) ** ** Change is greater than +/- 100 percent VIAD CORP AND SUBSIDIARIES TABLE TWO - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (UNAUDITED) IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES REGARDING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This document includes the presentation of \"Income/(Loss) Before Other Items\", \"Adjusted EBITDA\", \"Adjusted Segment EBITDA\" and \"Adjusted Segment Operating Income/(Loss)\", which are supplemental to results presented under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. These non-GAAP measures are utilized by management to facilitate period-to-period comparisons and analysis of Viad’s operating performance and should be considered in addition to, but not as substitutes for, other similar measures reported in accordance with GAAP. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures is limited, compared to the GAAP measure of net income attributable to Viad, because they do not consider a variety of items affecting Viad’s consolidated financial performance as reconciled below. Because these non-GAAP measures do not consider all items affecting Viad’s consolidated financial performance, a user of Viad’s financial information should consider net income attributable to Viad as an important measure of financial performance because it provides a more complete measure of the Company’s performance. Income/(Loss) Before Other Items and Adjusted Segment Operating Income/(Loss) are considered useful operating metrics, in addition to net income attributable to Viad, as potential variations arising from non-operational expenses/income are eliminated, thus resulting in additional measures considered to be indicative of Viad’s performance. Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Segment EBITDA provide useful information to investors regarding Viad’s results of operations for trending, analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of Viad’s business. Management also believes that the presentation of Adjusted Segment EBITDA for acquisitions and other major capital projects enables investors to assess how effectively management is investing capital into major corporate development projects, both from a valuation and return perspective.

The impact of exchange rate variances (or \"FX Impact\") is calculated as the difference between current period activity translated at the current period's exchange rates and the comparable prior period's exchange rates. Management believes that the presentation of \"organic\" results permits investors to better understand Viad's performance without the effects of exchange rate variances or acquisitions.
