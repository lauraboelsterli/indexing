FILE PHOTO: A Heineken sign is seen at the main access to the new Heineken brewery in Meoqui, in Chihuahua state, Mexico February 27, 2018. REUTERS/Jose Luis Gonzalez/File Photo \nThe Dutch maker of Heineken, Tiger and Sol lagers said on Wednesday that its beer volumes were up 4.3 percent year-on-year, a shade below the average forecast in a Reuters poll of 5.0 percent. \nThe company benefited from an earlier Easter than in 2017, with stocking ahead of the festive period taking place in March rather than April, boosting volumes in the Americas and a later lunar New Year, helping Heineken in Asia. \nThe company said it retained its full-year outlook - that its operating profit margin should expand by around 25 basis points. \nThe company also said that the negative transitional impact of currencies would be 200 million euros (£173 million) on operating profit based on current exchange rates. In mid-February, it had put this figure at 190 million euros. Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop; editing by Robert-Jan Bartunek",
