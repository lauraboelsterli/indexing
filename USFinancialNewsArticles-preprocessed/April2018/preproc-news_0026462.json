    "text": "* Both indexes end 0.4 pct higher\n* Infosys close higher ahead of results on Friday\nApril 12 (Reuters) - Indian shares ended higher for a sixth straight session on Thursday, ahead of key retail inflation data later in the day, as a weakening rupee and expectations of positive quarterly results boosted information technology stocks.\nThe broader NSE index ended 0.4 percent higher at 10,458.65, while the benchmark BSE index closed 0.47 percent higher at 34,101.13.\nInfosys Ltd led the gains, closing 3.5 percent higher. The software services exporter will kick-start the January-March corporate results season on Friday.\nInvestors await March retail inflation data due later on Thursday for cues about the economy. Retail inflation likely eased to a five-month low in March as increases in food prices slowed once again but remained above the central bankâ€™s medium-term target, a Reuters poll found.\nFor midday report, click\nReporting by Vishal Sridhar in Bengaluru, Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips\n ",
