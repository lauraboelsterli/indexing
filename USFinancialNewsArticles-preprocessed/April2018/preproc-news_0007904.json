    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Nardello & Co. LLC, a leading global investigations firm, today announced that Mark Califano has joined the firm’s leadership team as its Chief Legal Officer and Regional Managing Director of the Americas.\nMr. Califano, a former federal prosecutor, has served in senior executive positions in both the public and private sectors and has extensive experience working with publicly-held global companies, multinational governments, law enforcement and regulatory authorities and courts. He has built and led teams that have completed complex global investigations and successfully defended cases in jurisdictions around the world, including up through the Supreme Court.\nMr. Califano joins Nardello & Co. from American Express, where he was Senior Vice President and Managing Counsel in charge of global litigation and government investigations, successfully defending and resolving billions of dollars of claims and challenges to company practices, products and IP. In the public sector, Mr. Califano built and led the investigative team for the Independent Inquiry Committee into the U.N. Oil-for-Food Programme, which identified and assessed unprecedented systemic corruption. Following the completion of the investigation, he co-authored Good Intentions Corrupted: The Oil for Food Scandal and the Threat to the UN – a definitive account of what was the largest corruption investigation in the world at the time. Previously, he served as a decorated Assistant United States Attorney in Connecticut, where he established and led a nationally- renowned cyber/IP prosecution team that conceived and pursued pioneering cybercrime, IP, corruption, financial fraud and terrorism investigations and prosecutions spanning over a dozen countries.\n“Mark’s diverse background and experience make him superbly qualified for this position, and we are fortunate to have someone of his caliber join the firm’s leadership team,” said Dan Nardello, Chief Executive Officer of Nardello & Co. “Mark’s wealth of experience with complex global investigations, compliance, corporate governance and cybersecurity will add immediate value to the firm.

That investigation developed hundreds of cases that led to an historic influx of corruption prosecutions by government authorities around the world.\nAdditionally, Mr. Califano was an Assistant US Attorney in Connecticut from 1992 to 2006, where he established and led a nationally-renowned cyber/IP prosecution team that conceived and pursued pioneering cybercrime, IP, corruption, financial fraud and terrorism investigations and prosecutions spanning over a dozen countries.
