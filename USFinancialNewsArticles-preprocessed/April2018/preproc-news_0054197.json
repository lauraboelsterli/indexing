Minter nailed down his first career save as the Atlanta Braves beat the host Cincinnati Reds 5-4 on Wednesday.\nWith runners on the corners in the ninth, Camargo lined a pitch from Dylan Floro off the glove of Reds shortstop Cliff Pennington that enabled Ozzie Albies to score. Albies was hit by a pitch by Kevin Shackelford to start the inning.\nThe winning pitcher was Dan Winkler (1-0), who pitched a scoreless eighth. Minter worked a perfect ninth, striking out one, to earn the save.\nThe losing pitcher was Shackelford (0-1), who allowed the tying run to score in the eighth and put two runners on in the ninth.\nAtlanta recalled rookie Ronald Acuna Jr. before the game and put him in the lineup. Acuna, considered one of the game’s top prospects, batted sixth and played left field. He went 1-for-5 with a single and scored a run in his big-league debut.\nNeither starting pitcher figured in the decision.\nCincinnati’s Brandon Finnegan pitched five innings and allowed three runs (two earned) on seven hits and one walk. He struck out four.\nAtlanta starter Matt Wisler worked five innings and allowed four runs — all in the fourth inning — on nine hits and three walks. He did not record a strikeout.\nThe Braves struck for a run in the first when Albies scored on an error by Reds second baseman Scooter Gennett.\nAtlanta added another run in the third when Camargo doubled home Ender Inciarte.\nThe Braves made it 3-0 when Albies connected for a solo homer, his seventh of the season.\nCincinnati scored four times in the fifth inning to take a 4-3 lead. Joey Votto hit a two-run homer, his second, to left-center field.\nThe Reds added a run when Scott Schebler lined to center fielder Inciarte, who made the catch. But the Reds appealed the catch and a video replay overturned the call and Schebler had an RBI double. Tucker Barnhart drove in Schebler with a double to right field.\nThe Braves tied the game at 4 in the eighth against Shackelford. Acuna singled with one out and scored on Kurt Suzuki’s two-out single.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
