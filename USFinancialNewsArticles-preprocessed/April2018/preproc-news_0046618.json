Excluding these items, the Company’s first quarter 2017 adjusted net loss was $16.4 million, or $0.22 adjusted loss per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017 was a loss of $6.9 million (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures below).\nTCE Revenue\nTCE Revenue Earned during the First Quarter of 2018\nOur Kamsarmax fleet earned $12,881 per day Our Ultramax fleet earned $9,757 per day\nVoyages Fixed thus far for the Second Quarter of 2018\nKamsarmax fleet: approximately $13,250 per day for 56% of the days Ultramax fleet: approximately $11,925 per day for 48% of the days\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAs of April 20, 2018, the Company had approximately $55.0 million in cash and cash equivalents.\nRecent Significant Events\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of its common stock under the Board of Directors authorized stock repurchase program at a cost of approximately $8.6 million, or at an average cost of $7.39 per share, which was funded from available cash resources. As of April 20, 2018, approximately $30.4 million of the $50.0 million authorized remains available for the repurchase of the Company’s common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions. The specific timing and amounts of any repurchases will be in the sole discretion of management and may vary based on market conditions and other factors and the Company is not obligated under the terms of the program to repurchase any of its common stock. The authorization has no expiration date.\nDividend\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors declared and the Company paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.02 per share totaling approximately $1.5 million.\nOn April 20, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.02 per share, payable on or about May 31, 2018, to all shareholders of record as of May 15, 2018. As of April 20, 2018, 75,971,175 shares were outstanding.\nDebt\n$12.8 Million Credit Facility\nOn April 3, 2018, the Company received a commitment for a loan facility of up to $12.75 million from a leading European financial institution to finance the Company’s Kamsarmax bulk carrier to be delivered from Jiangsu New Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Co Ltd in China in the third quarter of 2018. The loan facility will have a final maturity date of June 15, 2023 and bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.40% per annum. The terms and conditions will be similar to those set forth in the Company's existing credit facilities. The loan facility is subject to customary conditions precedent and the execution of definitive documentation.\n$19.0 Million Lease Financing\nOn April 17, 2018, the Company entered into a financing transaction in respect of one of its Ultramax vessels with an unaffiliated third party involving the sale and leaseback of the SBI Tango, a 2015 Japanese built Ultramax vessel, for consideration of approximately $19.0 million. As part of the transaction, the Company will make payments of $5,400 per day under a five-year bareboat charter agreement with the buyer. If converted to floating interest rates, based on the expected weighted average life of the transaction, the equivalent cost of financing at the then prevailing swap rates would be LIBOR + 1.73%.\nThe transaction also provides the Company with options to repurchase the vessel beginning on the third anniversary of the sale until the end of the bareboat charter agreement. This transaction, which shall be treated as a financial lease for accounting purposes, increases the Company’s liquidity by approximately $10.3 million after repayment of the vessel’s existing loan.\nDebt Overview\nThe Company’s outstanding debt balance, gross of unamortized deferred financing costs as of March 31, 2018 and April 20, 2018, are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nAs of\nMarch 31,\n2018 As of April 20, 2018 Credit Facility Amount\nOutstanding Amount\nOutstanding Amount\nCommitted Senior Notes $ 73,625 $ 73,625 $ — $409 Million Credit Facility 171,549 171,549 — $330 Million Credit Facility 241,746 241,746 — $42 Million Credit Facility * 22,354 22,354 — $67.5 Million Credit Facility 39,459 39,247 — $12.5 Million Credit Facility 9,988 9,988 — $27.3 Million Credit Facility 17,825 17,825 — $85.5 Million Credit Facility 83,868 83,868 — $38.7 Million Credit Facility 37,800 37,800 $19.6 Million Lease Financing 18,978 18,978 — $12.8 Million Credit Facility ** — — 12,750 $19.0 Million Lease Financing — — 19,000 Total $ 717,192 $ 716,980 $ 31,750 * $8.2 million to be repaid upon the drawdown of the $19.0 Million Lease Financing ** Reflects the maximum loan amount available on undrawn vessel.

(2) Includes $73.6 million repayment of Senior Notes due at maturity. Financial Results for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 Compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Company’s GAAP net loss was $5.8 million, or $0.08 loss per diluted share. For the same period in 2017, the Company’s GAAP net loss was $34.6 million, or $0.48 loss per diluted share. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 were $20.4 million and a loss of $10.8 million, respectively (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures). Excluding the loss/write off of vessels and assets held for sale of $17.7 million and the write off of deferred financing costs on the credit facility related to those specific vessels of $0.5 million, the Company’s adjusted net loss for the first quarter of 2017 was $16.4 million, or $0.22 adjusted loss per diluted share (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures below). There were no such non-GAAP adjustments to the Company’s first quarter 2018 net income.\nTotal vessel revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $54.3 million, an increase of $19.6 million from $34.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Our TCE revenue (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures) for the first quarter of 2018 was $54.1 million, an increase of $19.4 million from the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 revenues were driven by high levels of demand for coal and grains for the better part of the quarter.\nTotal operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $49.8 million compared to $60.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. The quarter over quarter decrease relates to the loss/write off of vessels and assets held for sale of $17.7 million recorded in the first quarter of 2017, offset in part by increases in vessel operating costs and depreciation resulting from the increase in the size of our fleet.\nUltramax Operations\nThree Months Ended March 31, Dollars in thousands 2018 2017 Change % Change TCE Revenue: Vessel revenue $ 33,330 $ 19,760 $ 13,570 69 Voyage expenses 128 49 79 161 TCE Revenue $ 33,202 $ 19,711 $ 13,491 68 Operating expenses: Vessel operating costs 17,236 12,145 5,091 42 Charterhire expense 915 10 905 NA Vessel depreciation 9,190 7,023 2,167 31 General and administrative expense 1,073 839 234 28 Total operating expenses $ 28,414 $ 20,017 $ 8,397 42 Operating income (loss) $ 4,788 $ (306 ) $ 5,094 1,665 Vessel revenue for our Ultramax Operations increased to $33.3 million for the first quarter of 2018 from $19.8 million in the prior year period.\nTCE revenue (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures) for our Ultramax Operations was $33.2 million for the first quarter of 2018 and was associated with a day-weighted average of 37 vessels owned and one time chartered-in vessel, compared to $19.7 million for the prior year period, which was associated with a day-weighted average of 28 vessels owned. TCE revenue per day was $9,757 and $8,230 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The market in the first quarter was comparatively strong to previous year’s with two major factors keeping levels buoyant. A strong Atlantic U.S. Gulf market in the fourth quarter of 2017 was sustained well into February 2018 due to strong coal exports and residual grain movement coupled with strong Pacific coal imports from Indonesia to China at the beginning of March 2018.\nDollars in thousands Three Months Ended March 31, Ultramax Operations: 2018 2017 Change % Change TCE Revenue $ 33,202 $ 19,711 $ 13,491 68 TCE Revenue / Day $ 9,757 $ 8,230 $ 1,527 19 Revenue Days 3,403 2,395 1,008 42 Our Ultramax Operations vessel operating costs were $17.2 million for the first quarter of 2018, including approximately $0.9 million of takeover costs and contingency expenses and related to 37 vessels owned, on average during the period. Vessel operating costs for the prior year period were $12.1 million and related to 28 vessels owned, on average during the period. Daily operating costs excluding other non-operating expenses for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 were $4,909 and $4,929, respectively. Sequentially, daily operating costs increased from $4,749 in the fourth quarter of 2017 due in large part to seasonality.\nCharterhire expense for our Ultramax Operations was approximately $0.9 million for the first quarter of 2018, and relates to the vessel we have time chartered-in at $10,125 per day.\nUltramax Operations depreciation increased to $9.2 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $7.0 million in the prior year period reflecting the increase in our weighted average vessels owned to 37 from 28.\nGeneral and administrative expense for our Ultramax Operations was $1.1 million for the first quarter of 2018 and $0.8 million in the prior year period. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of administrative service fees, which are incurred on a per vessel per day basis, and bank charges, which are incurred based on the number of transactions. The increase versus the prior year period reflects the growth of our fleet.\nKamsarmax Operations\nThree Months Ended March 31, Dollars in thousands 2018 2017 Change % Change TCE Revenue: Vessel revenue $ 20,923 $ 14,968 $ 5,955 40 Voyage expenses 68 68 — — TCE Revenue $ 20,855 $ 14,900 $ 5,955 40 Operating expenses: Vessel operating costs 8,571 9,661 (1,090 ) (11 ) Charterhire expense 90 1,961 (1,871 ) (95 ) Vessel depreciation 4,678 4,559 119 3 General and administrative expense 507 536 (29 ) (5 ) Loss / write down on assets held for sale — 17,131 (17,131 ) (100 ) Total operating expenses $ 13,846 $ 33,848 $ (20,002 ) (59 ) Operating income (loss) $ 7,009 $ (18,948 ) $ 25,957 137 Vessel revenue for our Kamsarmax Operations increased to $20.9 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $15.0 million in the prior year period.\nTCE revenue (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures) for our Kamsarmax Operations was $20.9 million for the first quarter of 2018 and was associated with a day-weighted average of 18 vessels owned, compared to $14.9 million for prior year period, which was associated with a day-weighted average of 19 vessels owned and one vessel time chartered-in. TCE revenue per day was $12,881 and $9,164 for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Kamsarmax market in the first quarter of 2018 was the best it has experienced in recent history. Initially mineral driven; in the Atlantic with significant exports from the East Coast of the U.S. and Colombia into Europe and India, in the Pacific due to strong Chinese pre-Chinese New Year imports, as well as Indian coal imports from Indonesia and Australia. After the Chinese New Year, activity started to slow down but expectations of a strong second quarter of 2018, driven by grain expectations, kept curves in contango and allowed owners to achieve premium rates for longer employments.\nDollars in thousands\nThree Months Ended March 31, Kamsarmax Operations: 2018 2017 Change % Change TCE Revenue $ 20,855 $ 14,900 $ 5,955 40 TCE Revenue / Day $ 12,881 $ 9,164 $ 3,717 41 Revenue Days 1,619 1,626 (7 ) — Kamsarmax Operations vessel operating costs were $8.6 million for the first quarter of 2018, including approximately $0.2 million of contingency expenses, related to 18 vessels owned, on average during the period. Vessel operating costs for the prior year period were $9.7 million and related to 19 vessels owned, on average during the period. Daily operating costs excluding takeover and other non-operating expenses for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 were $5,172 and $5,207, respectively. Sequentially, daily operating costs increased from $4,943 in the fourth quarter of 2017 due in large part to seasonality.\nWhile we do not time charter-in any Kamsarmax vessels, we have a profit and loss sharing agreement with a third party and during the first quarter of 2018, our share of the loss on that vessel was $0.1 million. During the prior year period, two Kamsarmax vessels were time chartered-in resulting in charterhire expense of $2.0 million.\nKamsarmax Operations depreciation remained relatively flat at $4.7 million in the first quarter 2018 compared to $4.6 million in the prior year period. Our weighted average vessels owned was 18 and 19, in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative expense for our Kamsarmax Operations was $0.5 million for both the first quarters of 2018 and 2017. The expense consists primarily of administrative services fees, which are incurred on a per vessel per day basis, and bank charges, which are incurred based on the number of transactions.\nDuring the first quarter of 2017, we recorded a write down on assets held for sale of $17.1 million related to the sale of two Kamsarmax vessels to an unaffiliated third party.\nCorporate\nCertain general and administrative expenses we incur and all of our financial expenses are not attributable to a specific segment. Accordingly, these costs are not allocated to any of our segments. These general and administrative expenses, including compensation, audit, legal and other professional fees, as well as the costs of being a public company, such as director fees, were $7.3 million and $6.4 million in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nFinancial expenses increased to $10.2 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $8.4 million in the prior year period due to an increase in the LIBOR rate and higher levels of debt. During the first quarter of 2017, we wrote off $0.5 million of deferred financing costs accumulated on credit facilities for which the related vessels were sold.\nScorpio Bulkers Inc. and Subsidiaries Consolidated Statements of Operations (Amounts in thousands, except per share data)\nUnaudited Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Revenue: Vessel revenue $ 54,253 $ 34,728 Operating expenses: Voyage expenses 196 117 Vessel operating costs 25,806 21,801 Charterhire expense 1,005 1,971 Vessel depreciation 13,868 11,582 General and administrative expenses 8,910 7,728 Loss / write down on assets held for sale — 17,702 Total operating expenses 49,785 60,901 Operating income (loss) 4,468 (26,173 ) Other income (expense): Interest income 214 262 Foreign exchange loss (87 ) (94 ) Financial expense, net (10,367 ) (8,559 ) Total other expense (10,240 ) (8,391 ) Net loss $ (5,772 ) $ (34,564 ) Loss per common share - basic and diluted $ (0.08 ) $ (0.48 ) Weighted-average shares outstanding - basic and diluted 72,702 71,735\nScorpio Bulkers Inc. and Subsidiaries Consolidated Balance Sheets (Dollars in thousands) Unaudited March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Assets Current assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 52,788 $ 68,535 Accounts receivable 9,282 7,933 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 6,922 6,087 Total current assets 68,992 82,555 Non-current assets Vessels, net 1,521,073 1,534,782 Vessels under construction 9,717 6,710 Deferred financing costs, net 2,811 3,068 Other assets 16,095 16,295 Total non-current assets 1,549,696 1,560,855 Total assets $ 1,618,688 $ 1,643,410 Liabilities and shareholders’ equity Current liabilities Bank loans, net $ 44,707 $ 46,993 Capital lease obligation 1,156 1,144 Accounts payable and accrued expenses 11,858 10,453 Total current liabilities 57,721 58,590 Non-current liabilities Bank loans, net 567,119 576,967 Capital lease obligation 17,447 17,747 Senior Notes, net 72,856 72,726 Total non-current liabilities 657,422 667,440 Total liabilities 715,143 726,030 Shareholders’ equity Preferred stock, $0.01 par value; 50,000,000 shares authorized; no shares issued or outstanding — — Common stock, $0.01 par value per share; authorized 112,500,000 shares; issued and outstanding 75,971,175 and 74,902,364 shares as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively 785 762 Paid-in capital 1,746,403 1,745,844 Common stock held in treasury, at cost; 2,635,413 and 1,465,448 shares at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively (19,649 ) (11,004 ) Accumulated deficit (823,994 ) (818,222 ) Total shareholders’ equity 903,545 917,380 Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity $ 1,618,688 $ 1,643,410\nScorpio Bulkers Inc. and Subsidiaries Statements of Cash Flows (unaudited) (Amounts in thousands) For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Operating activities Net loss $ (5,772 ) $ (34,564 ) Adjustment to reconcile net loss to net cash used by operating activities: Restricted stock amortization 2,125 3,862 Vessel depreciation 13,868 11,582 Amortization of deferred financing costs 1,482 1,360 Write off of deferred financing costs — 470 Loss / write down on assets held for sale — 16,471 Changes in operating assets and liabilities: (Decrease) increase in accounts receivable (1,349 ) 1,337 Increase in prepaid expenses and other assets (635 ) (697 ) Increase (decrease) in accounts payable and accrued expenses 1,405 (1,556 ) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 11,124 (1,735 ) Investing activities Payments for vessels and vessels under construction (3,166 ) (22,421 ) Net cash used in investing activities (3,166 ) (22,421 ) Financing activities Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt — 51,600 Repayments of long-term debt (13,431 ) (2,580 ) Common stock repurchased (8,645 ) — Dividend paid (1,542 ) — Debt issue costs paid (87 ) — Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (23,705 ) 49,020 (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents (15,747 ) 24,864 Cash at cash equivalents, beginning of period 68,535 101,734 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 52,788 $ 126,598\nScorpio Bulkers Inc. and Subsidiaries Other Operating Data (unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Time charter equivalent revenue ($000’s) (1) : Vessel revenue $ 54,253 $ 34,728 Voyage expenses (196 ) (117 ) Time charter equivalent revenue $ 54,057 $ 34,611 Time charter equivalent revenue attributable to: Kamsarmax $ 20,855 $ 14,900 Ultramax 33,202 19,711 $ 54,057 $ 34,611 Revenue days: Kamsarmax 1,619 1,626 Ultramax 3,403 2,395 Combined 5,022 4,021 TCE per revenue day (1) : Kamsarmax $ 12,881 $ 9,164 Ultramax $ 9,757 $ 8,230 Combined $ 10,764 $ 8,608 (1) We define Time Charter Equivalent (TCE) revenue as vessel revenues less voyage expenses. Such TCE revenue, divided by the number of our available days during the period, or revenue days, is TCE per revenue day, which is consistent with industry standards. TCE per revenue day is a common shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare daily earnings generated by vessels on time charters with daily earnings generated by vessels on voyage charters, because charter hire rates for vessels on voyage charters are generally not expressed in per-day amounts while charter hire rates for vessels on time charters generally are expressed in such amounts. We report TCE revenue, a non-GAAP financial measure, because (i) we believe it provides additional meaningful information in conjunction with vessel revenues and voyage expenses, the most directly comparable U.S.-GAAP measure, (ii) it assists our management in making decisions regarding the deployment and use of our vessels and in evaluating their financial performance, (iii) it is a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in a shipping company’s performance irrespective of changes in the mix of charter types (i.e., spot charters, time charters and bareboat charters) under which the vessels may be employed between the periods, and (iv) we believe that it presents useful information to investors.

Scorpio Bulkers Inc. has an operating fleet of 56 vessels consisting of 55 wholly-owned or finance leased drybulk vessels (including 18 Kamsarmax vessels and 37 Ultramax vessels), and one time chartered-in Ultramax vessel. In addition, one Kamsarmax vessel which is being constructed at Jiangsu New Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Co Ltd in China is expected to be delivered to the Company in the third quarter of 2018. Upon final delivery of the last vessel, the Company’s owned and finance leased fleet is expected to have a total carrying capacity of approximately 3.9 million dwt and all of the Company’s owned vessels will have carrying capacities of greater than 60,000 dwt. Additional information about the Company is available on the Company’s website www.scorpiobulkers.com , which is not a part of this press release.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our financial information presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., (“GAAP”), management uses certain “non-GAAP financial measures” as such term is defined in Regulation G promulgated by the SEC. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s operating performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in, or excluded from, the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Management believes the presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and supplemental data relating to our financial condition and results of operations, and therefore a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than GAAP measures alone. In addition, management believes the presentation of these matters is useful to investors for period-to-period comparison of results as the items may reflect certain unique and/or non-operating items such as asset sales, write-offs, contract termination costs or items outside of management’s control.\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), adjusted net loss and related per share amounts, as well as adjusted EBITDA and TCE Revenue are non-GAAP performance measures that we believe provide investors with a means of evaluating and understanding how the Company’s management evaluates the Company’s operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, as substitutes for, nor superior to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Please see below for reconciliations of EBITDA, adjusted net loss and related per share amounts, and adjusted EBITDA. Please see “Other Operating Data” for a reconciliation of TCE revenue.\nEBITDA (unaudited)\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31, In thousands 2018 2017 Net loss $ (5,772 ) (34,564 ) Add Back: Net interest expense 8,671 6,467 Depreciation and amortization (1) 17,475 17,275 EBITDA $ 20,374 (10,822 ) (1) Includes depreciation, amortization of deferred financing costs and restricted stock amortization.

Forward-Looking Statements\nMatters discussed in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides safe harbor protections for forward-looking statements in order to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their business. Forward-looking statements include statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance, and underlying assumptions and other statements, which are other than statements of historical facts. The Company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and is including this cautionary statement in connection with this safe harbor legislation. The words “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “project,” “plan,” “potential,” “may,” “should,” “expect,” “pending” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements.\nThe forward-looking statements in this press release are based upon various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions, including without limitation, our management’s examination of historical operating trends, data contained in our records and other data available from third parties. Although we believe that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because these assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond our control, we cannot assure you that we will achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or projections.\nIn addition to these important factors, other important factors that, in our view, could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include the failure of counterparties to fully perform their contracts with us, the strength of world economies and currencies, general market conditions, including fluctuations in charter rates and vessel values, changes in demand for dry bulk vessel capacity, changes in our operating expenses, including bunker prices, drydocking and insurance costs, the market for our vessels, availability of financing and refinancing, charter counterparty performance, ability to obtain financing and comply with covenants in such financing arrangements, changes in governmental rules and regulations or actions taken by regulatory authorities, potential liability from pending or future litigation, general domestic and international political conditions, potential disruption of shipping routes due to accidents or political events, vessels breakdowns and instances of off-hires and other factors. Please see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a more complete discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties.\nContact: Scorpio Bulkers Inc. +377-9798-5715 (Monaco) +1-646-432-1675 (New York)\nSource:Scorpio Bulkers",
