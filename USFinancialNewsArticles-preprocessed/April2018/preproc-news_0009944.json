    "text": "The dollar slipped on Friday after a report showed the U.S. economy in March created the fewest jobs in six months, although losses were limited by a pickup in wage gains.\nData showed that U.S. nonfarm payrolls increased by 103,000 last month as the construction and retail sectors shed jobs. That was the smallest job growth since September and followed a 326,000 surge in February. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the economy adding 193,000 jobs last month\nBut wage growth edged up last month, with average hourly earnings rising eight cents or 0.3 percent after edging up 0.1 percent in February.\nThe report comes amid a series of mixed signals for the economy.\nThe escalating trade conflict between the United States and China hasn't affected currency markets. Most pairs remain in ranges and a gauge of currency market volatility was near 2018 lows.\n\"Despite the recent weakness of the dollar, on a historical basis, the greenback is trading at the upper end of historical ranges and unless we see a marked shift in the Feds policy tone or a sustained upward surprise in economic data, we expect any dollar gains to be limited,\" said John Goldie, an FX dealer at Argentex based in London.\nIn the latest salvo, Beijing warned it would fight back \"at any cost\" if the United States stuck to its protectionist stance, after President Donald Trump threatened to impose an extra $100 billion in tariffs.\n\"Any escalation in the trade war rhetoric would be more negative for China than the U.S., given the former's relative dependency on trade, but for now, the markets are focused on the payrolls data,\" said Richard Falkenhall, a senior currency strategist at SEB in Stockholm.\nshow chapters Trump's tariffs will hurt the US economy a lot: Societe Generale 12 Hours Ago | 03:55 Mainland China markets were shut for a holiday. The offshore yuan was trading weaker against the dollar\nIn afternoon trading, the dollar was down 0.47 percent versus the yen at 106.86 yen, while the euro gained 0.38 percent at $1.2285.\nA half-percent gain in the dollar index this week trimmed its year-to-date losses against a basket of currencies to less than 2 percent so far this year after a decline of more than 10 percent in 2017. But some investors say it is still trading at the upper end of its trading ranges.\n\"The dollar's resilience may be a sign that short-term market positioning is tilted toward being short the dollar and long the yen,\" said Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for Oanda in Singapore.\n\"My feeling is everybody owns yen and the problem is they need some new story lines ... We've got an over-subscribed trade,\" Innes said, referring to bullish bets on the yen.\nMarket participants cautioned, though, that the yen could gain further if U.S. stock markets come under pressure on Friday.\nU.S. S&P 500 E-mini futures were down as much as 0.8 percent, pointing to a lower start for Wall Street. European stock futures were trading as much as 0.2 to 0.7 percent lower.",
