    "text": "April 6, 2018 / 9:03 AM / Updated 36 minutes ago UK productivity picks up strongly in second half of 2017 - stats agency Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - Britainâ€™s economy chalked up solid productivity growth in the last three months of 2017 to record its strongest six months in more than a decade, figures showed on Friday. FILE PHOTO: A man works on the production line at the Toyota factory in Derby, central England, March 7, 2011. REUTERS/Darren Staples/File Photo \nEconomic output per hour worked rose by 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 - above its long-run average though a shade less than first estimated in February - and the third-quarter figure was revised up slightly to 1.0 percent. Together they show the strongest growth since the second half of 2005. \nBritish productivity has largely stagnated over the past decade and overall output per hour, a driver of living standards, is only 1.8 percent above the pre-financial crisis peak it reached at the end of 2007.
