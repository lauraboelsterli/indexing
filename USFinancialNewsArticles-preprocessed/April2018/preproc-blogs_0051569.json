    "text": "Trump tweet\nThis is not the first exchange of pleasantries between the rap star and the real estate mogul.\nBack on the campaign trail in 2015, Trump said of West, \"I will never say bad about him, you know why? Because he loves Trump!\"\nFlash forward to November 2016, when West told his audience during a performance after the election that \"If I would've voted, I would've voted [for] Trump.\"\nWest met the president-elect at Trump Tower in Manhattan in December 2016, whereafter Trump told reporters, \"We've been friends for a long time.\"\nThe Wednesday tweets appear to be the first exchange between the two men since Trump's inauguration, as well as their first exchange on Twitter.\nAfter sending his \"dragon energy\" tweet, West posted a series of photos of himself wearing and holding the red \"Make America Great Again\" baseball cap made famous during the 2016 campaign.",
