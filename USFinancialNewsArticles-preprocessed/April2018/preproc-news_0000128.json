The FDA has also requested a bioavailability study to show bridging data between the drug and the reference drug, buprenorphine. \nALKS 5461, a once-daily pill combining samidorphan and buprenorphine, is designed to rebalance brain function that becomes dysregulated in the state of depression. \nIn Oct 2016, ALKS 5461 significantly reduced symptoms of depression compared to a placebo in a third late-stage study, after failing to achieve efficacy goals in two earlier late-stage studies. \nAn estimated 16.2 million people in the United States suffered from major depressive disorder in 2016, according to the company, and a majority of the patients do not adequately respond to initial anti-depressant therapy.
