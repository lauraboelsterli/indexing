Didier Kling and Finexsi Audit as merger auditors by order dated 14 February 2018.\nThe Supervisory Board of ANF Immobilier decided to put in place an ad hoc committee for this planned merger and an independent expert (JPA, represented by M. Jacques Potdevin) was designated to issue a report on the appropriate merger ratio in the interest of all shareholders.\nOn the basis of works carried out since the announcement of the planned merger, the Supervisory Board, at the recommendation of its ad hoc committee and the Management Board of ANF Immobilier dated 24 April 2018, as well as the Board of Directors of Icade dated 25 April 2018 have approved the narrowing of the indicative merger ratio range to 0.26 and 0.28 Icade share for 1 ANF Immobilier share.\nThe information and consultation procedure of the employee representative committee (Comité d’Entreprise) of Icade, as well as of the sole employee representative body (Délégation Unique du Personnel) of ANF Immobilier are still pending, opinions should be rendered by 16 May 2018.\nThe definitive merger ratio proposed to the shareholders of both ANF Immobilier and Icade will be set at the next meetings of the Management Board and of the Supervisory Board of ANF Immobilier and of the Board of Directors of Icade, that will be held in mid-May 2018.\nIt is recalled that the transaction is subject to usual conditions precedent, particularly confirmation by the French Financial Markets Authority (Autorité des marchés financiers, AMF) that the merger will not result in any obligation for Icade to launch an offer on the shares of ANF Immobilier under Article 236-6 of the AMF General Regulations and the approval by the Extraordinary General Meetings of shareholders of both ANF Immobilier and Icade to be held in June 2018.\nIcade will later publish a press release presenting the features of the merger in accordance with the provisions of Article 17 of Instruction DOC-2016-04 of 21 October 2016 of the AMF.\nDocuments intended for shareholders for the purpose of the proposed merger will be made available in the manner and times provided for by the applicable regulation.\nDisclaimer\nThis announcement is for information purposes only and is not intended to constitute, and should not be construed as, an offer to sell or subscribe for or a solicitation of any offer to buy or subscribe for (or any announcement of such a forthcoming offer or solicitation) securities in France, the United States of America (the \"United States\") or in any other jurisdiction.
