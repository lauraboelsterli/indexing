    "text": "SANTA ROSA, Calif., April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Luther Burbank Corporation (NASDAQ:LBC) (the “Company”), the holding company for Luther Burbank Savings (the “Bank”), today reported net income available to common shareholders of $11.1 million, or $0.20 diluted earnings per common share (“EPS”), for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to net income available to common shareholders of $12.3 million, or $0.29 EPS, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Pre-tax, pre-provision earnings and pro-forma EPS for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $16.8 million and $0.20, respectively, compared to $13.0 million and $0.18, respectively, for the same period last year.\nPre-tax, pre-provision earnings and pro-forma EPS, both non-GAAP financial measures, are presented because management believes these financial metrics provide stockholders with useful information for evaluating the profitability of the Company. In addition, management believes it enhances the comparability of the Company’s financial results by eliminating the tax differences associated with the Company’s change in tax status from an S-corporation to a C-corporation. The Company revoked its S-corporation status in December 2017. A schedule reconciling our GAAP net income to pre-tax, pre-provision earnings and pro-forma EPS are provided in the tables below.\nJohn G. Biggs, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We are extremely pleased with our results in the first quarter after a successful initial public offering in December 2017. For the first time in our history, we’ve exceeded $6 billion in total assets fueled by strong growth in our loan and deposit portfolios. In addition to our 6% growth in assets since year-end 2017, net interest income increased by over 13% compared to the same period last year and our efficiency ratio improved to 47%, which is one of the best efficiency ratios amongst our industry peers.”\nMr. Biggs continued, “Looking forward, I’m excited for the opening of our new branch in Bellevue, WA in mid-2018, as well as the recent announcement regarding the expansion of our construction lending operations. These initiatives will further support our growth and financial objectives and will continue our expansion into key strategic markets.”\nBoard Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.0575 Per Share\nOn April 26, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.0575 per common share. The dividend is payable on May 17, 2018 to shareholders of record as of May 7, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Earnings Summary\nNet interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 totaled $30.5 million compared to $27.6 million for the previous quarter and $26.9 million for the same period last year. The increase in net interest income was primarily related to growth in the average balance of our loans outstanding compared to the previous quarter and the same period last year. Net interest margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was 2.11%, compared to 2.05% for the previous quarter and 2.10% for the 2017 first quarter.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 totaled $1.0 million, compared to $1.5 million for the previous quarter and $882 thousand for the 2017 first quarter. The reduction of $469 thousand in noninterest income, or 31.4%, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to the linked quarter ended December 31, 2017, was attributable to a decrease of $341 thousand in other fee income related to mortgage servicing rights amortization. The increase of $143 thousand in noninterest income, or 16.2%, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2017, was primarily attributable to fair value losses incurred in connection with the discontinuation of our retail mortgage operations during the first quarter of 2017.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 totaled $14.7 million compared to $13.2 million for the previous quarter and $14.7 million for the 2017 first quarter. The increase of $1.5 million, or 11.3%, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to the linked quarter ended December 31, 2017, was primarily attributable to an increase of $1.5 million in compensation and related benefits.\nBalance Sheet Summary\nTotal assets at March 31, 2018 were $6.0 billion, an increase of $329.5 million from December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to a $284.9 million increase in loans and a $35.2 million increase in available for sale investment securities.\nLoans\nThe multifamily residential (“MFR”) mortgage loan portfolio totaled $3.1 billion at March 31, 2018 compared to $2.9 billion at December 31, 2017 and represents 58.1% of the total loan portfolio. The yield on the MFR portfolio was 3.72% during the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to 3.65% during the previous quarter and 3.45% during the same period last year. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, MFR loan originations and the corresponding weighted average coupon totaled $241.8 million and 4.29%, respectively, compared to $410.2 million and 3.87%, respectively, for the same period last year. MFR loan originations were higher during the same period last year due to anticipated loan sales during 2017. Prepayment speeds within the MFR loan portfolio were 4.6% and 15.7% during the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe single family residential mortgage loan portfolio totaled $2.1 billion at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 and represents 38.9% of the total loan portfolio. The yield on the SFR portfolio was 3.35% during the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to 3.29% during the previous quarter and 3.22% during the same period last year. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, residential loan originations and the corresponding weighted average coupon totaled $215.2 million and 4.29%, respectively, compared to $123.9 million and 3.96%, respectively, for the same period last year. The fluctuation in SFR originations was primarily attributable to an increase in customer demand experienced during the current quarter compared to the same period last year. Prepayment speeds within the SFR loan portfolio were 21.3% and 24.3% during the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nDeposits\nDeposits totaled $4.1 billion at March 31, 2018, an increase of $162.8 million from December 31, 2017. Retail deposits represented 89% of the growth, or $145.3 million, while wholesale deposits represented 11%, or $17.4 million. Our cost of deposits was 1.19% during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to 1.15% during the prior quarter and 0.96% during the same period last year. The change in our cost of deposits was primarily related to increases in our time deposit portfolio, which rate increased to 1.44% during the current period due to competitive pressures.\nCapital\nStockholders’ equity totaled $553.8 million, or 9.2% of total assets at March 31, 2018, an increase of $4.0 million from December 31, 2017, or an increase of 0.7%. Both the Bank’s and the Company’s capital levels continue to be significantly above the minimum levels required to be designated as “well-capitalized” for bank regulatory purposes. At March 31, 2018, Tier 1 leverage, Common Equity Tier 1 risk based, Tier 1 risk-based and Total risk-based capital ratios were 11.90%, 19.44%, 19.44% and 20.39%, respectively for the Bank, and 10.57%, 15.55%, 17.27% and 18.22%, respectively for the Company. At March 31, 2018, the Company’s tangible stockholders' equity ratio was 9.13%.\nAsset Quality\nNon-performing loans, totaled $7.0 million, or 0.13% of total loans, at March 31, 2018, compared to $7.0 million, or 0.14% of total loans, at December 31, 2017. There was not any real estate owned at March 31, 2018 or December 31, 2017. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, a $1.5 million loan loss provision was recorded compared to a $1.3 million provision in the prior quarter and a $309 thousand provision recorded in the first quarter of 2017.\nAbout Luther Burbank Corporation\nLuther Burbank Corporation is a publicly owned company traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “LBC.” The Company is headquartered in Santa Rosa, California with total assets of $6.0 billion, total loans of $5.3 billion and total deposits of $4.1 billion as of March 31, 2018.

These reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, future events and our results of operations, financial condition and financial performance. All statements contained in this communication that are not clearly historical in nature are forward-looking, and the words such as \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" “continue,” \"could,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" “impact,” \"intend,\" \"seek,\" \"may,\" \"outlook,\" \"plan,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"should,\" \"will,\" \"would\" and similar terms and phrases are generally intended to identify . These are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Accordingly, we caution you that any such are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the . Such factors include, without limitation, the “Risk Factors” referenced in our Registration Statement on Form S-1 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The risks and uncertainties listed from time to time in our reports and documents filed with the SEC, and the following factors: business and economic conditions generally and in the financial services industry, nationally and within our current and future geographic market areas; economic, market, operational, liquidity, credit and interest rate risks associated with our business; the occurrence of significant natural or man-made disasters, including fires, earthquakes, and terrorist acts; our management of risks inherent in our real estate loan portfolio, and the risk of a prolonged downturn in the real estate market; our ability to achieve organic loan and deposit growth and the composition of such growth; the fiscal position of the U.S federal government and the soundness of other financial institutions; changes in consumer spending and savings habits; technological and social media changes; the laws and regulations applicable to our business; increased competition in the financial services industry; changes in the level of our nonperforming assets and charge-offs; our involvement from time to time in legal proceedings and examination and remedial actions by regulators; the composition of our management team and our ability to attract and retain key personnel; material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; systems failures or interruptions involving our information technology and telecommunications systems; and potential exposure to fraud, negligence, computer theft and cyber-crime.

We compensate for these limitations by providing the equivalent GAAP measures whenever we present the non-GAAP financial measures and by including a reconciliation of the impact of the components adjusted for in the non-GAAP financial measure so that both measures and the individual components may be considered when analyzing our performance.
