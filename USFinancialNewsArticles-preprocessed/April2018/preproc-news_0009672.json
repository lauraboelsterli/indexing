    "text": "HONG KONG, April 6 (Reuters) - China’s Red Star Macalline Group Corp Ltd said it plans to buy back HK$4.6 billion ($585 million) of its Hong Kong-listed shares to boost earnings per share and as it feels its stock price does not reflect its earnings performance.\nThe furniture store and shopping mall operator said it will offer HK$11.78 per share, a 17.6 percent premium to the previous close, to buy up to 388.92 million shares, or 9.9 percent of its total issued share capital.\nThe deal will be funded by internal resources. The company said it will not make an offer for its Shanghai-listed shares.\nUp to Thursday’s close, the company shares had fallen 21 percent for the year to date, underperforming a 1.3 percent slide in the benchmark index.
