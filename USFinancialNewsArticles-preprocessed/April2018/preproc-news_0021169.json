    "text": "TOKYO, Japanese stocks fell for the first time in three days on Wednesday following a strong rally the previous day, but index-heavy SoftBank rose after sources said that Sprint is in new talks to merge with T-Mobile.\nThe Nikkei ended 0.5 percent lower to 21,687.10, after rising for the past two days. The market, along with a host of global risk assets, had a solid session on Tuesday after China’s helped ease fears over a U.S.-China trade war.\nInvestors were keeping a wary eye on discussions between U.S. President Donald Trump and Western allies on possible military action over a suspected poison gas attack on Saturday in Syria, allegedly ordered by President Bashar al-Assad.\nRetail stocks lost ground after department store operator J.Front Retailing dived 9.3 percent after its profit forecast for this fiscal year undershot market expectations. Rival Takashimaya Co tumbled 3.3 percent.\nFood shares also lost ground, with Kikkoman shedding 3.6 percent and Asahi Group sliding 2.2 percent.\nSoftBank Corp, Sprint Corp’s majority owner, surged 3.5 percent after sources said that Sprint has restarted talks to merge with T-Mobile US Inc.\nSoftBank contributed a hefty 29 points to the Nikkei index.\nThe broader Topix declined 0.4 percent to 1,725.30.
