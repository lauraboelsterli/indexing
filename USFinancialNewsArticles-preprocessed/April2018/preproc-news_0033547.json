    "text": "A former top executive at Verizon, Walden will lead Globetouch’s Board of Directors as the company further solidifies its position in the IoT market\nFREMONT, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Globetouch , a leader in global connectivity services for the connected car and the Internet of Things (IoT), has today announced the appointment of Marni Walden as Chair of its Board of Directors.\nWalden brings more than 20 years’ experience, including leadership roles at Verizon, most recently playing a key role in the acquisition of Yahoo and its merger with AOL. She will be leveraging her experience in the wireless industry to guide the Board and the wider Globetouch team, including recently appointed CEO Alfredo de Cárdenas.\nWalden, who left the position as Verizon’s Strategic Advisor in February, served as Executive Vice President and President of Global Media before that. As the company’s top-ranking female executive, Walden teamed with AOL CEO Tim Armstrong to create Oath, which now encompasses all of Verizon's media and advertising businesses.\nWalden’s previous experience includes working for AT&T Wireless, McCaw Communications and General Cellular. She also served as Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President of Cellco Partnership, (now Verizon Wireless) and was responsible for the nationwide operations and delivery of industry-leading performance for consumer and business customers.\nIn her role as President of Product & New Business Innovation at Verizon Communications, Walden oversaw a company-wide initiative focused on leveraging all of Verizon’s assets to quickly develop innovative products across the Verizon wireless, wireline, IP and cloud networks and platforms.\n“There are some prime opportunities for growth in the connectivity space right now, and Globetouch has the advantage of being positioned squarely at the center of them all,” said Walden. “It’s an exciting time to take the lead of Globetouch’s Board, at such a pivotal moment in the industry, and I look forward to helping the company fulfill its vision of driving innovation in the IoT economy.”\nArun Sarin, previous Chairman of the Board, will continue as a Board Member. “It was an easy decision to make,” states Sarin. “Marni’s experience and clout are a perfect fit to guide and support Globetouch in this dynamic arena. We can’t wait to get started and know all our MNO partners will be equally excited to have her direct the board.”\n“We have an unbelievably strong board. All members bring unique industry insights to the table in guiding the company,” said Globetouch’s CEO, Alfredo de Cárdenas. “Their foresight and experience, combined with the wealth of opportunities currently in the market, will help strengthen our industry position at a momentous time for this company.”\nAbout Globetouch\nGlobetouch is a leader in global connectivity services for the connected car and the IoT.
