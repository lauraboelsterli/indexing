    "text": "RIO DE JANEIRO, April 3 (Reuters) - Authorities in the Brazilian state of Para have sued Norsk Hydro ASA for 250 million reais ($74.83 million) in damages following an alleged toxic leak at the world’s largest alumina refinery Alunorte, a unit of the Norwegian firm.\nThe suit, filed by the state attorney general’s office, comes after the company admitted to dumping untreated rainwater from the refinery into the environment.\nThe Norwegian aluminum producer said it would invest around 212 million reais in a water treatment system for the refinery after the February incident.
