    "text": "HONG KONG, April 26 (Reuters) - Chinese infant formula maker Beingmate Baby & Child Food Co Ltd said on Thursday its net loss widened to 1.06 billion yuan ($167.6 million) in 2017 on slowing sales due to tougher competition and rising marketing costs.\nIt was the second consecutive annual loss for Beingmate, backed by New Zealand dairy giant Fonterra, after the Shanghai-based company posted a 780.67 million yuan loss in 2016.\nBeingmate said revenue fell 3.76 percent to 2.66 billion yuan in 2017 compared to a year earlier.\nFonterra, the world’s largest dairy exporter, reported in March a half-year loss of NZ$348 million for the six months to Jan. 31, including a NZ$405 million writedown on its 18.8 percent stake in Beingmate.\nTrading in Shenzhen-listed Beingmate was halted on Thursday after the company issued a delisting risk warning in the wake of the losses. Trading in the company’s shares will resume on Friday. ($1 = 6.3250 Chinese yuan renminbi) (Reporting by Donny Kwok; Editing by Darren Schuettler)\n ",
