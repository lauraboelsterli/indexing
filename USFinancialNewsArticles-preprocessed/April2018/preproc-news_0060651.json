    "text": "April 29, 2018 / 11:57 AM / Updated 44 minutes ago Three dead after transport plane crashes at Libya oilfield Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nBENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - A Libyan transport plane crashed on Sunday at an airfield at El Sharara oilfield, killing three people, an oil engineer said.\nThe two pilots and a flight assistant were killed in the crash, said the engineer who works at the field.\nAuthorities use aircraft to deliver supplies to the remote oilfield.\nThe plane crashed and exploded in the desert away from the oilfield’s facilities.\nSharara is seen as crucial to helping Libya’s economic recovery but output has been repeatedly disrupted due to blockades by armed groups, protests and other security problems.\nThe field is currently producing more than 300,000 barrels per day, the engineer said.
