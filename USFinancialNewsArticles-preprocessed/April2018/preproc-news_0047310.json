But it’s funny. Don’t worry,” he said of the crowd’s reaction.\nIn Argentina, he and Italian great Valentino Rossi collided — with the Yamaha rider accusing the champion of “destroying” MotoGP by what he considered dangerous behaviour on track.\n“I’m scared on the track when I’m with Marquez,” Rossi had said.\nMarquez did himself no favours in Saturday’s qualifying either, crashing before returning on a spare bike and then picking up the grid penalty for blocking Vinales who was on a hot lap.\nSpaniard Dani Pedrosa finished seventh for Honda, two weeks after fracturing his wrist and undergoing surgery.
