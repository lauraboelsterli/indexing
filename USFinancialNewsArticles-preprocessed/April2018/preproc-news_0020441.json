    "text": "EditorsNote: rewords third graf\nRoberto Perez hit a go-ahead solo homer in the eighth inning Tuesday night, lifting the Cleveland Indians to a 2-1 win over the visiting Detroit Tigers.\nPerez ripped a 2-0 offering from reliever Alex Wilson (0-2) over the right-center wall. Jose Ramirez, who hit a solo shot in the first inning, and Perez each had two of the Indians’ four hits.\nAndrew Miller (1-0), the fifth Indians pitcher, threw a scoreless eighth inning to get the win. Cody Allen retired the side in order in the ninth for his third save. Cleveland starter Josh Tomlin pitched five scoreless innings, allowing four hits and two walks while striking out three.\nTigers starter Matthew Boyd tossed seven innings and gave up just one run on three hits with a walk and four strikeouts. Jeimer Candelario had three of Detroit’s six hits, including an RBI double.\nThe Indians won the opener of the four-game series 2-0 on Monday behind a dominating performance from ace Corey Kluber. The second game turned into another pitchers’ duel.\nDetroit had two baserunners in the first inning, but Tomlin induced Victor Martinez to ground out to snuff that threat. Ramirez put Cleveland on the board with two outs in the bottom of the inning, drilling a 1-1 pitch into the left field stands.\nThe Tigers threatened again in the third, loading the bases with two out, but Niko Goodrum was retired on a comebacker to Tomlin.\nCandelario smacked a one-out double in the fifth but was stranded when Miguel Cabrera grounded out and Nicholas Castellanos struck out.\nTigers outfielder Victor Reyes led off the seventh against Tyler Olson with a single, his first major league hit. As Dixon Machado struck out, Reyes stole second and advanced on the errant throw by catcher Perez.\nDan Otero then entered and struck out JaCoby Jones looking before Candelario drilled a double down the left field line, ending a Tigers streak of 23 scoreless innings, their longest drought since 2008.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
