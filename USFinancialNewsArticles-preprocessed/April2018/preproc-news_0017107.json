It is also noteworthy that Xi set a timeline to finish some key reforms this year, suggesting the government might accelerate the reforms,” wrote Chaoping Zhu, Global Market Strategist, J.P. Morgan Asset Management.\n“That said, this speech did not represent a major shift in Chinese policy and it is likely the U.S.-China trade dispute will require more negotiation,” he said, advising investors to prepare themselves for more volatility and headline risks ahead.\nMost sectors rose on Tuesday. IT stocks rose nearly 2 percent, while the financial sector gained 1.7 percent. (Reporting by Samuel Shen and John Ruwitch; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)\n ",
