    "text": "Denard Span, Wilson Ramos, Carlos Gomez and Johnny Field all homered Saturday as the Tampa Bay Rays won their eighth straight game, plastering the Boston Red Sox 12-6 at Fenway Park in Boston.\nScoring in every inning but the first and fourth, Tampa Bay finished with a total of 18 hits in its latest offensive onslaught. The Rays have scored a whopping 63 runs in their hot stretch, plating eight runs or more in six different games.\nTampa Bay snapped a 5-5 tie in the sixth when second baseman Eduardo Nunez committed a throwing error after Matt Duffy’s infield single, enabling Adeiny Hechavarria to score.\nThe Rays played add-on from that point. Gomez led off the seventh with a long homer to left over the Green Monster, his fourth of the year. Jesus Sucre upped the lead to 8-5 in the eighth with an RBI double.\nTampa Bay made it a rout in the ninth with four more runs. Brad Miller knocked in Span with a single and Field lofted a three-run shot just over the wall in left for his first major league homer.\nRyan Yarbrough (1-1) pitched four innings of relief for his first big league victory. He permitted three hits and two runs, walking none and fanning six. Starter Yonny Chirinos lasted only two-plus innings, yielding six hits and three runs with two walks and three strikeouts.\nDavid Price (2-3) was tagged with the loss after a shaky 5 2/3 innings. Price gave up eight hits and six runs, five of them earned, walking four and whiffing five.\nStaked to a 1-0 edge after Xander Bogaerts’ sacrifice fly in the first, Price ran into problems with the long ball. Span’s liner to right-center field eluded Jackie Bradley Jr. with Ramos aboard. The play was originally scored a hit and an error but was changed to an inside-the-park homer, the second of Span’s career.\nRamos touched Price for a two-run shot in the third, his fourth of the year. Price also walked Daniel Robertson with the bases loaded in the fifth.\nRafael Devers cracked a solo shot for the Red Sox, finishing the day 3-for-5 with two RBIs.\nRed Sox leadoff man Mookie Betts left the game in the top of the fifth inning with right hamstring tightness and is day-to-day, the team announced. Meanwhile, the Rays removed Ramos after a long single in the top of the seventh with bilateral leg tightness. He, too, is day-to-day.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
