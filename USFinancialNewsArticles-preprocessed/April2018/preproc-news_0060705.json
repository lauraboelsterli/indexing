Slideshow (7 Images)\n“We have to deal with it and we will deal with it. The players need a lift and we will give them that. We had good momentum. We will fight until the final end.”\nHuddersfield dictated the pace in the opening half of a scrappy affair but Everton always looked more likely to break the deadlock. Tosun fired them ahead in the 39th minute with a fine finish from 18 metres after good work by Theo Walcott.\nThe visitors missed two good chances to double their advantage in the second half before Gueye silenced the noisy home crowd with a superb shot from 20 metres which gave the home keeper Jonas Loessl no chance.\nEverton manager Sam Allardyce, who came under fire from the visiting fans, praised his team.\n“It was an excellent performance,” he said. “Huddersfield at home have been strong and they were looking to make themselves safe by beating us but we were too good for them.\n“It’s a good win and that’s 11 points in six games. We are riding high and are finishing the season strongly... we shouldn’t keep talking about critics.” Writing by Zoran Milosavljevic; Editing by Christian Radnedge and Pritha Sarkar",
