In the first quarter of 2018, we incurred $1.0 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in incremental provisional income tax expense related to the TCJA.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please refer to the \"Supplemental Financial Information\" tables provided in this press release.\nColumbia Sportswear Company (NASDAQ: COLM) today announced record net sales of $607.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, an increase of 12 percent (8 percent constant-currency), compared with net sales of $543.8 million for the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net sales of $599.0 million increased 10 percent (7 percent constant-currency).\nFirst quarter 2018 net income increased 25 percent to a record $45.1 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, compared with first quarter 2017 net income of $36.0 million, or $0.51 per diluted share. Non-GAAP first quarter 2018 net income increased 48 percent to $54.5 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, compared with non-GAAP first quarter 2017 net income of $36.9 million, or $0.52 per diluted share.\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer Tim Boyle commented, \"We are pleased to report better than expected first quarter net sales and profitability led by strength in our direct-to-consumer (\"DTC\") businesses, growth in our wholesale businesses, including a return to growth in U.S. wholesale, and the favorable effect of strengthening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Gross margin exceeded expectations, and we maintained SG&A discipline while continuing to invest in our strategic priorities.\"\n\"We are also pleased to increase our full year 2018 financial outlook as a result of better than expected first quarter net sales and profitability, higher than initially planned Fall 2018 advance wholesale orders, including continued improvement in U.S. wholesale net sales across all of our brands, and the favorable effect of strengthening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. When considering our plans for the balance of the year, we have made the decision to accelerate investment in our strategic priorities.\"\n\"First quarter 2018 net sales and earnings results, as well as healthy advance orders for Fall 2018 across our regions demonstrate the power of our global brands and our initiatives to become a more brand-led and consumer-focused organization. Our powerful balance sheet, with $808.2 million in cash and short-term investments, and no long-term debt, provides the flexibility to invest in the business as our major markets evolve. It is from this position of strength and confidence that we are accelerating investment in our strategic priorities to:\ndrive brand awareness and sales growth through increased, focused demand creation investments; enhance consumer experience and digital capabilities in all our channels and geographies; expand and improve global direct-to-consumer operations with supporting processes and systems; and invest in our people and optimize our organization across our portfolio of brands.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\n(All comparisons are between first quarter 2018 and first quarter 2017, unless otherwise noted).\nNet Sales\nFirst quarter 2018 consolidated net sales increased 12 percent (8 percent constant-currency) to a record $607.3 million. Non-GAAP net sales increased 10 percent (7 percent constant-currency) to $599.0 million.\nGeographies (See \"Geographical Net Sales\" table below)\nU.S. net sales increased 9 percent, attributable to high-teens percent growth in DTC and low-single-digit percent growth in wholesale. The company operated 130 U.S. retail stores at March 31, 2018 compared with 120 at the same time last year. Latin America Asia Pacific (\"LAAP\") net sales increased 11 percent (5 percent constant-currency) primarily due to the effect of the new revenue accounting standard. LAAP non-GAAP net sales increased 4 percent (2 percent decrease constant-currency) driven by growth in Japan, China, and Korea, partially offset by declines in LAAP distributor net sales. Europe Middle East and Africa (\"EMEA\") net sales increased 30 percent (15 percent constant-currency) primarily driven by low-30 percent growth (mid-teens percent constant-currency) in Europe-direct and modest growth with EMEA distributors. Canada net sales increased 11 percent (6 percent constant-currency), largely driven by DTC.\nBrands (See \"Brand Net Sales\" table below)\nColumbia brand net sales increased 13 percent (10 percent constant-currency) to $508.8 million. SOREL brand net sales increased 13 percent (10 percent constant-currency) to $30.8 million. prAna brand net sales increased 9 percent to $42.3 million. Mountain Hardwear brand net sales decreased 12 percent (14 percent decrease constant-currency) to $24.4 million.\nProduct Categories (See \"Product Category Net Sales\" table below)\nApparel, Accessories and Equipment net sales increased 11 percent (9 percent constant-currency) to $490.0 million. Footwear net sales increased 13 percent (8 percent constant-currency) to $117.3 million.\nChannels (See \"Channel Net Sales\" table below)\nWholesale net sales increased 5 percent (1 percent constant-currency) to $343.9 million. DTC net sales increased 23 percent (20 percent constant-currency) to $263.4 million.\nProfitability\nRecord first quarter 2018 operating income of $59.3 million, or 9.8 percent of net sales, increased 24 percent compared to operating income of $48.0 million, or 8.8 percent of net sales, in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP first quarter 2018 operating income increased 43 percent to $70.3 million, or 11.7 percent of net sales, compared to non-GAAP operating income of $49.3 million, or 9.1 percent of net sales, in the first quarter of 2017.\nRecord first quarter 2018 net income increased 25 percent to $45.1 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, compared with net income of $36.0 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP first quarter 2018 net income increased 48 percent to $54.5 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, compared with non-GAAP net income of $36.9 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017.\nTaxes\nFirst quarter 2018 income tax expense was $12.6 million, resulting in an effective income tax rate of 20.6 percent, compared to $9.8 million, or 20.1 percent, in the first quarter of 2017.\nExcluding a $2.6 million income tax benefit associated with Project CONNECT and $1.0 million in provisional income tax expense associated with the TCJA, non-GAAP first quarter 2018 income tax expense was $14.2 million, resulting in an effective income tax rate of 19.6 percent.\nExcluding a $0.4 million income tax benefit associated with Project CONNECT, first quarter 2017 non-GAAP income tax expense was $10.2 million, resulting in an effective income tax rate of 20.4 percent.\nBalance Sheet\nAt March 31, 2018, cash and short-term investments totaled $808.2 million, compared to $590.5 million at March 31, 2017.\nThe enactment of the TCJA and the resulting change to a territorial taxation system provides us with significantly more flexibility to repatriate foreign cash, and as a result we were able to repatriate $219.6 million of foreign cash to the United States in early April 2018.\nConsolidated inventories increased 2 percent to $406.0 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $398.8 million at March 31, 2017, including an $18.2 million decrease driven by a balance sheet reclassification of the estimated cost of inventory associated with sales returns into prepaid and other current assets under the new revenue accounting standard. Excluding the impact of this classification change, consolidated inventories increased 6 percent compared to March 31, 2017.\nCash Flow, Share Repurchases and Dividends\nOperating cash flow for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $77.4 million, compared to $88.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nCapital expenditures totaled $12.3 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $11.3 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the company repurchased 235,497 shares of common stock for $18.1 million, or an average of $76.84 per share, and paid $15.5 million in dividends.\nAt March 31, 2018, approximately $119.8 million remained available under the current stock repurchase authorization, which does not obligate the company to acquire any specific number of shares or to acquire shares over any specified period of time.\nThe board of directors authorized a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share, payable on May 31, 2018 to shareholders of record on May 17, 2018.\nUpdated Full Year 2018 Financial Outlook\nAll projections related to anticipated future results are forward-looking in nature and are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ, perhaps materially. Projections are predicated on normal seasonal weather globally. In addition, our updated full year 2018 financial outlook assumes that current macroeconomic and market conditions in key markets do not worsen.\nThe company's annual net sales are weighted more heavily toward the Fall/Winter season, while operating expenses are more equally distributed throughout the year, resulting in a highly seasonal profitability pattern weighted toward the second half of the year.\nThe company currently expects 2018 net sales growth of approximately 8.0 to 10.0 percent (prior 5.5 to 7.5 percent), compared with 2017 net sales of $2.47 billion. The company expects non-GAAP net sales growth of approximately 6.5 to 8.5 percent (prior 4.0 to 6.0 percent) which excludes approximately $40 million in net sales associated with the new revenue accounting standard.\nThe company expects full year 2018 gross margin to improve by up to 140 basis points and non-GAAP gross margin to improve by up to 60 basis points, excluding an approximately $40 million benefit to gross profit associated with the new revenue accounting standard.\nThe company expects SG&A expenses to increase at a rate faster than net sales, resulting in approximately 150 to 170 basis points of SG&A expense deleverage (prior 170 to 190 basis points), and non-GAAP SG&A expense deleverage of approximately 30 to 50 basis points (prior 40 to 50 basis points), excluding approximately $40 million in SG&A expenses associated with the new revenue accounting standard, and approximately $23 million (prior $27 million) in Project CONNECT program expenses and discrete costs.\nBased on the above assumptions, the company expects 2018 operating income between approximately $275 million and $285 million (prior between $263 million and $273 million), and non-GAAP operating income between approximately $299 million and $308 million (prior between $290 million and $300 million), resulting in operating margin between approximately 10.3 and 10.5 percent (prior between 10.1 and 10.3 percent), and non-GAAP operating margin between approximately 11.4 and 11.5 percent (prior between 11.3 and 11.5 percent).\nThe changes in revenue and expense classification associated with the new revenue accounting standard are expected to have a 15 to 20 basis point negative effect on reported operating margin rate for 2018, but no effect on reported operating income.\nThe company expects an estimated full-year effective income tax rate of approximately 22 percent, which reflects a lower U.S. federal statutory income tax rate as a result of the TCJA and may be materially affected by further refinement of the company's 2017 TCJA provisional estimates as well as changes in the company's geographic mix of pre-tax income and other discrete events that may occur during the year.\nThe company expects 2018 net income between approximately $213 million and $220 million (prior between $203 million and $211 million), and non-GAAP net income between approximately $231 million and $238 million (prior between $224 million and $231 million), or diluted earnings per share between approximately $3.01 and $3.11 (prior between $2.88 and $2.98), and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $3.27 and $3.37 (prior between $3.17 and $3.27).\nWith respect to our 2018 financial outlook, non-GAAP financial measures exclude net sales of approximately $40 million, with an offsetting increase in SG&A expenses of approximately $40 million associated with the new revenue accounting standard, as well as Project CONNECT program expenses and discrete costs of approximately $23 million, $18 million net of tax, or $0.25 per diluted share (prior $27 million, $21 million net of tax, or $0.29 per diluted share). In the first quarter of 2018, we incurred $1.0 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in incremental provisional income tax expense related to the TCJA.\nCFO's Commentary on First Quarter 2018 Financial Results and Updated Full Year 2018 Financial Outlook Available Online\nAt approximately 4:15 p.m. ET today, a commentary by Jim Swanson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, reviewing the company's first quarter 2018 financial results and updated full year 2018 financial outlook will be furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (The \"SEC\") on Form 8-K and published on the company's website at http://investor.columbia.com/results.cfm . Analysts and investors are encouraged to review this commentary prior to participating in the conference call.\nConference Call\nThe company will host a conference call on Thursday, April 26, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. ET to review its first quarter 2018 financial results and updated full year 2018 financial outlook.

Following issuance of the earnings release, a commentary reviewing the company's second quarter and year to date financial results will be furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K and published on the investor relations section of the company's website at http://investor.columbia.com/results.cfm . A public webcast of Columbia's earnings conference call will follow at 5:00 p.m. ET at www.columbia.com .\nSupplemental Financial Information\nSince Columbia Sportswear Company is a global company, the comparability of its operating results reported in U.S. dollars is affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because the underlying currencies in which it transacts change in value over time compared to the U.S. dollar. To supplement financial information reported in accordance with GAAP, the company discloses constant-currency net sales information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, to provide a framework to assess how the business performed excluding the effects of changes in the exchange rates used to translate net sales generated in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. The company calculates constant-currency net sales by translating net sales in foreign currencies for the current period into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates that were in effect during the comparable period of the prior year. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure reflects an additional and useful way of viewing an aspect of our operations that, when viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results, provides a more comprehensive understanding of our business and operations. In particular, investors may find the non-GAAP measures useful by reviewing our net sales results without the volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. This non-GAAP financial measure also facilitates management's internal comparisons to our historical net sales results and comparisons to competitors' net sales results.\nAdditionally, this document includes references to other non-GAAP financial measures that exclude increased net sales and gross profit, and offsetting increased SG&A expenses, associated with the new revenue accounting standard, as well as program expenses, discrete costs and associated tax effects related to Project CONNECT and TCJA-related income tax expense. The related tax effects of program expenses and discrete costs related to Project CONNECT were calculated using the respective statutory tax rates for applicable jurisdictions. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable useful and meaningful comparisons of our operating performance from period to period because they exclude the effects of the aforementioned items above that may not be indicative of our core operating results.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures, including constant-currency net sales, should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, our financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The company provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. See \"Supplemental Financial Information\" tables included below. The non-GAAP financial measures and constant-currency information presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis document contains within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding anticipated results, net sales and net sales growth, gross margin, operating expenses, licensing income, operating income, operating margins, net income, earnings per share, income tax rates and the effects of tax reform (including the TCJA), SG&A expenses, including deleverage and SG&A expenses associated with the new revenue accounting standard, and Project CONNECT program expenses and discrete costs, projected growth or decline in specific geographies, channels, products, and brands, the effect of changes associated with the new revenue accounting standard on our financial results, the effects of foreign currency, inventory growth, share repurchase activity, capital expenditures, investment activity, operating cash flow, the performance of our China joint venture and investments in our business in China, including the planned buyout of the 40 percent non-controlling interest in the joint venture, and our ability to adapt our business and realize the anticipated benefits of our investments in our strategic priorities. Forward-looking statements often use words such as \"will\", \"anticipate\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"should\", \"may\" and other words and terms of similar meaning or reference future dates. The company's expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith and are believed to have a reasonable basis; however, each forward-looking statement involves a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in this document, those described in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q under the heading \"Risk Factors,\" and those that have been or may be described in other reports filed by the company, including reports on Form 8-K. Potential risks and uncertainties that may affect our future revenues, earnings and performance and could cause the actual results of operations or financial condition of the company to differ materially from the anticipated results expressed or implied by in this document include: loss of key customer accounts; our ability to effectively implement IT infrastructure and business process initiatives and to maintain the strength and security of our IT systems; the effects of unseasonable weather, including global climate change; trends affecting consumer traffic and spending in DTC; our ability to implement our growth strategy; unfavorable economic conditions generally, the financial health of our customers and changes in the level of consumer spending, apparel preferences and fashion trends; changes in international, federal or state tax, labor and other laws and regulations that affect our business, including changes in corporate tax rates, tariffs, international trade policy, or increasing wage rates; the effects of the TCJA, including related changes to our tax obligations and effective tax rate in future periods, as well as future changes to related provisional tax expense recorded in 2017; volatility in global production and transportation costs and capacity; risks inherent in doing business in foreign markets, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates; our ability to attract and retain key personnel; risks associated with our joint venture, including the planned buyout of the non-controlling 40 percent interest in the joint venture; higher than expected rates of order cancellations; increased consolidation of our wholesale customers; our ability to effectively source and deliver our products to customers in a timely manner; our dependence on independent manufacturers and suppliers and our ability to source finished products and components at competitive prices from them; the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts; intense competition in the industry; business disruptions and acts of terrorism, cyber-attacks or military activities around the globe; our ability to establish and protect our intellectual property; the seasonality of our business; and our ability to develop innovative products. The company cautions that are inherently less reliable than historical information. The company does not undertake any duty to update any of the after the date of this document to conform them to actual results or to reflect changes in events, circumstances or its expectations. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for the company to predict or assess the effects of all such factors or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.\nAbout Columbia Sportswear Company\nColumbia Sportswear Company has assembled a portfolio of brands for active lives, making it a leader in the global active lifestyle apparel, footwear, accessories, and equipment industry.

As such, the March 31, 2018 accounts receivable and accrued liabilities balances include a gross-up of $56,768 reflecting this change.\n(2) In conjunction with the adoption of ASC 606, the estimated cost of inventory associated with sales returns reserves is now presented within prepaid expenses and other current assets rather than Inventories. As a result, the March 31, 2018 balance sheet reflects a decrease of $18,175 in inventories and a directly offsetting increase of $18,175 in prepaid expenses and other current assets.\nCOLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net sales $ 607,308 $ 543,793 Cost of sales 307,870 285,326 Gross profit 299,438 258,467 49.3 % 47.5 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 243,368 212,815 Net licensing income 3,251 2,353 Income from operations 59,321 48,005 Interest income, net 2,296 955 Interest expense on note payable to related party — (249 ) Other non-operating expense, net (268 ) (53 ) Income before income tax 61,349 48,658 Income tax expense (12,620 ) (9,773 ) Net income 48,729 38,885 Net income attributable to non-controlling interest 3,622 2,879 Net income attributable to Columbia Sportswear Company $ 45,107 $ 36,006 Earnings per share attributable to Columbia Sportswear Company: Basic $ 0.64 $ 0.52 Diluted $ 0.64 $ 0.51 Weighted average shares outstanding: Basic 70,080 69,606 Diluted 70,843 70,414 COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(In thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Cash flows from operating activities: Net income $ 48,729 $ 38,885 Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities: Depreciation and amortization 14,536 14,940 Loss on disposal and impairment of property, plant, and equipment 20 160 Deferred income taxes 3,252 4,426 Stock-based compensation 3,113 2,941 Changes in operating assets and liabilities: Accounts receivable 115,414 76,619 Inventories 32,133 94,487 Prepaid expenses and other current assets (1,912 ) (2,139 ) Other assets (2,340 ) 1,336 Accounts payable (87,492 ) (122,824 ) Accrued liabilities (45,000 ) (18,961 ) Income taxes payable (6,038 ) (1,738 ) Other liabilities 2,937 97 Net cash provided by operating activities 77,352 88,229 Cash flows from investing activities: Purchases of short-term investments (33,178 ) (33,813 ) Sales of short-term investments 37,121 0 Capital expenditures (12,290 ) (11,275 ) Proceeds from sale of property, plant, and equipment 19 27 Net cash used in investing activities (8,328 ) (45,061 ) Cash flows from financing activities: Proceeds from credit facilities — 400 Repayments on credit facilities — (400 ) Proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans 9,380 7,791 Tax payments related to restricted stock unit issuances (4,033 ) (3,513 ) Repurchase of common stock (18,099 ) (33,000 ) Cash dividends paid (15,452 ) (12,499 ) Net cash used in financing activities (28,204 ) (41,221 ) Net effect of exchange rate changes on cash 3,230 2,670 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 44,050 4,617 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 673,166 551,389 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 717,216 $ 556,006 Supplemental disclosures of non-cash investing and financing activities : Capital expenditures incurred but not yet paid $ 4,000 $ 4,206 COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY\nSupplemental Financial Information\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 GAAP\nMeasures\n(As Reported)\nAdjust for\nProject\nCONNECT\nCosts (1)\nAdjust for\nEffects of\nASC 606 (2)\nAdjust for\nEffects of the\nTCJA (3)\nNon-GAAP\nMeasures\nNet sales $ 607,308 $ — $ (8,257 ) $ — $ 599,051 Cost of sales 307,870 — — — 307,870 Gross profit 299,438 — (8,257 ) — 291,181 Selling, general and administrative expenses 243,368 (10,994 ) (8,257 ) — 224,117 Net licensing income 3,251 — — — 3,251 Income from operations 59,321 10,994 — — 70,315 Non-operating income, net 2,028 — — — 2,028 Income before income tax 61,349 10,994 — — 72,343 Income tax expense (12,620 ) (2,617 ) — 1,043 (14,194 ) Net income 48,729 8,377 — 1,043 58,149 Net income attributable to non-controlling interest 3,622 — — — 3,622 Net income attributable to Columbia Sportswear Company $ 45,107 $ 8,377 $ — $ 1,043 $ 54,527 Earnings per share attributable to Columbia Sportswear Company: Basic $ 0.64 $ 0.78 Diluted 0.64 0.77 Weighted average shares outstanding: Basic 70,080 70,080 Diluted 70,843 70,843 (1) Amounts reflect professional fees, severance and other program expenses related to Project CONNECT that the company believes are incremental to the company's ongoing operations.

As such, the company's non-GAAP measures exclude the resulting revenue gross-up and offsetting increase in selling, general and administrative expenses resulting from the adoption ASC 606 to enable meaningful comparisons of our operating performance compared to fiscal year 2017.\n(3) Amounts reflect an incremental provisional TCJA-related tax expense of $1.0 million, resulting from the issuance of additional clarifying guidance, which drove further refinement of the company's provisional estimates that were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCOLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY\nSupplemental Financial Information\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2017 GAAP\nMeasures\n(As Reported)\nAdjust for\nProject\nCONNECT\nCosts (1)\nNon-GAAP\nMeasures\nNet sales $ 543,793 $ — $ 543,793 Cost of sales 285,326 — 285,326 Gross profit 258,467 — 258,467 Selling, general and administrative expenses 212,815 (1,293 ) 211,522 Net licensing income 2,353 — 2,353 Income from operations 48,005 1,293 49,298 Non-operating income, net 653 — 653 Income before income tax 48,658 1,293 49,951 Income tax expense (9,773 ) (434 ) (10,207 ) Net income 38,885 859 39,744 Net income attributable to non-controlling interest 2,879 — 2,879 Net income attributable to Columbia Sportswear Company $ 36,006 $ 859 $ 36,865 Earnings per share attributable to Columbia Sportswear Company: Basic $ 0.52 $ 0.53 Diluted 0.51 0.52 Weighted average shares outstanding: Basic 69,606 69,606 Diluted 70,414 70,414 (1) Amounts reflect professional fees and other program expenses related to Project CONNECT that the company believes are incremental to our ongoing operations.
