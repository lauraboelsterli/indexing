    "text": "SAN RAMON, Calif. (AP) _ Chevron Corp. (CVX) on Friday reported first-quarter earnings of $3.64 billion.\nOn a per-share basis, the San Ramon, California-based company said it had net income of $1.90.\nThe results surpassed Wall Street expectations, but Chevron does not adjust its reported results based on one-time events such as asset sales. The average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $1.45 per share.\nThe oil company posted revenue of $37.76 billion in the period, falling short of Street forecasts. Three analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $38.74 billion.\nChevron shares have declined roughly 1 percent since the beginning of the year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index has stayed nearly flat. The stock has risen 17 percent in the last 12 months.\nThis story was generated by Automated Insights ( http://automatedinsights.com/ap ) using data from Zacks Investment Research.
