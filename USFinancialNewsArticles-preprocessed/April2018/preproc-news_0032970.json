    "text": "WILLIMANTIC, Conn., SI Financial Group, Inc. (the “Company”) (NASDAQ:SIFI), the holding company of Savings Institute Bank and Trust Company (the “Bank”), reported net income of $2.0 million, or $0.17 diluted earnings per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 versus $1.7 million, or $0.14 diluted earnings per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nNet interest income increased $427,000 to $10.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $10.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, primarily as a result of increases in the average balance of loans and average yield earned on loans and other interest-earning assets and a reduction in the average balance of FHLB advances, partially offset by increases in the average balance of deposits and in the average rates paid on deposits and borrowings. The increase in yields reflects the rising interest rate environment.\nThe provision for loan losses increased $565,000 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to increases in nonperforming loans, reserves for impaired loans and an increase in commercial real estate loans, which carry a higher degree of risk than other loans held in the loan portfolio. At March 31, 2018, nonperforming loans increased to $7.9 million compared to $5.0 million at March 31, 2017, resulting from increases in nonperforming multi-family and commercial real estate of $2.7 million and commercial business loans of $550,000, offset by a decrease of $315,000 in nonperforming residential real estate loans. Net loan charge-offs were $55,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to net loan recoveries of $20,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nNoninterest income decreased $115,000 to $2.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $2.5 million for the same period in the prior year, due to a decrease in wealth management fees of $318,000 resulting from the sale of the Company's trust and asset management business in May 2017. The cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance, mortgage banking fees and service fees increased $85,000, $59,000 and $28,000, respectively, during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter in 2017.\nNoninterest expenses decreased $291,000 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to fraudulent debit card transactions of $373,000 that occurred in the first quarter of 2017. Computer and electronic banking expenses decreased $92,000 for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 versus the comparable period in 2017 as a result of reconfiguration of the telecommunication infrastructure and contract renegotiations with a third party provider. Outside professional services decreased $45,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 versus the same period in 2017 due to decreases in legal and consulting expenses. Regulatory assessments decreased $21,000 for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 as a result of a lower FDIC assessment rate. Occupancy expense increased $75,000 primarily due to higher snow removal costs.\nTotal assets increased $17.4 million, or 1.1%, to $1.60 billion at March 31, 2018, principally due to an increase of $26.0 million in net loans receivable, offset by a decrease of $8.6 million in available for sale securities. The higher balance of net loans receivable reflects increases of $39.3 million, $1.6 million and $1.3 million in multi-family and commercial real estate loans, residential mortgage loans and construction loans, respectively, offset by decreases of $9.2 million, $3.1 million, $2.5 million and $1.8 million in SBA and USDA guaranteed loans, timeshare loans, consumer loans and other commercial business loans, respectively. Multi-family and commercial real estate originations increased $42.5 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. Commercial business loan originations and residential real estate loans decreased $8.2 million and $4.5 million, respectively, during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.\nTotal liabilities increased $16.9 million, or 1.2%, to $1.43 billion at March 31, 2018 compared to $1.41 billion at December 31, 2017, primarily due to increases in deposits of $14.5 million, or 1.2%, which included increases in NOW and money market accounts of $19.1 million and certificates of deposit of $6.0 million, offset by decreases in noninterest-bearing deposits of $9.2 million and savings accounts of $1.6 million. Although market competition has intensified, deposit growth remained strong due to marketing and promotional initiatives and competitively-priced deposit products. Borrowings increased $3.6 million from $178.3 million at December 31, 2017 to $181.9 million at March 31, 2018, which were used to fund the growth in commercial lending.\nTotal shareholders' equity increased $438,000 from $168.5 million at December 31, 2017 to $168.9 million at March 31, 2018. The increase in shareholders' equity was primarily attributable to net income of $2.0 million, partially offset by an increase of $1.1 million in unrealized losses on securities included in other comprehensive income and dividends paid of $716,000. At March 31, 2018, the Bank’s regulatory capital exceeded the amounts required for the Bank to be considered “well-capitalized” under applicable regulatory capital guidelines.\n“We are pleased with the success we have had implementing our business plan of growing the loan portfolio and deposits by expanding our lending and deposit gathering resources. In addition, we continue to focus on increasing our core noninterest income while prudently reducing noninterest expenses,\" commented Rheo A. Brouillard, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nSI Financial Group, Inc. is the holding company for Savings Institute Bank and Trust Company. Established in 1842, Savings Institute Bank and Trust Company is a community-oriented financial institution headquartered in Willimantic, Connecticut.
