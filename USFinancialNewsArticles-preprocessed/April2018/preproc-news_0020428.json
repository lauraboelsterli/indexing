    "text": "April 11, 2018 / 7:59 AM / Updated an hour ago Ipswich name Klug as caretaker manager Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Ipswich Town have appointed head of coaching and player development Bryan Klug as caretaker manager following Mick McCarthy’s departure, the Championship (second-tier) club said on Wednesday. \nMcCarthy announced his exit shortly after Tuesday’s 1-0 win over Barnsley, leaving the Suffolk club four games earlier than his planned exit at the end of the campaign. \nKlug will be in charge for the remaining four matches of the Championship season, starting at the City Ground against Nottingham Forest on Saturday. \nIpswich, currently 12th in the league table, have struggled for consistency this season and are 12 points adrift of the playoff spots but are not in danger of relegation.
