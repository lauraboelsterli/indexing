Based in New York, Mr. Slorer will report into Matt Clark, Chief Operating Officer, BTIG Investment Banking , and Charles Mather, CFA, Co-Head of Equity Capital Markets and Head of Capital Markets Origination .\nAt BTIG, Mr. Slorer will focus on the origination and execution of energy and shipping-specific transactions for corporate clients. “Ole will significantly bolster our banking capabilities,” said Scott Kovalik, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of BTIG . “His global perspective, important relationships, and ability to connect with company management teams will be increasingly valuable to our clients and their business objectives.”\nMr. Slorer has close to 30 years of energy and shipping expertise. Prior to BTIG, he was a Managing Director, and Energy and Shipping Equity Research Analyst at Morgan Stanley, where he held roles in London and New York, and spent a majority of his career. Previously, Mr. Slorer was an Executive Director and Equity Research Analyst at NatWest Markets, where he remained for nearly a decade. He has received numerous recognitions for his work including being named a #1 Research Analyst in his sector by Institutional Investor’s 2010, 2011 and 2012 All-America Research Team Surveys, and top rankings in a variety of U.S. and European-based surveys conducted by Greenwich Associates, Extel, The Wall Street Journal/NASDAQ and Reuters.\n“We are pleased to welcome Ole to the firm,” noted Mr. Clark . “He will play a critical role in enhancing our banking platform to meet our clients’ advisory, tactical and transactional needs. As an energy and shipping expert, he will offer differentiated insight into the space and help clients navigate the landscape.”\nBTIG’s Investment Banking effort continues to gain traction in facilitating advisory services for growth-oriented companies. In the last two years, the firm has executed more than 180 transactions across the consumer, energy, financials, healthcare, real estate, shipping, and technology, media and telecommunications sectors. “Ole will further expand our banking presence, and will lead our push into energy and shipping,” said Mr. Mather . “We look forward to bringing the benefits of a BTIG relationship to clients focused on these sectors.”\nBTIG experienced a significant increase in its deal flow during the second half of 2017, which has also carried over into 2018.
