    "text": "LITCHFIELD PARK, Ariz., April 26, 2018 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The Financial Planning Association® (FPA®) and the CFP Board Center for Financial Planning announced the Richard B. (Dick) Wagner Memorial Scholarship Fund, a joint effort to advance and diversify the CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ professional workforce.\nThe scholarship was announced at FPA Retreat 2018 in Litchfield Park, Ariz. It honors the memory of Dick Wagner, who held the CFP® certification and was a well-known thought leader in the financial planning community with a passion for building the financial planning profession and empowering younger financial planners to succeed. He passed away in 2017 at age 68.\n\"Dick Wagner was an inspirational thought leader whose passion for financial planning forged a path forward for the profession. His work, guidance and candor has helped so many seasoned and aspiring financial planners,\" says FPA Executive Director/CEO Lauren M. Schadle, CAE. \"This scholarship is just one way we can keep his legacy at the forefront of the profession and in the minds of us who called Dick a friend and colleague. We know this scholarship will play a key role in opening this profession up to the CFP® professionals of tomorrow while also celebrating a man who meant so much to the profession we strive to build.\"\nThe scholarship will be awarded to students seeking to complete a CFP Board-Registered program – either certificate or Baccalaureate program – that would qualify them to sit for the CFP® exam. It is also open to new CFP® professionals desiring to advance their education through key FPA professional development programs, such as the FPA Retreat, Residency, NexGen Gathering, Annual Conference and mentorship opportunities.\nIndividuals eligible for the scholarship must reside in the United States, demonstrate financial need and be part of an under-represented population related to gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, individuals 35 and under or those with disabilities.\n\"Dick was a tireless advocate for the financial planning profession, and this scholarship fund truly reflects the legacy that he left for all of us,\" said Marilyn Mohrman-Gillis, CFP Board Center for Financial Planning executive director. \"It is our privilege to join with FPA in establishing this fund to continue Dick's efforts to cultivate the next generation of competent and ethical financial planner professionals who reflect the diversity of the American population we seek to serve.\"\nThose interested in donating to the Richard B. Wagner Memorial Scholarship Fund can do so here . The program will begin accepting applications from new and prospective CFP® professionals early in 2019.\nABOUT CFP BOARD\nThe mission of Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Inc. is to benefit the public by granting the CFP® certification and upholding it as the recognized standard of excellence for competent and ethical personal financial planning.
