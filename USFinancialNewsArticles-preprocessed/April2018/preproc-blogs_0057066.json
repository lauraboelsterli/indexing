    "text": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese video game maker Nintendo Co said on Friday it has teamed up with Tokyo-based online games developer Cygames Inc, aiming to step up the mobile gaming business and reduce reliance on volatile console sales.\nThe Nintendo booth is shown at the E3 2017 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 13, 2017. REUTERS/ Mike Blake The Kyoto-based company will buy a 5 percent stake in unlisted Cygames, known for its blockbuster “Granblue Fantasy” game, for an undisclosed amount.\nAs part of the tie-up, Nintendo will release a jointly developed action role-playing game called “Dragalia Lost” for smartphones this summer, Nintendo said.\nThe game will be launched in Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau at first, and later in North America and Europe.\nNintendo entered mobile gaming under partnership with online gaming firm DeNA Co in 2015 as part of an effort to stabilize earnings highly dependent on its volatile games console business.\nIt has since released several mobile gaming titles including Super Mario Run, using its popular Super Mario Bros characters.\nReporting by Makiko Yamazaki; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier\n ",
