    "text": "April 17, 2018 / 2:17 PM / Updated 19 minutes ago M&S to close Hardwick distribution centre, affecting 450 jobs Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Marks & Spencer ( MKS.L ) said it would close its Hardwick distribution centre in north-west England, where 450 contractors supply clothing and home products to its stores in the north west and Scotland. A branch of retail store Marks & Spencer is seen in central London April 6, 2011. REUTERS/Toby Melville \nThe British retailer said the site would cease operations in September, with work transferring to other centres, including one in Bradford that it is automating. Its contractors XPO Logistics and DHL have started consultations with their Hardwick staff, it said. \nM&S also said it had appointed DHL, owned by Deutsche Post AG ( DPWGn.DE ), to operate its new South East distribution centre at Welham Green. \nThe centre, which was announced in January, will open in 2019, M&S said, adding that DHL will recruit around 500 people to work at the site.
