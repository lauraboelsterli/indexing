    "text": "1 COMMENTS Anthem ’s ANTM -2.64% patience is going to pay off.\nTalks between Walmart and health insurer Humana , HUM -1.90% if successful, would be the latest in a string of splashy deals in the insurance sector.\nPharmacy chain CVS Health has announced it plans to buy Aetna , while Cigna has plans to purchase the pharmacy-benefits manager Express Scripts Holding. The largest publicly traded insurer, UnitedHealth Group , has been bulking up its pharmacy benefit management business for years and has recently bought surgical care centers and physician staffing groups.\nOne reason for insurers to pursue these deals is the difficulty in adding members. They got a rush of new business generated following the adoption of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, but that has now faded.\nOne major insurer that has largely sat out the deal making, aside from some smaller transactions, is Anthem. Given the industry’s expected slowdown in membership growth, that could be interpreted as reason for concern. But Anthem’s status as a laggard actually puts them in a position of strength.\nFor starters, the recent crop of large insurance deals aren’t guaranteed to close successfully; each will face a prolonged regulatory process that will limit capacity for other acquisitions.\nThen there is the matter of successfully integrating these different business combinations. The deals aren’t especially popular with investors, either. CVS , Cigna and Walmart haven’t traded higher since word first emerged on each possible deal. Cigna shares have fallen 13% in about a month.\nBy sitting tight, Anthem has avoided those problems for now, and new CEO Gail Boudreaux has plenty of options to generate growth.\nWith net debt at roughly 35% of total capital, there is plenty of room on Anthem’s balance sheet to bulk up if it chooses to do so. It could, for instance, swallow midsize insurers like WellCare , Molina Healthcare or Centene . That would allow Anthem to expand its membership rolls with a more predictable regulatory process.\nJust as importantly, if its competitors succeed in mustering approval from regulators for vertical deals, then it has no shortage of potential targets. Smaller PBM businesses could help Anthem bulk up its new PBM division, which will launch after its contract with Express Scripts expires. It also could buy a pharmacy chain like Walgreens Boots Alliance or a hospital system, have greater clarity on the regulatory process, and still not be left behind its competitors.\nThat flexibility is currently unmatched among Anthem’s peer group. That should be music to shareholders’ ears.\nWrite to Charley Grant at charles.grant@wsj.com",
