    "text": "EditorsNote: Confirmed stat on White Sox team record tying 4th straight game allowing 10+ runs\nJosh Reddick belted two homers Saturday night, including his second grand slam of April, as the Houston Astros routed the grief-stricken Chicago White Sox 10-1 at Guaranteed Rate Field in Chicago.\nDallas Keuchel (1-3) cruised through six innings, allowing four hits and a run with two walks and six strikeouts to pick up his first win in five starts. It was the fifth straight win for Houston (15-7), which has outscored Seattle and Chicago (4-13) by a whopping 40-5 in that span.\nLucas Giolito (0-3) lost his third straight start, beset by crippling control problems. Giolito walked seven batters in two-plus innings, six of them scoring, and gave up nine runs on five hits with a strikeout. He has passed 19 hitters in 20 innings over four starts.\nIt was the White Sox’s first game since reliever Danny Farquhar collapsed in the dugout during Friday night’s 10-0 loss from a cerebral hemorrhage caused by a ruptured aneurysm. Farquhar’s No. 43 jersey was hung in the Chicago bullpen prior to first pitch.\nHouston touched Giolito for four runs in the first. Carlos Correa started the outburst with an RBI single, followed by Yuli Gurriel’s sacrifice fly. Marwin Gonzalez capped it with a two-run ground-rule double to right-center.\nGiolito passed George Springer, Jose Altuve and Correa in the second to load the bases with nobody out to start the second inning. Reddick then golfed a fastball into the seats in right to make it an 8-0 game.\nAltuve contributed an RBI single in the third, and Reddick finished the Astros’ scoring in the fourth when he took Chris Volstad deep to right-center for his sixth homer of the season.\nTrayce Thompson kept the White Sox from suffering their second straight shutout when he lined a solo homer to right-center in their half of the fifth.\nOther than that and seven innings of one-run relief from its bullpen, nothing else went right for Chicago, which allowed 10 runs or more for the fourth straight game, tying a franchise record.\n—Field Level Media\n 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
