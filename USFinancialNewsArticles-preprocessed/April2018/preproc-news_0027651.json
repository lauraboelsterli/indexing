    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Influential advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) has recommended shareholders vote against the remuneration policy that Unilever ( ULVR.L ) ( UNc.AS ) will put forth at its annual meetings next month.\nThe company logo for Unilever is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., February 17, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo In a report issued late on Friday, the group said there were notable improvements, but concerns about the impact of the consumer goods company moving from a base salary to a consolidated “fixed pay” structure, particularly as a result of increases to fixed pay and the annual bonus potential.\n“On balance, shareholder support is not considered warranted for the remuneration policy,” it said.\nReporting by Martinne Geller; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ",
