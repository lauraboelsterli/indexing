    "text": "NEW YORK, April 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Establishment Labs Holdings Inc., a global medical device company focused on breast aesthetics and reconstruction technologies with a strong emphasis on product development and innovation, announced today that Jeremy Livianu was appointed as General Counsel. He brings more than a decade of legal, compliance and corporate governance experience in the medical technology sector, for both public and private companies.\n“We are delighted to add Jeremy to our leadership team; he brings a wealth of expertise, which I’m confident will serve Establishment Labs well as we continue our global commercialization with differentiated and innovative solutions for breast augmentation and reconstruction,” said Juan Jose Chacon Quiros, CEO and Founder of Establishment Labs. “Managing a global legal infrastructure, as well as complying and exceeding all United States public company reporting standards, will be of great importance as we enter a pivotal stage in our growth.”\nMr. Livianu was most recently Director, Legal Affairs at Nevro Corp, serving as a senior member of the legal team. In addition, he led the compliance and privacy department as well as managed corporate and commercial transactions. He also oversaw securities and corporate governance compliance. Mr. Livianu was also instrumental in preparing the company for its initial public offering, establishing the company’s legal infrastructure, and launching its therapy in the United States following FDA approval. Prior, Mr. Livianu worked at Johnson & Johnson supporting several medical device subsidiaries including surgical aesthetics company Mentor Worldwide. He also served as corporate counsel for Tethys Bioscience, a venture-backed diagnostics company. Previously, Mr. Livianu worked at O’Melveny & Myers LLP and Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker LLP, as part of their intellectual property groups.\n“Leaving Nevro was an incredibly difficult decision, but I have seen what a company can do when it has a truly differentiated product in the medical device sector, and I wanted to be a part of the Establishment Labs story as early on as possible,” Mr. Livianu commented. “ I look forward to guiding the company in both legal and compliance best practices as Establishment Labs sets new standards in breast aesthetics and reconstruction.”\nMr. Livianu received his juris doctorate with honors from The George Washington University Law School and his Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering from the University of California, San Diego.\nAbout Establishment Labs\nEstablishment Labs is a global, privately held, medical technology company with a strong emphasis on innovation that designs, develops, manufactures and markets an innovative product portfolio.
