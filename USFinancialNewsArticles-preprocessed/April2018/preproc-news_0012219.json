The Summit is hosted by the Long Term Quality Alliance (LTQA) and AgingWell Hub at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business.\nThe panel will explore the needs and opportunities involved in developing technologies that support and promote greater cross-sector collaboration for in-home caregiving. The Technology Summit, held April 9-10, will include technology presentations; moderated panel discussions between LTSS providers, consumer advocates, payers, and technology innovators; and participant roundtables that will delve into the issues involved in transforming care - in the home environment- through the development and application of new technologies.\n\"As the U.S. population ages and our nation cares for more medically complex elders, connecting with family caregivers becomes critical to ensure that patients can remain in their homes and communities as long as possible with empowered, knowledgeable support from engaged caregivers,\" said Simon. \"Those of us in the field have a responsibility to arm family caregivers with the information and technology that makes their work easier and gives them all necessary support to care for loved ones effectively.\"\nSimon will join the panel discussion featuring executives from companies/organizations such as CareGeneral, ClearCare, SEIU, Aging 2.0, Daughterhood, AUCD, and Anthem.\nMore information about the \"Technology Summit: Transforming the Experience of Care in the Home\" event can be found at www.ltqa.org/upcoming-technology-summit-transforming-the-experience-of-care-in-the-home .
