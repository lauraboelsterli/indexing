    "text": "ALPENA, Mich., April 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- First Federal of Northern Michigan Bancorp, Inc. (OTCQX: FFNM) (the \"Company\") reported consolidated net earnings of $396,000, or $0.11 per basic share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to consolidated net earnings of $390,000, or $0.10 per basic share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Annualized return on average assets was 0.50% and return on average equity was 4.84% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 0.45% and 4.67%, respectively for the prior year period.\nThe Company's results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 include:\nProvision for loan losses resulted in income of $84,000 as compared to expense of $87,000 for the prior year period. Quarter over quarter increase of $192,000, or 49.0%, in the Company's non-interest income with the deposit premium received in relation to the sale of deposits and certain loans in the Oscoda market. One-time expenses totaling $202,000 related to the merger with Mackinac Financial Corporation. Tangible book value per share at March 31, 2018 was $8.49 compared to $8.78 at March 31, 2017.\nWhen comparing our results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 to the three months ended March 31, 2017, net interest income, after provision, increased $194,000, or 8.1%, to $2.6 million. Non-interest income increased $192,000, or 49%, to $584,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from $392,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Our non-interest expenses increased $276,000, or 11.5%, to $2.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $2.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nMichael W. Mahler, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented, \"Our focus for the first quarter of 2018 has been on a seamless and efficient merger with Mackinac Financial Corporation. The net income results contain $314,000 in one-time merger related expenses and absent those expenses our net income would have been $710,000 or $0.19 per share.\"\nFinancial Condition\nTotal assets of the Company at March 31, 2018 were $310.5 million, a decrease of $10.8 million, or 3.4%, from $321.2 million at December 31, 2017. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $3.2 million, or 38.2%, and securities available for sale decreased $3.7 million, or 3.8%, to $95.1 million as of March 31, 2018 as compared to $98.8 million as of March 31, 2017. In addition, net loans receivable decreased $2.9 million, or 1.5%, to $188.6 million at March 31, 2018. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the decrease to net loans is primarily attributed to the sale of certain loans assigned to the Oscoda branch.\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\n2018\n2017\nMortgage Loans\n$ 79,964\n$ 83,167\nConsumer Real Estate\n7,217\n7,059\nConsumer Other\n1,406\n1,604\nCommercial Real Estate\n68,855\n72,114\nCommercial Other\n28,131\n29,392\nTotal gross loans\n$ 185,573\n$ 193,336\nLoan Loss Reserve\n(1,782)\n(1,833)\nNet Loans Receivable\n$ 183,791\n$ 191,503\nDeposits decreased $8.5 million, or 3.2%, to $261.8 million at March 31, 2018 from $270.3 million as of December 31, 2017. This decrease is the direct result of the sale of deposits that were held in the Oscoda market. Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances decreased $1.5 million, or 9.3%, as proceeds from loan payments and matured securities were used to pay off maturing advances.\nStockholders' equity decreased $747,000, or 2.3%, to $32.2 million at March 31, 2018 from $32.9 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease was due primarily to net earnings for the three-month period of $396,000 and a reduction of $957,000 in the other comprehensive income component of the unrealized loss on available-for-sale investment securities, offset by a dividend payment of $186,000. At March 31, 2018 First Federal of Northern Michigan remains \"well-capitalized\" for regulatory purposes, as shown in the table below.\nRegulatory\nMinimum to be\nActual\nMinimum *\nWell Capitalized *\nAmount\nRatio\nAmount\nRatio\nAmount\nRatio\nDollars in Thousands\nTier 1 Leverage Capital (tier 1 to quarterly average assets):\n$ 30,559\n9.69%\n$ 12,613\n4.00%\n$ 15,766\n5.00%\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Risk-based Capital ( core capital to risk-weighted assets):\n$ 30,559\n15.88%\n$ 8,658\n4.50%\n$ 12,506\n6.50%\nTier 1 Risk-based Capital (tier 1 to risk-weighted assets):\n$ 30,559\n15.88%\n$ 11,544\n6.00%\n$ 15,392\n8.00%\nTotal Risk-based Capital ( risk-based capital to risk weighted assets):\n$ 32,293\n16.78%\n$ 15,392\n8.00%\n$ 19,240\n10.00%\nTangible Capital (tangible capital to tangible assets):\n$ 30,559\n9.66%\n$ 6,330\n1.50%\n$ 15,824\nN/A\n* The minimum required regulatory ratios do not include the conservation buffer that began on January 1, 2016, which will be fully phased in by January 1, 2019.\nResults of Operations\nInterest income remained unchanged at $2.8 million for the three months ended March 31 2018 and 2017. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, our yield on interest-earning assets increased to 3.73% from 3.43% for the same period in 2017.\nInterest expense decreased to $285,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $307,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in interest expense was due primarily to a $26.7 million average balance decrease in total deposit for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nThe Company's net interest margin increased to 3.34% for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 from 3.04% for the same period in 2017 as a result of the factors mentioned above and the collection of interest income as a long-term non-accrual loan paid off during the quarter.\nThe provision for loan losses for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 resulted in income of $84,000, as compared to expense of $87,000 for the prior year period. The decrease in provision expense quarter over quarter is primarily related to the decline we have experienced in our loan portfolio. The provision was based on management's review of the components of the overall loan portfolio, the status of non-performing loans and other subjective factors.\nNon-interest income increased to $584,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from $392,000 for the 2017 period, primarily due to the $227,000 in deposit premium received on the sale of the deposits and certain loans in the Oscoda market.\nNon-interest expense increased $276,000 to $2.7 million for the 2018 period from $2.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as we experienced decreases in the following areas:\n$203,000 in compensation and employee benefits, primarily a result of one-time accrued expense associated with paid time off, to be paid to employees upon closing of the merger with Mackinac Financial Corporation. $202,000 in professional services, primarily as a result of expenses incurred that relate to our pending merger. Partially offsetting these increases were decreases of $53,000 in collection and real estate owned expenses and $19,000 marketing expenses.\nFederal income tax expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $104,000 compared to no recorded federal income taxes for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nSelect Performance and Financial Statistics (unaudited):\nin thousands (except share data)\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet interest margin\n3.34%\n3.04%\nAverage interest rate spread\n3.21%\n2.93%\nTotal non-performing assets\n$ 2,713\n$ 2,175\nTotal non-performing loans\n$ 2,111\n$ 815\nNon-performing assets to total assets\n0.87%\n0.63%\nNon-performing loans to total loans\n1.12%\n0.44%\nTexas ratio (1)\n8.40%\n7.25%\nClassified asset ratio (2)\n26.15%\n18.39%\nAllowance for loan losses to total loans\n0.92%\n0.96%\nReturn on average assets (3)\n0.50%\n0.45%\nReturn on average equity (3)\n4.84%\n4.67%\nEfficiency ratio (4)\n86.58%\n84.20%\nDividend payout ratio (basic)\n47.06%\n38.22%\nTangible book value per share\n$ 8.49\n$ 8.78\nEarnings per share\n$ 0.11\n$ 0.10\nTotal shares outstanding\n3,726,925\n3,726,925\n(1) Texas Ratio is defined by management as total non-performing assets divided by tangible capital plus loan loss reserves.\n(2) Classified asset ratio is calculated by dividing classified assets (substandard assets plus real estate owned & other repossessed assets) by core capital plus loan loss reserves.\n(3) Annualized.\n(4) Non-interest expense divided by net interest income plus non-interest income, excluding any gains or losses.\nFirst Federal of Northern Michigan Bancorp, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\n(in thousands)\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\n(Unaudited)\nASSETS\nCash and cash equivalents:\nCash on hand and due from banks\n$ 5,185\n$ 7,862\nOvernight deposits with FHLB\n-\n527\nTotal cash and cash equivalents\n5,185\n8,389\nDeposits held in other financial institutions\n3,714\n3,714\nSecurities available for sale\n95,137\n98,839\nSecurities held to maturity\n650\n650\nLoans held for sale\n-\n430\nLoans receivable, net of allowance for loan losses of $1,733,692 and\n$1,833,403 as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively\n188,593\n191,503\nFederal Home Loan Bank stock, at cost\n1,636\n1,636\nPremises and equipment\n5,253\n5,552\nForeclosed real estate and other repossessed assets\n602\n652\nAccrued interest receivable\n1,054\n1,033\nIntangible assets\n593\n635\nDeferred tax asset\n1,842\n1,690\nOriginated mortgage servicing rights\n398\n418\nBank owned life insurance\n5,160\n5,125\nOther assets\n646\n981\nTotal assets\n$ 310,463\n$ 321,247\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nLiabilities:\nDeposits\n$ 261,769\n$ 270,307\nAdvances from Federal Home Loan Bank\n15,099\n16,648\nAccrued expenses and other liabilities\n1,400\n1,350\nTotal liabilities\n278,268\n288,305\nStockholders' equity:\nCommon stock ($0.01 par value 20,000,000 shares authorized\n4,034,675 shares issued)\n40\n40\nAdditional paid-in capital\n28,264\n28,264\nRetained earnings\n8,822\n8,612\nTreasury stock at cost (307,750 shares)\n(2,964)\n(2,964)\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss\n(1,967)\n(1,010)\nTotal stockholders' equity\n32,195\n32,942\nTotal liabilities and stockholders' equity\n$ 310,463\n$ 321,247\nFirst Federal of Northern Michigan Bancorp, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income\n(in thousands)\nFor the Three Months\nEnded March 31,\n2018\n2017\n(Unaudited)\nInterest income:\nInterest and fees on loans\n$ 2,225\n$ 2,126\nInterest and dividends on investments\nTaxable\n350\n393\nTax-exempt\n18\n23\nInterest on mortgage-backed securities\n205\n255\nTotal interest income\n2,798\n2,797\nInterest expense:\nInterest on deposits\n224\n245\nInterest on borrowings\n61\n62\nTotal interest expense\n285\n307\nNet interest income\n2,513\n2,490\nProvision for loan losses\n(84)\n87\nNet interest income after provision for loan losses\n2,597\n2,403\nNon-interest income:\nService charges and other fees\n209\n220\nMortgage banking activities\n91\n100\nNet gain (loss) on sale of premises and equipment, real estate owned and other repossessed assets\n4\n8\nNet gain (loss) on sale of investment securities\n-\n18\nOther\n280\n46\nTotal non-interest income\n584\n392\nNon-interest expense:\nCompensation and employee benefits\n1,599\n1,396\nFDIC Insurance Premiums\n31\n38\nAdvertising\n32\n38\nOccupancy\n277\n296\nAmortization of intangible assets\n42\n48\nService bureau charges\n137\n129\nProfessional services\n291\n106\nCollection activity\n4\n27\nReal estate owned & other repossessed assets\n6\n36\nOther\n262\n291\nTotal non-interest expense\n2,681\n2,405\nIncome before income tax expense\n500\n390\nIncome tax expense\n104\n-\nNet Income\n$ 396\n$ 390\nOther Comprehensive Income:\nUnrealized gain on investment securities -
