    "text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Magenta Therapeutics , a biotechnology company developing novel medicines to bring the curative power of bone marrow transplant to more patients, today announced that chief operating officer Bastiano Sanna, Ph.D., has resigned from the Company, effective March 30, to pursue an opportunity outside of Magenta. Dr. Sanna has agreed to assist Magenta in an advisory capacity through the second quarter of 2018.\n“All of us at Magenta thank Bastiano for his many important contributions and leadership across the organization, and we all wish him the best as he moves to the next stage in his career,” said Jason Gardner, D.Phil., chief executive officer, president and co-founder, Magenta Therapeutics.\n“I am proud of the tremendous progress Magenta has made since its launch in late 2016. It has been an honor to help build the leading transplant medicine company,” said Dr. Sanna. “I’ve enjoyed having the opportunity to work with this extraordinary team of world-class scientists, and I look forward to following Magenta’s continued success as it works to transform the lives of patients.”\nAbout Bone Marrow Transplant\nHealthy bone marrow stem cells and the blood cells they create are crucial for survival, but certain diseases can affect the bone marrow, interfering with its ability to function properly. A bone marrow transplant is a process to replace unhealthy bone marrow with healthy bone marrow stem cells. Bone marrow transplant can save the lives of patients with blood cancers and genetic diseases and is a potential cure for patients with severe refractory autoimmune diseases. Currently bone marrow transplant is still associated with risk, toxic side effects, and complexity for patients that could benefit from the procedure. Magenta is working to address these challenges through its integrated portfolio of therapeutics.\nAbout Magenta Therapeutics\nMagenta Therapeutics is a biotechnology company developing therapeutics to revolutionize bone marrow transplant for patients with autoimmune diseases, blood cancers and genetic diseases. By creating a platform focused on critical areas of unmet need, Magenta Therapeutics is pioneering an integrated approach to extend the curative power of bone marrow transplant to more patients, by making the process more effective, safer, and easier. Founded by internationally recognized leaders in bone marrow transplant medicine, Magenta Therapeutics was launched in 2016 by Third Rock Ventures and Atlas Venture and is headquartered in Cambridge, Mass.
