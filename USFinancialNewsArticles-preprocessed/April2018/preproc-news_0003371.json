    "text": "- Strong sequential growth in fourth quarter caps 2017 reorganization -\n- World class team and new business model set stage for significant growth in 2018 -\nSANTA MONICA, Calif., April 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Starco Brands (OTC:STCB) reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017 as the Company resets for its first full year under the new business model in 2018.\n2017 Highlights:\nStrategic pivot to creating and marketing behavior-changing brands manufactured by our licensing partner The Starco Group (TSG); Initial royalty revenue from the launch of Breathe™ household cleaning aerosol line, our first major proprietary brand, which launched in all Wegmans stores and garnered three prestigious consumer product awards; Appointment of Ross Sklar of The Starco Group as CEO of Starco Brands; Distribution and sales agreement with United Natural Foods, Inc.; Change of the company’s name to Starco Brands, and its stock trading symbol to STCB; and Assembly of world-class Brand Advisory Board consisting of proven brand-builders.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Results\nNet revenues for the fourth quarter were $5,158, up 70% sequentially over the $3,027 reported in the third quarter of 2017, bringing total net revenues in 2017 to $8,185. (Comparisons to 2016 results are not relevant, as the Company was inactive and restructuring prior to mid-2017. Revenues under the new business model did not begin until the second half of 2017.) Net revenues in 2017 consisted of royalties from TSG’s sales of Breathe products, and represented the first operating revenues under the new business model.\nOperating expenses totaled $251,713 for the fourth quarter, and $690,667 for the full year. The net loss for the fourth quarter was $225,092, or $0.08 per diluted share. For the full year, the net loss was $728,403, or $0.47 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $246,555 for the fourth quarter, and negative $677,014 for the full year. See note below on “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information.”\nManagement Commentary\n“We entered 2017 with an ambitious agenda to completely overhaul and reinvent the company under an entirely new business model utilizing new products. I am pleased to report we accomplished the restructuring and ended the year with impressive momentum,” said Starco Brands’ CEO Ross Sklar. “We assembled a world class group of proven brand-builders and marketers, launched Breathe, the first of many breakthrough products we are developing, and set the stage for a year of exciting growth in 2018.”\nMr. Sklar continued, “In recent months, several more retailers have begun carrying Breathe, and we are making progress on other new ground-breaking products to be launched with major retailers in 2018. Our partnership with the $8 billion distribution company UNFI sets us up for broader distribution into channels that are in line with our health conscious products. We believe our platform, with a low-overhead and high-margin royalty model, will allow us to create significant shareholder value in the coming years.”\nMr. Sklar added, “Breathe is the only household cleaning aerosol line that is approved by the EPA’s Safer Choice Program globally and is currently on shelves at all Wegmans Food Markets, a 93-store grocery chain known for its innovation.”\nSubsequent Events\nReverse stock split – On February 20 th , 2018, a previously announced thirty-for-one reverse stock split took effect, reducing the number of shares from 72.5 million shares to 2.4 million.\nStock issuance – On February 26 th , 117.3 million shares were issued to officers and directors for services rendered, and 30.3 million shares were issued to various service providers, bringing the total number of shares as of March 18 th , 2018 to 150.0 million.\nMarketing team assembled - On February 23 rd , the Company introduced its Brand Advisory Board (BAB), whose members include David Dreyer (Marketing), Xanthe Wells (Creative), Lisa Becker (Public Relations) and Kendra Bracken-Ferguson (Digital and Social Media). Each member of the BAB has over 15 years of experience in their field; the brands they have helped build, grow and promote are some of the most iconic in the world, including Apple, PlayStation, Ford, Pepsi, Nest, Infiniti, Burger King, Dr. Pepper, GRAMMYs, Sara Lee, Pizza Hut and others.\nOutlook\nThe Company expects revenues to grow significantly in 2018, driven by expanded distribution of Breathe products, new product and brand launches and by the addition of product licenses to be acquired during the coming year. Operating expenses are expected to grow as the Company expands its marketing team and activities.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nIn addition to the preliminary results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP included in this release, the Company has provided certain non-GAAP financial information including adjusted EBITDA which is a non-GAAP metric that excludes various items that are detailed in the financial tables and accompanying footnotes reconciling GAAP to non-GAAP results contained in this release.

This information should be considered in addition to the results presented in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for the GAAP results.
