    "text": "NEW YORK, April 25 (Reuters) - The New York Stocks Exchange said in an alert to traders on Wednesday that trading was suspended for the rest of the day in five symbols, including Amazon and Alphabet.\nThe exchange said the suspension was due to a “price scale code” issue and any open orders in those securities will be canceled.\nAside from Amazon.com and both Alphabet share classes, affected symbols included Booking Holdings as well as Zion Oil and Gas Equity Warrants .
