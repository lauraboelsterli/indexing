    "text": "BEIJING, April 26 (Reuters) - London aluminium slipped 1.3 percent lower on Thursday, after snapping a four-day losing streak in the previous session, as the deadline extension to comply with U.S. sanctions on Rusal, one of the world's biggest aluminium producers, pulled down prices. The metal is down by over 18 percent from the seven-year high of $2,718 it hit on April 19 in the wake of the sanctions, which left the market fearing a supply shortage. FUNDAMENTALS * LME ALUMINIUM: Three-month aluminium on the London Metal Exchange was down 1.3 percent at $2,217 a tonne, as of 0219 GMT, after ending 0.8 percent higher on Wednesday. * SHFE ALUMINIUM: The most-traded June aluminium contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange edged down 0.4 percent to 14,380 yuan ($2,273.30) a tonne. * RUSAL: The London Metal Exchange said on Wednesday it would analyse the implications of U.S. sanctions in relation to Rusal's metal after the Treasury Department gave customers of the aluminium producer more time to comply. * ZINC: Shanghai zinc was the biggest loser in the base metals complex, falling 2.8 percent to 23,735 yuan a tonne and touching its lowest since April 18. It tracked a 2.4 percent plunge in LME zinc on Wednesday after inventories in LME warehouses MZN-STOCKS surged by 28,150 tonnes or 15.5 percent. * ANGLO AMERICAN: Diversified miner Anglo American opened an office in Shanghai on Wednesday, a company spokesman said, boosting its presence in the world's top consumer of commodities. * NICKEL: Global demand for nickel is expected to increase to 2.34 million tonnes in 2018 versus 2.19 million in 2017, the International Nickel Study Group (INSG) said on Wednesday. * VALE: Vale SA, the world's largest iron ore producer, posted a 36 percent slump in first-quarter profit compared to the same quarter a year earlier, missing estimates, as costs rose and iron ore prices slipped, results showed on Wednesday. * For the top stories in metals and other news, click or MARKETS NEWS * Asian stocks edged up on Thursday as robust corporate earnings helped Wall Street quell concerns over a surge in U.S. bond yields, while the dollar hovered near three-month highs against a basket of currencies.
