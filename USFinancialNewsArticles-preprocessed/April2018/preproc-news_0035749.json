    "text": "Q1 2018 Highlights\nNet income of $10.6 million, or $0.74 per diluted share Annualized loan and lease growth of 12.2% Definitive agreement to enter the Springfield, Missouri market by merging with Springfield Bancshares, Inc.\nMOLINE, Ill., April 18, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- QCR Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCRH), today announced net income of $10.6 million and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) of $0.74 for the first quarter of 2018, compared to net income of $9.9 million and diluted EPS of $0.70 for the fourth quarter of 2017. The fourth quarter results included a number of non-core items. Excluding these non-core items, the Company reported core net income (non-GAAP) of $9.9 million and core diluted EPS of $0.70 for the fourth quarter of 2017. Core net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $10.6 million and core diluted EPS was $0.75. For the first quarter of 2017, the Company reported net income of $9.2 million and diluted EPS of $0.68.\n“We are very pleased with our strong start to 2018,” commented Douglas M. Hultquist, President and Chief Executive Officer, “We delivered solid organic loan growth, meaningful fee income, excellent credit quality and improved profitability through the execution of our ongoing key initiatives. We are also pleased to announce that we have reached a definitive agreement to enter the Springfield, Missouri market by merging with Springfield Bancshares, Inc., the holding company of Springfield First Community Bank, based in Springfield, Missouri. This will add a fifth charter to our Company and provide us entry into the attractive Springfield market, where we plan to continue to build upon their strong reputation and market position.”\nAnnualized Loan and Lease Growth of 12.2%\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company’s total assets increased $43.6 million, to a total of $4.0 billion, while total loans and leases grew $90.4 million, or 3.1% on a linked quarter basis. Loan and lease growth was primarily funded by a combination of the excess liquidity the Company had at year-end, a modest increase in deposits, and an increase in short-term borrowings.\n“Annualized organic loan and lease growth was a healthy 12.2% during the first quarter, and at the high end of our long-term targeted growth rate of 10% – 12%,” commented Mr. Hultquist. “Our loan growth was driven by healthy demand for both commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans and was broad based across all of our charters. We continue to grow loans organically through market share increases, attracting new clients that appreciate our relationship-based community banking model.”\nAnnualized Net Interest Income Growth of 7.5%\nNet interest income for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $32.4 million compared with $31.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, and $27.7 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in net interest income was due primarily to an increase in average loan balances and the impact of higher loan yields, driven principally by the Federal Reserve's December rate hike, partially offset by higher funding costs. Acquisition-related net accretion totaled $0.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, consistent with the fourth quarter of 2017 and compared to $1.9 million for the first quarter of 2017. Excluding acquisition-related net accretion, net interest income of $31.7 million for the first quarter of 2018 increased 2.1%, compared to $31.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNet interest margin, excluding acquisition accounting net accretion, was down five basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017. However, the lower tax rate in the first quarter of 2018 due to the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act decreased the tax equivalent yield (“TEY”) on the Company’s nontaxable securities and loans, which negatively impacted net interest margin comparisons on a linked quarter basis. Excluding the TEY adjustments and acquisition accounting net accretion from each quarter, net interest margin actually increased eight basis points.\nAnnualized Wealth Management Revenue Growth of 10.8%\nSwap Fee Income and Gains on the Sale of Government Guaranteed Loans of $1.3 million\nNoninterest income for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $8.5 million, as compared to $9.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily due to $1.5 million lower swap fee income, as the fourth quarter generated an outsized $2.5 million of swap fee income relative to a more normalized quarter. Wealth management revenue was $3.2 million for the quarter, an increase of 2.7% from the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNoninterest income increased 17.3% from $7.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to higher wealth management revenue, deposit service fees, and swap fee income.\n“Swap fee income and gains on the sale of government guaranteed loans totaled $1.3 million for the first quarter, moderately higher than our annualized expectation of $4.0 million. Given the nature of this fee income source, large fluctuations can occur from quarter-to-quarter, as we experienced in 2017,” stated Todd A. Gipple, Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. “We are pleased with the annualized growth of our wealth management revenue. These services are highly valued by our clients and we continue to expect them to be a growing part of our noninterest income revenue stream going forward.”\nNoninterest Expenses Well Controlled and Total $25.9 million for the First Quarter\nNoninterest expenses for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $25.9 million, compared with $31.4 million and $21.3 million for the fourth and first quarters of 2017, respectively. The linked quarter decrease in noninterest expenses was primarily attributable to a $4.4 million reduction in acquisition costs and post-acquisition compensation, transition and integration costs which were incurred in the fourth quarter of 2017 and were related to the acquisition of Guaranty Bank & Trust Company (“Guaranty Bank”). In addition, the Company realized the full amount of anticipated cost savings from the Guaranty Bank acquisition during the first quarter of 2018.\nThe Company’s operating efficiency ratio was 63.2% in the first quarter of 2018, compared with 75.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 60.9% in the first quarter of 2017.\nAsset Quality Remains Solid\nNonperforming assets (“NPAs”) totaled $31.0 million, a decrease of $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2018. The ratio of NPAs to total assets was 0.77% at March 31, 2018, which was down from 0.81% at December 31, 2017 and down from 0.81% a year ago.\nThe Company’s provision for loan and lease losses totaled $2.5 million for the first quarter of 2018, which was up $285,000 from the prior quarter, and up $435,000 compared to the first quarter of 2017. The linked quarter growth in the provision for loan and lease losses was due to the growth in the loan and lease portfolio. As of March 31, 2018, the Company’s allowance to total loans and leases was 1.20%, which was up from 1.16% at December 31, 2017 and down from 1.32% at March 31, 2017.\nIn accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for acquisition accounting, the loans acquired through the acquisition of Community State Bank and Guaranty Bank were recorded at market value; therefore, there was no allowance associated with the acquired loans. Management continues to evaluate the allowance needed on the acquired loans factoring in the net remaining discount ($7.3 million at March 31, 2018). When factoring this remaining discount into the Company’s allowance to total loans and leases calculation, the Company’s allowance as a percentage of total loans and leases increases from 1.20% to 1.43%.\nCapital Levels Remain Strong\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company’s total risk-based capital ratio was 11.37%, the common equity tier 1 ratio was 9.23%, and the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.10%. By comparison, these respective ratios were 11.15%, 9.10% and 8.01% as of December 31, 2017.\nContinued Focus on Seven Key Initiatives\nThe Company continues to focus on the following long-term initiatives in an effort to improve profitability and drive increased shareholder value:\nStrong organic loan and lease growth in order to maintain loans and leases to total assets ratio in the range of 73% - 78% Grow core deposits to maintain reliance on wholesale funding at less than 15% of assets Generate gains on sale of USDA and SBA loans, and fee income on interest rate swaps, as a significant and consistent component of core revenue Grow wealth management net income by 10% annually Carefully manage noninterest expense growth Maintain asset quality metrics at better than peer levels Participate as an acquirer in the consolidation taking place in our industry to further boost ROAA, improve efficiency ratio, and increase EPS\nConference Call Details\nThe Company will host an earnings call/webcast today, April 18, 2018 at 10:30 a.m. central time.

The Company's management believes that this measurement is important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in changes period-to-period in common equity. In compliance with applicable rules of the SEC, this non-GAAP measure is reconciled to stockholders' equity and total assets, which are the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n(2) Core net income, core net income attributable to QCR Holdings, Inc. common stockholders, core earnings per common share and core return on average assets are non-GAAP financial measures. The Company's management believes that these measurements are important to investors as they exclude non-recurring income and expense items, therefore, they provide a more realistic run-rate for future periods. In compliance with applicable rules of the SEC, this non-GAAP measure is reconciled to net income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\n(3) Nonrecurring items (post-tax) are calculated using an estimated effective tax rate of 35% for periods prior to March 31, 2018 and 21% for periods including and after March 31, 2018.\n(4) Acquisition costs were analyzed individually for deductibility. Presented amounts are tax-effected accordingly.\n(5) Interest earned and yields on nontaxable securities and loans are determined on a tax equivalent basis using a 35% tax rate for each period prior to March 31, 2018 and 21% for periods including and after March 31, 2018.\n(6) Net interest margin (TEY) is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company's management utilizes this measurement to take into account the tax benefit associated with certain loans and securities. It is also standard industry practice to measure net interest margin using tax-equivalent measures. In compliance with applicable rules of the SEC, this non-GAAP measure is reconciled to net interest income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\n(7) Efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure. The Company's management utilizes this ratio to compare to industry peers. The ratio is used to calculate overhead as a percentage of revenue. In compliance with the applicable rules of the SEC, this non-GAAP measure is reconciled to noninterest expense, net interest income and noninterest income, which are the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nSource:QCR Holdings, Inc.",
