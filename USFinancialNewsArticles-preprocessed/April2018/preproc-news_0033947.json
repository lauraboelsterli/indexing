    "text": "SHANGHAI, April 18 (Reuters) -\n* The global lithium industry will need $10 billion-$12 billion investment over the next decade to meet growing demand for the metal on the back of the electric vehicle boom, Chilean lithium miner SQM says\n* Demand is set to grow by 600,000-800,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent over the next 10 years, Daniel Jimenez, senior commercial vice president at SQM, tells the Metal Bulletin Battery Materials Conference in Shanghai\n* Lithium is a key ingredient in batteries for electric vehicles\n* SQMâ€™s projection is based on typical greenfield capital expenditure per tonne of lithium carbonate equivalent, he adds, noting that the industry has historically underestimated lithium demand and over-estimated supply\n* Company currently has annual lithium carbonate production capacity of 48,000 tonnes in Chile, which it will expand to 70,000 tonnes this year and to 100,000 tonnes next year, Jimenez says.
