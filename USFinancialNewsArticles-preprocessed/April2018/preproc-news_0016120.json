    "text": "JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo has instructed his cabinet to open up the university sector to 100 percent foreign investment, Thomas Lembong, the head of the country’s investment board, told an economic conference on Wednesday.\nIndonesian President Joko Widodo delivers a speech at Foreign Ministry office in Jakarta, Indonesia, February 12, 2018. Antara Foto/Wahyu Putro/ via REUTERS “We’re going to go from zero percent to 100 percent foreign ownership allowed overnight,” he said, adding that international vocational institutions would also be allowed to open campus in Southeast Asia’s largest economy.\nHe gave no timeframe for when the policy will take effect, however.\nThe government has previously said it will ease ownership rules in several sectors that are partly, or entirely, closed to foreigners, in a bid to attract investment.\nReporting by Tabita Diela; Writing by Gayatri Suroyo\n ",
