Soccer Football - Championship - Preston North End vs Derby County - Deepdale, Preston, Britain - April 2, 2018 Derby County's Scott Carson in action Action Images/Craig Brough \nGiven Derby’s recent record of late season collapses, the 4-1 loss to lowly Sunderland on Friday could easily have shattered the confidence of Gary Rowett’s side but they responded strongly. \nThey were given a let-off, however, when Alan Browne missed a first-half penalty for 10th-placed Preston and went on to grab the win through Tom Lawrence’s 52nd minute free kick. \nThe victory ended an eight-match winless run for fifth-placed Derby.

It didn’t matter how we won the game, we need to play better than that but, to be honest, I’m not bothered today,” Rowett said. \n“I don’t think it was about the points today or where we are in the league, but more about the psychological angle because the longer the winless run went on, the more pressure there would be on the players,” he added.
