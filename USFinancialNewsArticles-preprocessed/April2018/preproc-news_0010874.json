A photo illustration shows the Uber app on a mobile telephone, as it is held up for a posed photograph, in London, Britain November 10, 2017. REUTERS/Simon Dawson/File Photo \nThe taxi app is battling to keep its cars on the streets of the British capital city after London’s transport regulator deemed it unfit to run a taxi service, in a decision the Silicon Valley firm is appealing. \nSince then it has made a series of changes to its business model, responding to requests from regulators, including the introduction of 24/7 telephone support and the proactive reporting of serious incidents to London’s police. \nIt also appointed Laurel Powers-Freeling, who has held a series of banking roles, as its first British chair last year. \nOn Friday it said Susan Hooper, who is currently a non-executive director at Wizz Air ( WIZZ.L ) and the Brexit ministry, and Roger Parry, whose current roles include being non-executive chairman at YouGov, had been appointed to its British boards.
