    "text": "PANAMA CITY (Reuters) - Panama consumer prices rose 0.6 percent in March from the same month last year, driven by increases in prices for education, restaurants and hotels, the Central American nationâ€™s comptroller said on Friday.\nBetween January and March, Panama registered inflation of 0.4 percent, according to the Index of Consumer Prices (IPC) report.\nIn March, the prices that rose most were for education (3.7 percent), restaurants and hotels (2.9 percent), transportation (1.8 percent) and health (1.7 percent).\nBy contrast, prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages fell 1.5 percent in March from the same month last year.\nSince 2014, Panama has maintained a price control program for the most-consumed products in the country, which authorities credit with helping keep inflation below 1 percent.\nThe country ended 2017 with inflation of 0.9 percent.\nReporting by Elida Moreno; writing by Julia Love; Editing by David Gregorio\n ",
