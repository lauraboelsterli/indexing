    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump could possibly come to Britain for a working visit in July, Sky News reported on Wednesday, saying details of the trip were expected to be announced in the next few days.\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump toasts French President Emmanuel Macron (not pictured) during a State Dinner at the White House in Washington, U.S. April 24, 2018. REUTERS/Carlos Barria A working visit would be more low-key than a full state visit. Prime Minister Theresa May invited Trump for a state visit when she went to Washington in January 2017, prompting protests, and a date for the visit has never been set.\nA spokesman for May declined to comment on the Sky story, but said discussions are ongoing about Trumpâ€™s visit and that it is expected later this year.\nReporting by Sarah Young and Andrew MacAskill; writing by Alistair Smout; editing by Stephen Addison\n ",
