    "text": "CALGARY, Alberta, April 18, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Appulse Corporation (“Appulse” or “the Corporation”) today reported revenues of $8,440,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $8,080,000 for the previous year. Net income for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017 was $49,000 ($.00 per share) compared to $126,000 ($.01 per share) for the prior year. A 2017 positive cash flow from operations of $357,000 compares to $420,000 for the 2016 fiscal period. Cash flow from operations is defined as net income or loss adjusted for items not affecting cash.\nRevenue from the sale of centrifuge parts increased by 10% in 2017 when compared to the previous year while service revenues increased by 7%. The increase in parts and service revenues were partially offset by the unusually low level of machine sales in the year, reflecting a reluctance by customers to undertake capital expenditures under volatile economic conditions. Net income was also impacted by a reversal of the prior year’s exchange gains reflecting a weak Canadian dollar, and a non-cash stock-based compensation charge of $42,000 (2016- nil). General and administrative costs increased by 4.5% during the year primarily reflecting a continued emphasis on the expansion of the Corporation’s customer base.\nWith respect to 2018, management noted that the Corporation now has approximately $1,100,000 in firm machine orders for delivery during the first half of 2018, compared to machine sales of only $1,333,000 for the entire year of 2017.\nAbout Appulse\nThrough its subsidiaries, Centrifuges Unlimited Inc., Rolyn Oilfield Services Inc., and Design Machining Unlimited Inc., Appulse specializes in the sales, servicing and refurbishing of centrifuge equipment, serving both domestic and international markets, and offers full service industrial machining. The Corporation continues to expand its product base and geographic markets, in addition to pursuing further representative arrangements and joint venture opportunities.\nFurther information on Appulse and its subsidiaries can be obtained through the Corporation’s website, at www.appulsecorp.net and on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .
