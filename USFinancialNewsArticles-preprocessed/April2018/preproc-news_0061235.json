Soccer Football - Premier League - West Ham United v Manchester City - London Stadium, London, Britain - April 29, 2018 Manchester City's Raheem Sterling is challenged in the area by West Ham United's Aaron Cresswell however a penalty is not awarded Action Images via Reuters/John Sibley\nCity’s tally of 102 goals for the season is one off Chelsea’s Premier League record set in 2009-10. They have 93 points, two short of the Premier League best which was also set by Chelsea in 2004-2005.\n“We wanted to win today so that we can get the record of 96 points at home when we get the trophy in front of our people next week,” City manager Pep Guardiola said.\nAdrian started in goal for West Ham, with loanee Joe Hart unable to face his parent club, but the Spaniard could do nothing as Sane — back in the team at the expense of David Silva — saw his powerful strike go in off Evra’s head.

You need things to go for you and a bit of good fortune when you play a team like Manchester City.”\nWest Ham did improve and got themselves back in the match after Cresswell curled a free kick into the bottom corner.\nThe West Ham fans’ joy was short-lived, however, as City upped the ante after the break.\nGabriel Jesus converted from close range in the 53rd minute after a flowing move before Fernandinho stroked home to make it four nine minutes later.\nThe rest of the match was a procession for City as they strolled to a 30th win of the season, equalling the record for victories in a Premier League campaign.
