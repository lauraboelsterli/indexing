    "text": "CHICO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TriCo Bancshares (NASDAQ: TCBK) (the \"Company\"), parent company of Tri Counties Bank, today announced net income of $13,910,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $12,079,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Diluted earnings per share were $0.60 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $0.52 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Net income before taxes was $19,350,000 and $19,431,000 for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 includes the effect of a change in the Company’s Federal tax rate from 35% to 21% that resulted from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that was effective on January 1, 2018. During the quarter ended March 31, 2018, income tax expense was $2,020,000 lower than it would have been, and net income was $2,020,000 higher than it would have been, had the tax rate not changed. Also, affecting net income during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $476,000 of merger and acquisition expenses related to the proposed merger with FNB Bancorp (“FNBB”) previously announced on December 11, 2017 compared to no merger and acquisition expense recorded in the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nPerformance highlights and other developments for the Company during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 included the following:\nTotal loan balances averaged $3,028,178,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2018 representing a $269,634,000 (9.8%) increase compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The average rate of interest paid on deposits, including the effect of noninterest-bearing deposits, remained low at 0.11%.\nThe following is a summary of the components of the Company’s consolidated net income, average common shares, and average diluted common shares outstanding for the periods indicated:\nThree months ended March 31, (dollars and shares in thousands) 2018 2017 $ Change\n% Change Net Interest Income $44,986 $41,993 $2,993 7.1 % Reversal of provision for loan losses 236 1,557 (1,321 ) Noninterest income 12,290 11,703 587 5.0 % Noninterest expense (38,162 ) (35,822 ) (2,340 ) 6.5 % Provision for income taxes (5,440 ) (7,352 ) 1,912 (26.0 %) Net income $13,910 $12,079 $1,831 15.2 % Average common shares 22,956 22,870 86 0.4 % Average diluted common shares 23,283 23,232 51 0.2 % The following is a summary of certain of the Company’s consolidated assets and deposits as of the dates indicated:\nEnding balances As of March 31, ($'s in thousands) 2018 2017 $ Change\n% Change Total assets $4,779,957 $4,527,954 $252,003 5.6% Total loans 3,069,733 2,761,192 308,541 11.2% Total investments 1,251,776 1,168,812 82,964 7.1% Total deposits $4,084,404 $3,898,884 $185,520 4.8% Qtrly avg balances As of March 31, ($'s in thousands) 2018 2017 $ Change\n% Change Total assets $4,741,227 $4,493,657 $247,570 5.5% Total loans 3,028,178 2,758,544 269,634 9.8% Total investments 1,261,554 1,174,519 87,035 7.4% Total deposits $4,004,332 $3,862,793 $141,539 3.7% The Company’s primary source of revenue is net interest income, or the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Included in the Company’s net interest income is interest income from municipal bonds that is almost entirely exempt from Federal income tax. These municipal bonds are classified as investments – nontaxable, and the Company may present the interest income from these bonds on a fully tax equivalent (FTE) basis.\nLoans acquired through purchase, or acquisition of other banks, are classified by the Company as Purchased Not Credit Impaired (PNCI), Purchased Credit Impaired – cash basis (PCI – cash basis), or Purchased Credit Impaired – other (PCI – other). Loans not acquired in an acquisition or otherwise “purchased” are classified as “originated”. Often, such purchased loans are purchased at a discount to face value, and part of this discount is accreted into (added to) interest income over the remaining life of the loan. A loan may also be purchased at a premium to face value, in which case, the premium is amortized into (subtracted from) interest income over the remaining life of the loan. Generally, as time goes on, the effects of loan discount accretion and loan premium amortization decrease as the purchased loans mature or pay off early. Upon the early pay off of a loan, any remaining (unaccreted) discount or (unamortized) premium is immediately taken into interest income; and as loan payoffs may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, so may the impact of discount accretion and premium amortization on interest income. Further details regarding interest income from loans, including fair value discount accretion, may be found under the heading “Supplemental Loan Interest Income Data” in the Consolidated Financial Data table at the end of this announcement.\nFollowing is a summary of the components of net interest income for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\nThree months ended March 31, (dollars and shares in thousands) 2018 2017 $ Change\n% Change Interest income $47,121 $43,484 $3,637 8.4 % Interest expense (2,135 ) (1,491 ) (644 ) 43.2 % FTE adjustment 312 625 (313 ) (50.1 %) Net interest income (FTE) $45,298 $42,618 $2,680 6.3 % Net interest margin (FTE) 4.14 % 4.13 % Purchased loan discount accretion: Amount (included in interest income) $632 $1,541 Effect on average loan yield 0.08 % 0.22 % Effect on net interest margin (FTE) 0.06 % 0.15 % Interest income recovered via loan sales: Amount (included in interest income) - - Effect on average loan yield 0.00 % 0.00 % Effect on net interest margin (FTE) 0.00 % 0.00 % The following table shows the components of net interest income and net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent (FTE) basis for the periods indicated:\nANALYSIS OF CHANGE IN NET INTEREST MARGIN ON EARNING ASSETS (unaudited, dollars in thousands) Three Months Ended\nThree Months Ended\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nMarch 31, 2017\nAverage Income/ Yield/ Average Income/ Yield/ Average Income/ Yield/ Balance Expense Rate Balance Expense Rate Balance Expense Rate Assets Earning assets Loans $3,028,178 $38,049 5.03 % $2,948,277 $38,194 5.18 % $2,758,544 $34,914 5.06 % Investments - taxable 1,125,394 7,658 2.72 % 1,118,547 7,459 2.67 % 1,038,229 7,094 2.73 % Investments - nontaxable 136,160 1,353 3.97 % 136,321 1,666 4.89 % 136,290 1,666 4.89 % Cash at Federal Reserve and other banks 90,864 373 1.64 % 86,511 267 1.23 % 197,406 435 0.88 % Total earning assets 4,380,596 47,433 4.33 % 4,289,656 47,586 4.44 % 4,130,469 44,109 4.27 % Other assets, net 360,631 369,021 363,188 Total assets $4,741,227 $4,658,677 $4,493,657 Liabilities and shareholders' equity Interest-bearing Demand deposits $994,206 211 0.08 % $964,827 210 0.09 % $907,104 127 0.06 % Savings deposits 1,371,377 411 0.12 % 1,380,384 430 0.12 % 1,376,048 424 0.12 % Time deposits 306,514 474 0.62 % 307,446 422 0.55 % 331,789 343 0.41 % Other borrowings 107,781 342 1.27 % 61,769 141 0.91 % 17,483 2 0.05 % Junior subordinated debt 56,882 697 4.90 % 56,837 665 4.68 % 56,690 595 4.20 % Total interest-bearing liabilities 2,836,760 2,135 0.30 % 2,771,263 1,868 0.27 % 2,689,114 1,491 0.22 % Noninterest-bearing deposits 1,332,235 1,308,765 1,247,852 Other liabilities 66,219 65,642 71,880 Shareholders' equity 506,013 513,007 484,811 Total liabilities and shareholders' equity $4,741,227 $4,658,677 $4,493,657 Net interest rate spread 4.03 % 4.17 % 4.05 % Net interest income/net interest margin (FTE) 45,298 4.14 % 45,718 4.26 % 42,618 4.13 % FTE adjustment (312 ) (625 ) (625 ) Net interest income (not FTE) $44,986 $45,093 $41,993 Purchase loan discount accretion effect: Amount (included in interest income) $632 $1,489 $1,541 Effect on avg loan yield 0.08 % 0.20 % 0.22 % Effect on net interest margin 0.06 % 0.14 % 0.15 % Loan sale effect: Amount (included in interest income) - - - Effect on avg loan yield 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % Effect on net interest margin 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % Net interest income (FTE) during the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased $2,680,000 (6.3%) to $45,298,000 compared to $42,618,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in net interest income (FTE) was due primarily to increases in the average balance of loans and investments that were partially offset by an increase in other borrowings, a 3 basis point decrease in yield on loans, and an 8 basis point increase in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. The 3 basis point decrease in loan yields from 5.06% during the three months ended March 31, 2017 to 5.03% during the three months ended March 31, 2018 was due to a decrease in purchased loan discount accretion from $1,541,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2017 to $632,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2018. This decrease in purchased loan discount accretion reduced loan yields by 14 basis points, and net interest margin by 9 basis points, but was substantially offset by increases in new and renewed loan yields due to increases in market yields. The 8 basis point increase in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to increases in market rates that increased the rates the Company pays on its overnight borrowings and junior subordinated debt.\nAlso affecting net interest margin during the three months ended March 31, 2018, was the decrease in the Federal tax rate from 35% to 21%. This decrease in the Federal tax rate caused the fully tax-equivalent (FTE) yield on the Company’s nontaxable investments to decrease from 4.89% during the three months ended March 31, 2017 to 3.97% during the three months ended March 31, 2018, and resulted in net interest income (FTE) being $312,000, or 2 basis points, less than it otherwise would have been.\nThe negative impact on net interest margin from these decreases in average loan and nontaxable investments yields was offset by the positive impact of an increase in average loan balances and a decrease in the average balance of lower yielding interest earning cash compared to the year-ago quarter.\nThe table below that sets forth a summary of the changes in interest income and interest expense from changes in average asset and liability balances (volume) and changes in average interest yields and rates for each category of interest earning asset and interest paying liability for the periods indicated:\nThree months ended March 31, 2018\ncompared with three months ended March 31, 2017\nVolume Yield/Rate Total Increase (decrease) in interest income: Loans $3,411 $(276 ) $3,135 Investments - taxable 595 (31 ) 564 Investments - nontaxable (2 ) (311 ) (313 ) Federal funds sold (234 ) 172 (62 ) Total 3,770 (446 ) 3,324 Increase (decrease) in interest expense: Demand deposits (interest-bearing) 13 71 84 Savings deposits (1 ) (12 ) (13 ) Time deposits (26 ) 157 131 Other borrowings 11 329 340 Junior subordinated debt 2 100 102 Total (1 ) 645 644 Increase (decrease) in net interest income $3,771 $(1,091 ) $2,680 The Company recorded a reversal of provision for loan losses of $236,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to a reversal of provision for loan losses of $1,557,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2017. The $236,000 reversal of provision for loan losses during the three months ended March 31, 2018 was due primarily to a decrease in the balance of performing/unimpaired but substandard loans during the three months ended March 31, 2018. Nonperforming loans were $24,381,000, or 0.79% of loans outstanding as of March 31, 2018, compared to $24,394,000, or 0.81% of loans outstanding as of December 31, 2017, and $19,511,000, or 0.71% of loans outstanding as of March 31, 2017. Net loan charge-offs during the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $114,000.\nThe following table presents the key components of noninterest income for the periods indicated:\nThree months ended March 31, (dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 $ Change\n% Change Service charges on deposit accounts $3,779 $3,619 $160 4.4 % ATM fees and interchange 4,235 4,015 220 5.5 % Other service fees 714 765 (51 ) (6.7 %) Mortgage banking service fees 517 521 (4 ) (0.8 %) Change in value of mortgage servicing rights 111 (13 ) 124 (953.8 %) Total service charges and fees 9,356 8,907 449 5.0 % Gain on sale of loans 626 910 (284 ) (31.2 %) Commission on nondeposit investment products 876 607 269 44.3 % Increase in cash value of life insurance 608 685 (77 ) (11.2 %) Change in indemnification asset - (221 ) 221 (100.0 %) Gain on sale of foreclosed assets 371 118 253 214.4 % Other noninterest income 453 697 (244 ) (35.0 %) Total other noninterest income 2,934 2,796 138 4.9 % Total noninterest income $12,290 $11,703 $587 5.0 % Noninterest income increased $587,000 (5.0%) to $12,290,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in noninterest income was due to the changes noted in the table above. The $269,000 increase in commissions on nondeposit investment products was due to continued focus in this area. The $253,000 increase in gain on sale of foreclosed assets was due to the sale of six foreclosed properties each of which had increases in property values since they were foreclosed. The $221,000 increase in change in indemnification asset was due to a $221,000 decrease in the indemnification asset during the first quarter of 2017, and no change during the first quarter of 2018 as the Company and the FDIC terminated their loss sharing agreements during the second quarter of 2017. The $220,000 increase in ATM fees and interchange revenue was due primarily to increased interchange revenue. The $160,000 increase in service charges on deposit accounts was due primarily to increased monthly service charges that were partially offset by a decrease in nonsufficient funds fees. The $284,000 decrease in gain on sale of loans was due primarily to decreased residential mortgage refinance activity compared to the year-ago quarter. The $244,000 decrease in other noninterest income was due primarily to a decrease in lease brokerage revenue.\nThe following table presents the key components of the Company’s noninterest expense for the periods indicated:\nThree months ended March 31, (dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 $ Change\n% Change Base salaries, overtime and temporary help, net of deferred loan origination costs $13,962 $13,390 $572 4.3 % Commissions and incentives 2,452 2,198 254 11.6 % Employee benefits 5,238 5,305 (67 ) (1.3 %) Total salaries and benefits expense 21,652 20,893 759 3.6 % Occupancy 2,681 2,692 (11 ) (0.4 %) Equipment 1,551 1,723 (172 ) (10.0 %) Data processing and software 2,514 2,396 118 4.9 % ATM and POS network charges 1,226 853 373 43.7 % Telecommunications 701 643 58 9.0 % Postage 358 404 (46 ) (11.4 %) Courier service 267 254 13 5.1 % Advertising 838 967 (129 ) (13.3 %) Assessments 430 405 25 6.2 % Operational losses 294 435 (141 ) (32.4 %) Professional fees 773 766 7 0.8 % Foreclosed assets expense 24 38 (14 ) (36.8 %) Provision for (reversal of) foreclosed asset losses\n90 (66 ) 156 (236.4 %) Change in reserve for unfunded commitments 700 15 685 4566.7 % Intangible amortization 339 359 (20 ) (5.6 %) Merger and acquisition expense 476 - 476 Other miscellaneous expense 3,248 3,045 203 6.7 % Total other noninterest expense 16,510 14,929 1,581 10.6 % Total noninterest expense $38,162 $35,822 $2,340 6.5 % Average full time equivalent employees 1,002 1,015 (13 ) (1.3 %) Merger & acquisition expense: Professional fees $355 - Miscellaneous other expense 121 - Total merger & acquisition expense $476 - Salary and benefit expenses increased $759,000 (3.6%) to $21,652,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $20,893,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2017. Base salaries, net of deferred loan origination costs increased $572,000 (4.3%) to 13,962,000. The increase in base salaries was due to annual merit increases, and the addition of employees with base salaries above the average base salary that were partially offset by a 1.3% decrease in average full time equivalent employees to 1,002 from 1,015 in the year-ago quarter. Commissions and incentive compensation increased $254,000 (11.6%) to $2,452,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the year-ago quarter due primarily to increases in management, back-office and nondeposit investment product sales incentives that were partially offset by decreased commissions on loans and other sales incentives. Benefits & other compensation expense decreased $67,000 (1.3%) to $5,238,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2018 due primarily to decreases in group medical, workers compensation insurance, retirement (ESOP) expenses, that were partially offset by an increase in employer payroll tax expense.\nOther noninterest expense increased $1,581,000 (10.6%) to $16,510,000 during the three months ended March 31, 20018 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in other noninterest expense was due to the changes noted in the table above. The $685,000 increase in change in reserve for unfunded commitments was due to an increase in unfunded construction loan commitments. The $118,000 and $373,000 increases in data processing and software expense and ATM & POS network charges, respectively, were due primarily to system enhancements and capacity expansion. The $172,000 decrease in equipment expense was due to decreased equipment rental, repair and maintenance. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company incurred $476,000 of merger related expense associated with the proposed merger with FNBB of which $343,000 is nondeductible for tax purposes.\nThe effective combined Federal and State income tax rate on income was 28.1% and 37.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. This decrease in effective combined Federal and State income tax rate was due primarily to a decrease in the Federal tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The effective combined Federal and State income tax rate was greater than the Federal statutory tax rate due to State income tax expense of $2,207,000 and $2,134,000, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, that were partially offset by the effects of tax-exempt income of $1,041,000 and $1,041,000, respectively, from investment securities, $608,000 and $792,000, respectively, from increase in cash value of life insurance, low-income housing tax credits of $190,000 and $121,000, respectively, $1,000 and $90,000, respectively, of equity compensation excess tax benefits, and $343,000 of nondeductible merger expense during the three months ended March 31, 2018. The low income housing tax credits and the equity compensation excess tax benefits represent direct reductions in tax expense.\nThe provisions for income taxes applicable to net income before taxes differ from amounts computed by applying the statutory Federal income tax rates to income before taxes. The effective tax rate and the statutory federal income tax rate are reconciled for the periods indicated as follows:\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Federal statutory income tax rate 21.0% 35.0% State income taxes, net of federal tax benefit 9.0 6.9 Tax-exempt interest on municipal obligations (1.1) (1.9) Increase in cash value of insurance policies (0.7) (1.4) Low income housing tax credits (1.0) (0.6) Equity compensation - (0.5) Nondeductible merger expenses 0.4 - Other 0.5 0.3 Effective Tax Rate 28.1% 37.8% The Company’s financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). The Company uses certain non-GAAP measures to provide supplemental information regarding performance. Net income and the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 include the effects of $476,000 of expenses related to the proposed merger with FNBB, of which $343,000 is non-deductible for taxes. Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 includes no merger related expenses. The Company believes that presenting the effective tax rate, net income, return on average assets (ROAA), return on average equity (ROAE), and earnings per common share, excluding the impact of merger & acquisition expenses, provides additional clarity to the users of the financial statements regarding core financial performance. The following table presents a comparison of the effective tax rate, net income, ROAA, ROAE, and earnings per common share as reported, and as adjusted for the impact of merger & acquisition expenses, for the periods indicated.\nThree months ended March 31, ($'s in thousands except per share amounts) 2018 2017 Net income before tax $19,350 $19,431 Effect of merger expense 476 - Adjusted net income before tax $19,826 $19,431 Income tax expense $5,440 $7,352 Effect of merger expense 39 - Adjusted income tax expense $5,479 $7,352 Net income $13,910 $12,079 Effect of merger expense 437 - Adjusted net income $14,347 $12,079 Effective tax rate 28.1% 37.8% Adjusted effective tax rate 27.6% 37.8% ROAA 1.17% 1.08% Adjusted ROAA 1.21% 1.08% ROAE 11.00% 9.97% Adjusted ROAE 11.34% 9.97% Earnings per common share: Basic $0.61 $0.53 Diluted $0.60 $0.52 Adjusted earnings per common share: Basic $0.62 $0.53 Diluted $0.62 $0.52 M&A expense $476 - Non-deductible M&A expense $343 - Average assets $4,741,227 $4,493,657 Average equity $506,013 $484,811 Weighted average shares 22,956,239 22,870,467 Weighted average diluted shares 23,283,127 23,231,778 Richard P. Smith, President and CEO of the Company commented, “Our Company enjoyed another strong quarter of performance as consistent loan demand continued to provide the catalyst for revenue growth. Total loans grew by 1.8% during the quarter, or 7.2% annualized, and increased 11.2% over the prior year. Additionally, deposit growth also increased during the quarter during a period that normally sees deposit outflows. This performance is reflective of improved economic activity in our Northern California markets and generally to a more robust US and California economy.”\nSmith added, “Other key activities affecting performance in the quarter include the benefits of lower corporate taxes, increased revenues from service charges and fees on deposit accounts and ATM/interchange revenues. Most important we continue to proceed with the approval and integration of our previously announced acquisition of FNB Bank of Northern California.”\nAbout TriCo Bancshares\nEstablished in 1975, Tri Counties Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of TriCo Bancshares (NASDAQ: TCBK) headquartered in Chico, California, providing a unique brand of customer Service with Solutions available in traditional stand-alone and in-store bank branches in communities throughout Northern and Central California.

Such statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and are generally beyond the control of the Company. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting the Company will be the same as those anticipated by management. The Company cautions readers that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, such forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: the strength of the United States economy in general and the strength of the local economies in which the Company conducts operations; the effects of, and changes in, trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; inflation, interest rate, market and monetary fluctuations; the impact of changes in financial services policies, laws and regulations; technological changes; mergers and acquisitions, including costs or difficulties related to the integration of acquired companies; changes in the level of the Company’s nonperforming assets and charge-offs; any deterioration in values of California real estate, both residential and commercial; the effect of changes in accounting standards and practices; possible other-than-temporary impairment of securities held by the Company; changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; ability to attract deposits and other sources of liquidity; changes in the financial performance and/or condition of our borrowers; the impact of competition from financial and bank holding companies and other financial service providers; unanticipated regulatory or judicial proceedings; the costs and effects of litigation and of unexpected or adverse outcomes in such litigation; and the Company’s ability to manage the risks involved in the foregoing. Additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those described above can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and available in the “Investor Relations” section of our website, https://www.tcbk.com/investor-relations and in other documents we file with the SEC. Annualized, pro forma, projections and estimates are not forecasts and may not reflect actual results.\nIn addition to factors previously disclosed in reports filed by the Company and FNBB with the SEC, risks and uncertainties for the Company, FNBB and the combined company include, but are not limited to: the possibility that any of the anticipated benefits of the proposed merger will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; the risk that integration of FNBB's operations with those of the Company will be materially delayed or will be more costly or difficult than expected; the inability to close the merger in a timely manner; the inability to complete the merger due to the failure of the Company's or FNBB's shareholders to adopt the merger agreement; diversion of management's attention from ongoing business operations and opportunities; the failure to satisfy other conditions to completion of the merger, including receipt of required regulatory and other approvals; the failure of the proposed merger to close for any other reason; the challenges of integrating and retaining key employees; the effect of the announcement of the merger on the Company's, FNBB's or the combined company's respective customer relationships and operating results; the possibility that the merger may be more expensive to complete than anticipated, including as a result of unexpected factors or events; and general competitive, economic, political and market conditions and fluctuations. All forward-looking statements included in this filing are made as of the date hereof and are based on information available at the time of the filing. Except as required by law, neither the Company nor FNBB assumes any obligation to update any forward-looking statement.\nProxy Solicitation\nThe Company, FNBB, their directors, executive officers and certain other persons may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from the Company's and FNBB's shareholders in favor of the approval of the merger.

Information about the directors and executive officers of FNBB and their ownership of FNBB common stock is set forth in FNBB’s Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A, as previously filed with the SEC on April 20, 2018. Shareholders may obtain additional information regarding the interests of such participants by reading the registration statement and the proxy statement/prospectus when they become available.\nTRICO BANCSHARES - CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA (Unaudited.
