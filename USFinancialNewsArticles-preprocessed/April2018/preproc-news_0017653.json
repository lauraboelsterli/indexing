    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on Wednesday that the government would provide aluminum giant Rusal with short-term liquidity and offer other assistance to help the company weather U.S. sanctions.\nFILE PHOTO: Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov is seen before President Vladimir Putin's annual state of the nation address to the Federal Assembly in Moscow, Russia March 1, 2018. REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov Siluanov said the government was working on specific measures to support Rusal, but said there were no plans for the state to buy shares in Rusal.\nThe aluminum producer was added to a U.S. sanctions blacklist on Friday, as Washington sought to punish Moscow for its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and other “malign activity.”\nReporting by Darya Korsunskaya; Editing by Andrew Osborn\n ",
