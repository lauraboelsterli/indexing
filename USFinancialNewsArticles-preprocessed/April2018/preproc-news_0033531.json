    "text": "April 17, 2018 / 8:46 AM / Updated 2 hours ago False alarm set off Syrian air defences: pro-Assad commander Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBEIRUT (Reuters) - A false alarm led to Syrian air defence missiles being fired overnight and there was no fresh attack on Syria, a commander in the regional military alliance that backs the Syrian government told Reuters. \nSyrian state TV reported overnight that anti-aircraft defences had shot down missiles fired at an air base in the Homs area, and a media unit run by the Lebanese group Hezbollah said missiles had also targeted an air base near Damascus. \nThe commander, who spoke on condition of anonymity, attributed the malfunction to “a joint electronic attack” by Israel and the United States targeting the Syrian radar system. \nThe issue had been dealt with by Russian experts, the commander said.
