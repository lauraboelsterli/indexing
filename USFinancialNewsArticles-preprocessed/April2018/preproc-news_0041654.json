    "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea’s decision to close its nuclear test site and suspend missile tests is a “meaningful progress” for denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, South Korea’s presidential office said on Saturday.\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un said earlier the country no longer needed nuclear and missile tests and would close a nuclear test site.\n“It will also contribute to creating a very positive environment for the success of the upcoming South-North summit and North-United States summit,” a spokesman for the president’s office, Yoon Young-chan, said in a statement.\n(This version of the story was refiled to fix a typo in the headline)\nReporting by Ju-min Park; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ",
