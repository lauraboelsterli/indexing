But it wasn’t easy.\nJohn Wall led Washington with 23 points and 15 assists, and Markieff Morris scored 22 points and grabbed 11 rebounds.\nToronto led 86-85 after a back-and-forth third quarter, setting up a pressure-packed finish for the top seed in the East. The Raptors grabbed the momentum early in the fourth quarter after Wizards forward Mike Scott was called for a flagrant foul on Kyle Lowry. The Toronto point guard hit two free throws and assisted on a Miles’ 3-pointer to cap a 7-0 spurt for the Raptors.\nMiles’ second 3-pointer of the quarter put Toronto up 103-96 with just over six minutes to play. Miles finished with 12 points, and Wright added 18 points, 11 coming in the decisive fourth quarter.\nLowry set up Ibaka for a layup that gave the Raptors a 10-point lead with 1:42 to play. Washington got back within seven, but couldn’t catch back up.\nLowry had 11 points and nine assists, and DeMar DeRozan finished with 17 points for Toronto.\nThe Raptors started strong, getting out to a 14-4 lead, but were unable to separate themselves further. Wall had a pair of 3-pointers in the first quarter to bring the Wizards back. Washington led 59-55 at halftime.\nWall missed two months after undergoing knee surgery in late January. He returned for the final two weeks, but the Wizards still struggled down the stretch. They lost five of their last six, including a loss to the last-place Orlando Magic that stuck the Wizards with the eighth seed.\nThe start of the game was delayed 15 minutes by a leak in the roof that left moisture on the court.\n— Field Level Media\n ",
