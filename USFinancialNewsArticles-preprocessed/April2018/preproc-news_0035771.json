Donnelley & Sons Company (NYSE: RRD) (“RRD” or the “Company”) today announced new financial reporting segments to align with recent changes to its global operating structure. Effective with the first quarter of 2018, RRD will report its results under two new segments: Marketing Solutions, a preeminent provider of multichannel marketing activation programs, and Business Services, a premier global provider of business communications services.\nThis segment structure organizes RRD’s global product and service offerings by their common strategic purposes to best meet rapidly evolving client needs and will allow various stakeholders to more easily assess the Company’s progress against its long-term growth strategy. The two segments are designed to help companies optimize engagement with their customers across the entire customer journey – from the marketing programs that first attract and convert customers to the brand, to the critical business communications that service those customers and extend the brand over time. Together, the powerful combination of Marketing Solutions and Business Services will help RRD’s clients create consistent customer experiences across all touch points – online, offline and in-store – with reduced complexity and increased efficiency.\nPreviously, the Company reported its segments as Variable Print, Strategic Services and International, which grouped together product and service offerings that shared related internal operational features. Certain unallocated costs reported in the Company’s Corporate segment will not be impacted by the new structure.\n“We have united our capabilities under two key segments to directly align our businesses with our clients’ evolving needs and strategic objectives,” said Dan Knotts, RRD’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “This structure further leverages our extensive business portfolio to help our clients more effectively manage the complexities of personalized marketing and sustain meaningful connections with their customers across the full customer relationship. Further, we believe this realignment will accelerate growth and drive improved profitability by focusing each business on the most attractive opportunities within our large addressable markets.”\nRRD Marketing Solutions\nRRD Marketing Solutions leverages an integrated portfolio of data analytics, creative services and multichannel execution to deliver comprehensive, end-to-end solutions that drive marketing ROI. RRD’s key capabilities include:\nData Management – integrating data to set the foundation for personal marketing Advanced Analytics – uncovering meaningful insights to deliver relevant marketing Creative Services – simplifying the art of capturing customer attention Online Channels – leveraging martech to execute successful digital marketing initiatives Offline Response – maximizing the power of print to capture customer attention Onsite Services – enhancing the customer environment to educate, engage and convert\nMarketing Solutions reported net sales of $1.2 billion in 2017. This segment includes the Company’s direct mail, in-store marketing, digital print and digital solutions businesses and will be led by Doug Ryan. Doug brings over 25 years of experience in integrated marketing, including most recently having served as President of DigitasLBi North America.\nRRD Business Services\nRRD Business Services provides customized solutions at scale to help clients inform, service and transact with their customers with reduced complexity and increased efficiency. RRD’s key capabilities include:\nCommercial Print Services – full spectrum of print, assembly and fulfillment capabilities Customized Customer Communications – personalized, regulatory – compliant messaging Product and Brand Communications – comprehensive packaging and labeling solutions Business Process Services – supply chain, global outsourcing and logistics\nBusiness Services reported net sales of $5.8 billion in 2017. This segment includes commercial print, packaging, labels, statement printing, forms, logistics, supply chain management and business process outsourcing.\nThe Business Services segment will be led by John Pecaric, a 30 – year veteran of RRD who most recently served as Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. John’s previous leadership roles at RRD included President - International, and Senior Vice President of Operations.\n“We are excited about these organizational changes as they mark a pivotal next step in our ongoing strategic transformation,” Knotts continued. “The pace of innovation is accelerating and our clients are increasingly challenged to navigate the rapidly changing customer communications landscape. Through our powerful marketing solutions and business services platforms, we are providing purpose-built solutions, at scale, to help our clients improve customer engagement and drive business performance.”\nHistorical reclassified results for the new segments are included in this press release and will be available in the Company’s Form 8-K which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, supplemental slides regarding the new segments are available under the Presentation tab in the Investors section of RRD’s website at www.rrd.com .\nAbout RRD\nRRD is a leading global provider of marketing and communications services.

The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures, when presented in conjunction with comparable GAAP measures, provide useful information about its operating results and enhance the overall ability to assess the Company’s financial performance. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. RRD uses these non-GAAP measures, together with other measures of performance under GAAP, to compare the relative performance of operations in planning, budgeting and reviewing the performance of its business. Additional information relating to the adjustments for the non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP organic net sales for RRD is set forth in the attached schedules and in the Investors section of the Company’s website.\nUse of Forward-Looking Statements\nThis news release includes certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of, and subject to the safe harbor created by, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with respect to the business, strategy and plans of the Company and its expectations relating to future financial condition and performance. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about RR Donnelley management’s beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Words such as “believes,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “aims,” “potential,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “considered,” “likely,” “estimate” and variations of these words and similar future or conditional expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. While RR Donnelley believes these expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond RR Donnelley’s control. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend upon future circumstances that may or may not occur. Actual results may differ materially from RR Donnelley’s current expectations depending upon a number of factors affecting the business and risks associated with the performance of the business. These factors include such risks and uncertainties detailed in RR Donnelley’s periodic public filings with the SEC, including but not limited to those discussed under the “Risk Factors” section in RR Donnelley’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, and other filings with the SEC and in other investor communications of RR Donnelley from time to time. RR Donnelley does not undertake to and specifically declines any obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect future events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.\nR.R.
