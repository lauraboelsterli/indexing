    "text": "April 17, 2018 / 2:24 PM / Updated 39 minutes ago Bulgaria's EIG to acquire Ergo's Ukrainian travel insurance business Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nSOFIA, April 17 (Reuters) - Bulgaria’s Euroins Insurance Group (EIG), part of Eurohold Bulgaria, said on Tuesday it is acquiring the Ukraine travel insurance business of Munich Re’s Ergo as it continues to expand in emerging European markets. \nEIG did not disclose how much it would pay for ERV Ukraine but said it expected the sale to be finalised after obtaining regulatory approvals. \nSofia-based EIG operates in eight European countries, providing services for 2.5 million customers. It has been expanding through acquisitions in the past few years, buying the Ukraine and Bulgarian subsidiaries of Germany’s Talanx Group , as well as Dutch insurer Achmea’s insurance business in Bulgaria and Australian group QBE’s operations in Romania and Bulgaria. \nERV Ukraine is the second-largest travel insurance provider in the ex-Soviet country with a market share of 10.7 percent.
