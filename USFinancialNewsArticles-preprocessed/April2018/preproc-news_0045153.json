    "text": "April 20, 2018 / 8:50 AM / Updated 14 minutes ago Thai police arrest German after bomb threat to flight to Bangkok Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai police on Friday arrested a German man accused of making a bomb threat on a Nok Airlines plane bound for Bangkok, the airline said. \nThe man, who was not named, was arrested after he claimed he was carrying an explosive device in his carry-on baggage on the plane from Loei province in the northeast to Bangkok. \nThe man made the claim before the plane took off, the airline said in a statement. \nPolice have not confirmed whether the bomb threat was fake or real. \nBudget carrier Nok Air, a subsidiary of Thai Airways, said Flight DD 9705 carrying 83 passengers and five crew took off as scheduled after the man was arrested.
