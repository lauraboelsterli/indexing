REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer/Illustration/File Photo\nShares of the world’s largest payments network operator, which were up about 6 percent this year, rose 2 percent in after-hours trading.\nVisa, like smaller rival Mastercard Inc ( MA.N ), gets most of its revenue mainly through transaction fees, which is earned each time a customer swipes their credit or debit card on the company’s network.\nThe payment processor has seen a rise in card payments, benefiting from higher U.S. consumer spending and rising oil prices.\nThe company’s net operating revenue rose 13 percent to $5.07 billion, reflecting a rise in payments volume and processed transactions.\nNet income rose to $2.61 billion in the quarter ended March 31 from $430 million, a year earlier.\nEarnings per Class A share rose to $1.11 from 18 cents a year earlier.\nAnalysts on average expected $1.02, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
