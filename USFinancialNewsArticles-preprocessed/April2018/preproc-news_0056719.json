    "text": "LISLE, Ill., April 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- SunCoke Energy, Inc. (NYSE: SXC) today reported results for the first quarter 2018, which reflect strong operating performance and year-over-year improvement across all segments.\n\"We are pleased with our first quarter 2018 operating results. We continue to execute against our objectives and our strong first quarter performance is a testament to the progress we are making. We remain on pace to achieve our full-year Adjusted EBITDA guidance,\" said Mike Rippey, President and Chief Executive Officer of SunCoke Energy, Inc.\nAdditionally, SunCoke Energy Partners, L.P. today announced its first quarter distribution of $0.40 per unit, which was a reduction from the $0.5940 per unit fourth quarter distribution.\nRippey continued, \"While this will reduce the distributions SXC receives from our ownership interest in SXCP, this will allow SXCP, our largest and most significant asset, to pay down debt and strengthen its balance sheet, which will increase long-term value to shareholders. SXC maintains a solid balance sheet with significant liquidity, positive cash flows, and ability to continue to grow the business.\"\nFIRST QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\n2018\n2017\nIncrease\nRevenues\n$\n350.5\n$\n309.7\n$\n40.8\nAdjusted EBITDA (1)\n$\n64.0\n$\n55.6\n$\n8.4\nNet income attributable to SXC\n$\n8.7\n$\n1.0\n$\n7.7\n(1)\nSee definition of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciliation elsewhere in this release.\nRevenues during the first quarter 2018 increased $40.8 million compared to the prior year period, primarily reflecting the pass-through of higher coal prices and higher sales volumes in our Domestic Coke segment.\nAdjusted EBITDA during the first quarter 2018 increased $8.4 million to $64.0 million, primarily due to improved Domestic Coke performance as well as the absence of certain Corporate and Other costs incurred in the same prior year period.\nNet income attributable to SXC was $8.7 million, or $0.13 per share, for the first quarter 2018, which is $7.7 million favorable to first quarter 2017 income of $1.0 million, or $0.02 per share, driven primarily by the improved operating results described above partially offset by higher interest expense due to the 2017 debt refinancing activities.\nFIRST QUARTER SEGMENT RESULTS\nDomestic Coke\nDomestic Coke consists of cokemaking facilities and heat recovery operations at our Jewell, Indiana Harbor, Haverhill, Granite City and Middletown plants.\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n(Dollars in millions, except per ton amounts)\n2018\n2017\nIncrease\nRevenues\n$\n318.1\n$\n278.7\n$\n39.4\nAdjusted EBITDA (1)\n$\n54.3\n$\n49.7\n$\n4.6\nSales volumes (thousands of tons)\n974\n946\n28\nAdjusted EBITDA per ton (2)\n$\n55.75\n$\n52.54\n$\n3.21\n(1)\nSee definition of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciliation elsewhere in this release.\n(2)\nReflects Domestic Coke Adjusted EBITDA divided by Domestic Coke sales volumes.\nRevenues increased $39.4 million, primarily reflecting the pass-through of higher coal prices as well as higher sales volumes. Adjusted EBITDA increased $4.6 million, driven by improved operating performance of $8.9 million at our Indiana Harbor facility primarily due to higher sales volumes and favorable coal-to-coke yields from rebuilt ovens. This improvement was partially offset by $1.2 million of unfavorable coal cost recovery at our Jewell facility as well as the timing of planned outage and maintenance costs. Additionally, higher coal moisture from adverse weather and logistics conditions resulted in lower production and energy revenue at our Granite City facility.\nLogistics\nLogistics consists of the handling and mixing services of coal and other aggregates operated by SXCP at our Convent Marine Terminal (\"CMT\"), Lake Terminal and Kanawha River Terminals (\"KRT\"). Additionally, Dismal River Terminal (\"DRT\") is operated by SXC.\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\n2018\n2017\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\nRevenues\n$\n22.3\n$\n20.2\n$\n2.1\nIntersegment sales\n$\n5.4\n$\n5.1\n$\n0.3\nAdjusted EBITDA (1)\n$\n13.6\n$\n13.1\n$\n0.5\nTons handled (thousands of tons) (2)\n5,821\n5,719\n102\nCMT take-or-pay shortfall tons (thousands of tons) (3)\n172\n544\n(372)\n(1)\nSee definition of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciliation elsewhere in this release.\n(2)\nReflects inbound tons handled during the period.\n(3)\nReflects tons billed under take-or-pay contracts where services have not yet been performed.\nRevenues and Adjusted EBITDA increased by $2.1 million and $0.5 million, respectively, driven primarily by record sales volumes at CMT as well as an increase in rate on CMT take-or-pay tons in the current year period. This benefit was mostly offset by increased costs at CMT and loss of business at KRT resulting from near historic water levels during the first quarter 2018.\nBrazil Coke\nBrazil Coke consists of a cokemaking facility in Vit√≥ria, Brazil, which we operate for an affiliate of ArcelorMittal.\nRevenues and Adjusted EBITDA were $10.1 million and $4.7 million, respectively, and were reasonably consistent with the prior year period.\nCorporate and Other\nCorporate and other expenses, which include costs related to our legacy coal mining business, were $8.6 million in first quarter 2018, an improvement of $3.0 million versus first quarter 2017. This improvement was partially driven by the absence of the $1.5 million of costs in the prior year period associated with the termination of the proposal to acquire all of the Partnership's common units. Additionally, the current period benefited from lower black lung expenses, associated with our legacy coal mining business.\n2018 OUTLOOK\nOur 2018 guidance is as follows:\nDomestic coke production is expected to be approximately 3.9 million tons Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $240 million to $255 million Adjusted EBITDA attributable to SXC is expected to be between $160 million and $171 million, reflecting the impact of public ownership in SXCP Capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $95 million, including $25 to $30 million related to our Indiana Harbor oven rebuild project and approximately $35 million related to our Granite City gas sharing project Cash generated by operations is estimated to be between $150 million and $165 million Cash taxes are projected to be between $7 million and $14 million\nRELATED COMMUNICATIONS\nWe will host our quarterly earnings call at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time (10:00 a.m. Central Time) today.

(NYSE: SXC) supplies high-quality coke to the integrated steel industry under long-term, take-or-pay contracts that pass through commodity and certain operating costs to customers. We utilize an innovative heat-recovery cokemaking technology that captures excess heat for steam or electrical power generation. We are the sponsor of SunCoke Energy Partners, L.P. (\"Partnership\") (NYSE: SXCP), a publicly traded master limited partnership. At March 31, 2018, we owned the general partner of the Partnership, which consists of a 2.0 percent ownership interest and incentive distribution rights, and owned a 60.3 percent limited partner interest in the Partnership. Our cokemaking facilities are located in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Virginia, Brazil and India.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered alternatives to net income or operating income under GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures in other businesses. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of the operating performance and liquidity of the Company's net assets and its ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures and make distributions. Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors because it highlights trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP measures and because it eliminates items that have less bearing on our operating performance and liquidity. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and they should not be considered a substitute for net income, operating cash flow or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to SXC represents Adjusted EBITDA less Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nSome of the statements included in this press release constitute \" \" (as defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).
