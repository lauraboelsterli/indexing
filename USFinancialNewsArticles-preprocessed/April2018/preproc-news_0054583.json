Company has confidentially submitted a draft registration statement on Form S-1 to the U.S. Securities (the \"SEC\") relating to the proposed initial public offering of Arlo Technologies, Inc. Business outlook 1 : Company expects second quarter 2018 net revenue to be in the range of $340 million to $355 million, with GAAP operating margin in the range of (1.2)% to (0.2)% and non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%. Additionally, the Company expects the GAAP tax rate to be approximately 30.0% and non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 25.0%.\nSAN JOSE, Calif., April 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NETGEAR, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTGR), a global networking company that delivers innovative networking and Internet connected products to consumers and growing businesses, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended April 1, 2018.\nNet revenue for the first quarter ended April 1, 2018 was $345.0 million, as compared to $323.7 million in the first quarter ended April 2, 2017, and $397.1 million in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017. Net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, for the first quarter of 2018 was $5.6 million, or $0.17 net income per diluted share. This compared to GAAP net income of $16.0 million, or $0.47 net income per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017, and GAAP net loss of $31.9 million, or $1.02 net loss per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net income was $0.62 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to non-GAAP net income of $0.64 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017 and $0.71 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nOperating margin, computed in accordance with GAAP, for the first quarter of 2018 was 2.5%, as compared to 7.0% in the year ago comparable quarter, and 4.9% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP operating margin was 7.5% in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to 10.0% in the first quarter of 2017 and 7.3% in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe accompanying schedules provide a reconciliation of financial measures computed on a GAAP basis to financial measures computed on a non-GAAP basis.\nPatrick Lo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NETGEAR, commented, \"We had a successful first quarter of 2018, driven by our Orbi line, our new Nighthawk gaming router, Arlo Pro 2, and our SMB switching line. Our financial results for the quarter came in at the high end of the guidance range for revenue and operating margin. We saw year-over-year top line growth for both the Arlo and SMB segments. Meanwhile, the CHP segment showed meaningful improvement in profitability on a sequential basis, and we continue to lead the consumer WiFi market with our premium routers, gateways, mesh systems and extenders.\"\nMr. Lo continued, “Our focus remains on the successful separation of the Arlo business from NETGEAR, as well as driving our subscription services strategy for all three segments.\"\nChristine Gorjanc, Chief Financial Officer of NETGEAR, added, \"During the first quarter of 2018, we generated cash flow from operations of $57.0 million, which brings our total over the trailing twelve months to $135.3 million.”\nBusiness Outlook\nChristine Gorjanc, Chief Financial Officer of NETGEAR, added, \"Looking forward to the second quarter of 2018, we expect net revenue to be in the range of $340 million to $355 million. GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of (1.2)% to (0.2)%, which includes approximately $10.0 million of one-time costs associated with the separation which includes professional services fees for various advisory and audit related costs. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%, which includes approximately $4.0 million of costs associated with the separation of Arlo and the corresponding dis-synergies created as we hire talent to duplicate certain roles to prepare that business to stand up on its own. Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be approximately 30.0% and our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 25.0% for the second quarter of 2018.”\nA reconciliation between the Business Outlook on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is provided in the following table:\nThree months ended July 1, 2018 Operating Margin Rate Tax Rate GAAP (1.2)% - (0.2)% 30.0 % Estimated adjustments for 1 : Amortization of intangibles 0.7 % __ Stock-based compensation expense 2.6 % __ Separation expense 2.9 % __ Restructuring and other charges 0.5 % __ Tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments __ (5.0 )% Non-GAAP 5.5% - 6.5% 25.0 % 1 Business outlook does not include estimates for any currently unknown income and expense items which, by their nature, could arise late in a quarter, including: litigation reserves, net; acquisition-related charges; impairment charges; discrete tax benefits or detriments relating to tax windfalls or shortfalls from equity awards; and any additional impacts relating to the implementation of U.S. tax reform. New material income and expense items such as these could have a significant effect on our guidance and future GAAP results.

Risk Factors,” pages 10 through 31, in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, filed with the Securities on February 16, 2018. Given these circumstances, you should not place undue reliance on these NETGEAR undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any contained herein to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information:\nTo supplement our unaudited selected financial data presented on a basis consistent with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain charges, including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP research and development, non-GAAP sales and marketing, non-GAAP general and administrative, non-GAAP total operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share. These supplemental measures exclude adjustments for amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense, separation expense, restructuring and other charges, litigation reserves, net, impairment charges to investment, and the related tax effects, and the tax effects of the implementation of U.S. tax reform. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We believe that these non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measures. We compensate for the limitations of non-GAAP financial measures by relying upon GAAP results to gain a complete picture of our performance.\nIn calculating non-GAAP financial measures, we exclude certain items to facilitate a review of the comparability of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis because such items are not, in our view, related to our ongoing operational performance. We use non-GAAP measures to evaluate the operating performance of our business, for comparison with forecasts and strategic plans, and for benchmarking performance externally against competitors. In addition, management’s incentive compensation is determined using certain non-GAAP measures. Since we find these measures to be useful, we believe that investors benefit from seeing results “through the eyes” of management in addition to seeing GAAP results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when read in conjunction with our GAAP financials, provide useful information to investors by offering:\nthe ability to make more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of our on-going operating results; the ability to better identify trends in our underlying business and perform related trend analyses; a better understanding of how management plans and measures our underlying business; and an easier way to compare our operating results against analyst financial models and operating results of competitors that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures.\nThe following are explanations of the adjustments that we incorporate into non-GAAP measures, as well as the reasons for excluding them in the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures:\nAmortization of intangibles consists primarily of non-cash charges that can be impacted by, among other things, the timing and magnitude of acquisitions. We consider our operating results without these charges when evaluating our ongoing performance and forecasting our earnings trends, and therefore exclude such charges when presenting non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the assessment of our operations excluding these costs is relevant to our assessment of internal operations and comparisons to the performance of our competitors.\nStock-based compensation expense consists of non-cash charges for the estimated fair value of stock options, restricted stock units and shares under the employee stock purchase plan granted to employees. We believe that the exclusion of these charges provides for more accurate comparisons of our operating results to peer companies due to the varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. In addition, we believe it is useful to investors to understand the specific impact stock-based compensation expense has on our operating results.\nOther items consist of certain items that are the result of either unique or unplanned events, including, when applicable: separation expense, restructuring and other charges, litigation reserves, net, and impairment charges to investment. It is difficult to predict the occurrence or estimate the amount or timing of these items in advance. Although these events are reflected in our GAAP financial statements, these unique transactions may limit the comparability of our on-going operations with prior and future periods. The amounts result from events that often arise from unforeseen circumstances, which often occur outside of the ordinary course of continuing operations. Therefore, the amounts do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing business operations for the period in which they are incurred.\nTax effects consist of the various above adjustments and the charge relating to the implementation of U.S. tax reform that we incorporate into non-GAAP measures in order to provide a more meaningful measure on non-GAAP net income. We also believe providing financial information with and without the income tax effects relating to our non-GAAP financial measures provides our management and users of the financial statements with better clarity regarding the on-going performance of our business.\nSource: NETGEAR-F\n-Financial Tables Attached- NETGEAR, INC.
