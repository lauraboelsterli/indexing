    "text": "Shareholder Value Eroded . Herschel Segal, the principal shareholder of DavidsTea Inc. (Nasdaq:DTEA) through his holding company Rainy Day Investments Ltd. (“ RDI ”), believes that poor operating decisions and unproductive leadership by the Board of Directors and management of DavidsTea have greatly eroded shareholder value . Operating losses continue each quarter, and for the most recent fiscal year, were approximately four times greater than in the previous year. Financial results continue to be deeply disturbing. The status quo is not an option .\nA Vision for DavidsTea . Herschel Segal believes in the future of DavidsTea. His vision for DavidsTea is to build on its strengths, including a well-known brand, a loyal customer base across Canada and passionate employees, while addressing weaknesses such as U.S. operations and excessive product and organizational costs. With the right focus, DavidsTea can restore growth, position itself on a sustainable path, and create value for the long-term – for shareholders, customers and employees. The economy is strong, the DavidsTea brand resonates with a new generation of consumers, and the tea business offers compelling opportunities for creating long-term shareholder value. By focusing on the right priorities, DavidsTea can aspire to a great future as an iconic Canadian brand.\nFocus on Operations and Financial Turnaround . In Mr. Segal’s view, DavidsTea’s priority should be a turnaround of its financial performance through improved operations, and not a continuing strategic review process, the end goal of which is to sell all or part of the business. The operational objective should be a “best in class” customer experience which results in a turnaround of DavidsTea’s financial performance.\nUnified Board of Directors . In order to improve operations and effect a financial turnaround, a unified Board of Directors is needed, one which shares a common vision for DavidsTea’s future. The strategic review process favoured by the current Board of Directors has run its course; DavidsTea and the Board of Directors need to get to work immediately to revitalize the business. With a new, unified Board of Directors, DavidsTea will be able to make substantial progress in improving operations and financial performance, for the benefit of all shareholders. Herschel Segal, through RDI, has proposed a slate of new directors who will work in the best interests of all DavidsTea shareholders.\nQuality Candidates . The seven nominees proposed by RDI bring impeccable credentials in retailing and finance and vast business experience to DavidsTea’s governance. A clear majority of the nominees are independent of Herschel Segal and RDI. They share a common vision for DavidsTea and a belief in its future.\nMONTREAL, April 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rainy Day Investments Ltd. (“ RDI ”), the principal shareholder of DavidsTea Inc. (“ DavidsTea ”) (Nasdaq:DTEA), announces that it today formally submitted to DavidsTea the names of seven nominees (the “ Proposed Nominees ”) for election to the Board of Directors of DavidsTea at the annual meeting of shareholders to be held on June 14, 2018 (the “ Meeting ”). RDI submitted the names of the Proposed Nominees in accordance with Article 11 of By-law 2015-1 of DavidsTea, the “advance notice” provision. RDI currently exercises control and direction over 11,973,681 common shares of DavidsTea (“ DavidsTea Shares ”), representing approximately 46.23% of the outstanding DavidsTea Shares. RDI is the holding company of Mr. Herschel Segal, a founder of DavidsTea and a director until March 5, 2018.\nA Need for Change at DavidsTea\nHerschel Segal resigned from the Board of Directors of DavidsTea on March 5 due to his belief that a majority of the current Board members do not share his vision for a financial turnaround of DavidsTea through a focus on improving operations; they instead consider a continuing strategic review process to be DavidsTea’s priority. Mr. Segal concluded that in order to revitalize DavidsTea’s operations, RDI had to propose a slate of new directors sharing his vision for, and long-term commitment to, DavidsTea.\nMr. Segal believes that DavidsTea must focus on an operational and financial turnaround that positions DavidsTea on a sustainable path and creates long-term value – for shareholders, customers and employees. With a new, unified Board of Directors sharing this common vision, Mr. Segal believes that DavidsTea can aspire to a great future as an iconic Canadian brand.\nHerschel Segal’s fundamental conviction is that good products and satisfied customers are basic ingredients for a profitable business. The leadership of DavidsTea needs to rebuild the corporate culture, from the boardroom to the store and online sales channels, to deliver a variety of quality products priced as a good-value proposition for the consumer, and with empathetic, enthusiastic communication with the customer. These straightforward principles will lead to a strengthening of DavidsTea’s retail operations in Canada and the United States, as well as the virtual online shopping experience.\nDavidsTea is at a critical juncture; the status quo is not an option. Herschel Segal wants, and DavidsTea needs, a unified Board of Directors committed to an operational and financial turnaround built upon straightforward, fundamental principles. It’s time to get to work on turning around DavidsTea.\nAt the Meeting on June 14, shareholders will have an opportunity to affect DavidsTea’s future by voting for the seven Proposed Nominees. This election is perhaps the most important in DavidsTea’s history. A vote for the Proposed Nominees will start the process by which DavidsTea can achieve its great potential.\nOperational and Financial Turnaround Plan\nHerschel Segal believes that the tea industry is growing, consumers in Canada and the United States are increasingly health conscious and aware of the benefits of specialty teas, and DavidsTea has a well-recognized brand name and a loyal customer base across Canada, all of which are important factors for an operational and financial turnaround. Mr. Segal further believes that the basis for a financial turnaround is a focus on DavidsTea’s operations, with good products and satisfied customers. Specifically, Mr. Segal believes that DavidsTea can effect an operational and financial turnaround as follows:\nFocus on and listen to the customer , enhance the customer experience and make sure that customers are satisfied Provide excellent products at a compelling price by rebuilding DavidsTea’s buying department and improving the efficiency of product purchasing Create ongoing, two-way communication between DavidsTea’s head office and its stores, and provide support to the stores and their personnel Focus on the Canadian market , where the DavidsTea brand has been successful, and expand the number of stores in Canada Stabilize operations in the United States Reduce overhead costs , including a reduction of head office personnel Assess DavidsTea’s senior management and make any necessary changes Provide clear direction from the Board of Directors to senior management and employees\nBackground\nIn early March 2018, DavidsTea asked that RDI provide the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors with the names of RDI’s proposed nominees for election to the Board of Directors at the Meeting.\nOn March 12, 2018, after the close of the markets, RDI issued a press release announcing that it intended to submit a slate of nominees to DavidsTea for election as the Board of Directors.\nIn the March 12 press release, RDI reiterated its statement of February 20, 2018 that RDI has no intention of selling its shares of DavidsTea at this time.\nOn March 19, 2018, RDI submitted a slate of nominees to the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee for election as the Board of Directors of DavidsTea at the Meeting, and issued a press release announcing that it had done so.\nIn the March 19 press release, Herschel Segal stated, “This is a slate of quality candidates with a common vision for DavidsTea and with the competencies and experience necessary for a turn-around of the company, for the benefit of all DavidsTea shareholders.” Mr. Segal further noted that a clear majority of the nominees are independent of RDI.\nRDI’s Compromise Proposal to the Board of Directors\nRDI and its legal counsel then initiated discussions with the Board of Directors of DavidsTea and with three minority shareholders, each of whom owns more than 10% of the DavidsTea Shares, with the objective of reaching an agreement with them on a slate of nominees for election as the Board of Directors of DavidsTea. As a compromise, RDI proposed a slate of nine nominees, consisting of: five nominees of RDI; three nominees to be proposed by the Board of Directors and/or the minority shareholders; and the Chief Executive Officer of DavidsTea. Both the Board of Directors and three minority shareholders refused this compromise slate of nominees. Accordingly, RDI today formally submitted the names of seven Proposed Nominees in accordance with Article 11 of By‑law 2015-1 of DavidsTea, the “advance notice” provision.\nRDI’s Independent and Experienced Board Nominees\nHerschel Segal leads the slate of Proposed Nominees. If the slate is elected at the Meeting, it is expected that Mr. Segal will be appointed as Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of DavidsTea. The six other Proposed Nominees are: M. William Cleman, a corporate director and consultant; Pat De Marco, President of Viau Foods Inc., located in Laval, Québec; Emilia Di Raddo, President of Le Château Inc., a leading Canadian fashion retailer based in Montreal, Québec; Dr. Ludwig Max Fisher, a retired professor with an interest in holistic nutrition and herbal medicine; Dr. Peter Robinson, until recently CEO of the David Suzuki Foundation and prior thereto CEO of Mountain Equipment Co-op, a Canadian consumers’ cooperative; and Roland Walton, former President of Tim Horton’s Canada.\nThe Proposed Nominees were invited to serve in light of their diverse skills and experience and their commitment to an operational and financial turnaround of DavidsTea. The Proposed Nominees collectively have expertise in the retail industry, financial expertise, and experience with public companies and other large organizations. Herschel Segal believes that a Board of Directors comprised of the Proposed Nominees will be able to provide clear direction to DavidsTea’s senior management and employees and is confident that the Proposed Nominees will help DavidsTea effect an operational and financial turnaround.\nAt present, all of the Proposed Nominees are “independent” within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities regulations and Nasdaq rules. If Herschel Segal is appointed as Executive Chairman of the Board after the Meeting, a clear majority of the Proposed Nominees will be “independent.” In addition, at least three, if not more, of the Proposed Nominees are “financially literate” and “independent” within the meaning of Canadian securities regulations and Nasdaq rules and have the skills required in order to be members of the Audit Committee of DavidsTea.\nThe information set out below with respect to each Proposed Nominee has been provided by such Proposed Nominee as at April 19, 2018.
