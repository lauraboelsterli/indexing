Yulia Skripal/Facebook via REUTERS \nIn a statement issued on her behalf by British police, Skripal said her father remained seriously ill and she was still suffering from the effects of nerve gas used against them in an attack that led to one of the biggest crises in Britain’s relations with Moscow since the Cold War. \n“I have access to friends and family, and I have been made aware of my specific contacts at the Russian Embassy who have kindly offered me their assistance in any way they can,” Yulia Skripal said. \n“At the moment I do not wish to avail myself of their services, but, if I change my mind I know how to contact them.” \nThe Russian Embassy in London has previously said it had not been granted consular access to the 33 year-old woman.

Yulia Skripal/Facebook via REUTERS \nYulia Skripal was discharged from a hospital in the English city of Salisbury on Monday, where, she said, she was treated “ with obvious clinical expertise and with such kindness”. \nSkripal said she was not yet strong enough to give a media interview and she said comments made by her cousin to Russian media were not her’s nor those of her father. \n“I thank my cousin Viktoria for her concern for us, but ask that she does not visit me or try to contact me for the time being,” the statement quoted her as saying. \nThe Skripals were in a critical condition for weeks after the March 4 attack before their health improved. \nBritain accused Russia of being behind the nerve agent attack and Western governments including the United States expelled more than 100 Russian diplomats. Russia has denied any involvement in the poisoning and retaliated in kind. Writing by William Schomberg; Editing by Angus MacSwan",
