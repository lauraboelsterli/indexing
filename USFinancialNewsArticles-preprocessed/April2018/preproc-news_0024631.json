    "text": "April 12, 2018 / 12:31 AM / Updated 21 minutes ago BOJ's Kuroda offers upbeat view on prices, keeps pledge on easy policy Leika Kihara 3 Min Read \nTOKYO (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda on Thursday stressed his resolve to maintain the central bank’s massive stimulus programme, even as he offered an optimistic view on prospects for meeting his 2 percent inflation target. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda enters a news conference room in Tokyo, Japan, April 9, 2018. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon \nKuroda said Japan’s economy will continue expanding moderately as rising household income drives up spending. \n“With the output gap improving and medium- to long-term inflation expectations seen heightening, we expect inflation to accelerate as a trend and head toward 2 percent,” Kuroda told a quarterly meeting of the BOJ’s regional branch managers. \nThe BOJ will maintain its ultra-loose policy “until needed to stably and sustainably achieve” its target, Kuroda said. \nA senior BOJ official also told parliament on Thursday that there were promising signs in the economy that would help the bank meet its elusive price goal. \n“Medium- and long-term inflation expectations are recently emerging from weaknesses, while wages and inflation are rising moderately,” said BOJ Executive Director Eiji Maeda. Related Coverage Japan's inflation expectations emerging from weaknesses - BOJ official \n“Japan’s economy is making steady progress toward achieving the BOJ’s 2 percent inflation target,” said Maeda, who oversees the central bank’s monetary policy drafting. \nBesides targeting lower corporate borrowing costs, the BOJ’s easy policy aims to heighten inflation expectations - or change public perceptions that deflation will persist - by showing the central bank’s determination to keep printing money aggressively. \nJapan’s economy expanded an annualised 1.6 percent in the October-December quarter, marking the eighth straight quarter of growth, on robust global demand and capital spending. \nBut core consumer inflation stood at 1.0 percent in February, well below the BOJ’s 2 percent target, as slow wage growth keeps consumers from boosting spending. \nThe BOJ’s branch managers will release a report at 2 p.m. (0500 GMT) analysing how the bank’s easy policy is affecting regional economies in Japan. The report will be among factors the central bank’s board will assess at its rate review this month. Reporting by Leika Kihara; Editing by Chang-Ran Kim & Shri Navaratnam",
