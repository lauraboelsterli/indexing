    "text": "Solace to provide messaging backbone for CORE's work supporting worldwide IoT implementation for the air cargo industry\nOTTAWA, Ontario, April 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Solace , a leading provider of data movement technology, and CORE Transport Technologies , a transportation-focused agile software developer, today announced an expanded partnership to support real-time tracking for unit load devices (ULDs) in the air transport industry. Building on their 12-year partnership, Solace and CORE's innovative offering will help air carriers effectively implement and manage Internet of Things (IoT) devices for improved monitoring, tracking and routing of shipments.\n\"We're excited to further our partnership with Solace to support CORE's global rollout of ULD tracking across the air transport industry,\" began Ian Craig, Managing Director at CORE. \"There is no denying the power of IoT in optimizing air carriers' shipping processes and operations, and Solace provides the secure and scalable messaging backbone needed for what could become one of the largest IoT implementations in the world.\"\nCORE's software, powered by Solace's Virtual Message Router in Microsoft Azure and in part by its award-winning enterprise-grade messaging as a service product Solace Cloud, allows logistics companies to effectively synchronize and exchange critical information in real-time, updating users on the status of their deliveries as well as potential logistical problems.\nCurrently in active roll-out with one of the three largest North American airlines, this technology drives smarter analytics, deeper visualizations and more effective command-and-control functions that improve transparency of air cargo shipments.\n\"From severe weather to security issues, there are a number of factors that can impact air cargo deliveries,\" said Shawn McAllister, CTO at Solace. \"While IoT is helping air carriers spot these problems, they still need to invest in the right supporting technologies for efficient and secure communications between all the moving parts. Our deepening partnership with CORE helps air carriers make faster, smarter decisions to ultimately deliver better customer experiences.\"\nAbout Solace\nSolace's smart data movement technologies use open APIs and protocols to rapidly and reliably route information between applications, devices and people across clouds.
