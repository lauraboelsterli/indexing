THESE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED UPON RMR’S PRESENT BELIEFS AND EXPECTATIONS, BUT THESE STATEMENTS AND THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE STATEMENTS ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO OCCUR AND MAY NOT OCCUR FOR VARIOUS REASONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND RMR’S CONTROL. FOR EXAMPLE, THIS PRESS RELEASE STATES THAT RMR’S REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND IS $0.25 PER SHARE ($1.00/SHARE PER YEAR) ON RMR CLASS A COMMON STOCK AND CLASS B-1 COMMON STOCK. A POSSIBLE IMPLICATION OF THIS STATEMENT IS THAT RMR WILL CONTINUOUSLY PAY QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS OF $0.25/SHARE PER QUARTER OR $1.00/SHARE PER YEAR IN THE FUTURE. RMR’S DIVIDEND RATES ARE SET AND RESET FROM TIME TO TIME BY RMR’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE RMR BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONSIDERS MANY FACTORS WHEN SETTING DIVIDEND RATES INCLUDING RMR’S CURRENT AND EXPECTED EARNINGS AS WELL AS THE AVAILABILITY OF CASH TO FUND DIVIDENDS AS COMPARED TO ALTERNATIVE USES OF SUCH CASH. ACCORDINGLY, FUTURE DIVIDEND RATES MAY BE INCREASED OR DECREASED AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE RATE AT WHICH FUTURE DIVIDENDS WILL BE DECLARED AND PAID. FOR THESE REASONS, AMONG OTHERS, INVESTORS ARE CAUTIONED NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE UPON ANY FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS PRESS RELEASE.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180419005130/en/\nThe RMR Group Inc.\nTimothy A.
