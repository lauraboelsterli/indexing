He will play an integral part in helping us achieve our mission of bringing novel therapies to market that address the growing threat of multidrug-resistant bacteria.”\nPrior to joining Spero Therapeutics, Dr. Critchley served as Vice President of Clinical Microbiology at Allergan plc since 2015, where he managed pre-clinical and clinical microbiology studies on anti-infective compounds including Teflaro®, Avycaz®, and Dalvance®.
