    "text": "PHILADELPHIA, April 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Beneficial Bancorp, Inc. (“Beneficial”) (NASDAQ:BNCL), the parent company of Beneficial Bank (the “Bank”), today announced its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Beneficial recorded net income of $9.8 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to net income of $8.4 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nOn April 19, 2018, the Company declared a cash dividend of 6 cents per share, payable on or after May 10, 2018, to common shareholders of record at the close of business on April 30, 2018.\nHighlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, are as follows:\nNet interest margin totaled 3.20% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to 3.04% for the same period in 2017. Net interest income increased $2.4 million, or 6.0%, for the quarter compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest margin and net interest income increased primarily due to higher yields on the investment and loan portfolios following three Federal Reserve Bank federal funds rate increases of 25 basis points in 2017.\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2018, our loan portfolio decreased $30.7 million, or 0.8%, as a result of increases in our core commercial real estate and C&I portfolios of 1.3% and 4.4%, respectively, which were more than offset by decreases in our shared national credit and consumer loan portfolios.\nCharge-offs continue to remain low. Net charge-offs for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, totaled $1.2 million, or 12 basis points annualized of average loans, compared to net charge-offs of $766 thousand, or 8 basis points annualized of average loans, in the same period in the 2017.\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company recorded a $308 thousand net gain on the sale of $4.7 million of the guaranteed portion of SBA loans.\nAsset quality metrics continued to remain strong with a non-performing assets to total assets, excluding government guaranteed student loans, of 0.41% at March 31, 2018. Our allowance for loan losses totaled $43.1 million, or 1.08% of total loans, as of March 31, 2018, compared to $43.3 million, or 1.07% of total loans, as of December 31, 2017.\nOur effective tax rate decreased to 22.3% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 29.6% in the first quarter of 2017 as a result of H.R. 1, which was enacted on December 22, 2017 and lowered the federal corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%.\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company purchased 715,600 shares of its common stock under its previously announced stock repurchase plan. Our tangible capital to tangible assets decreased to 15.02% at March 31, 2018, compared to 15.07% at March 31, 2017. The decrease in this ratio can be attributed to share repurchases and cash dividends. Tangible book value per share totaled $11.21 at March 31, 2018.\nGerard Cuddy, Beneficial’s President and CEO, stated “Our financial results continue to improve, driven by a rise in interest rates, continued favorable asset quality and management of our expense base. Organic growth continues to be a challenge. We are seeing some growth in our commercial lending businesses, but the pace of growth has slowed. We are working diligently to build out the Neumann Finance team and infrastructure and expect to start booking leases in the second half of 2018 to positively impact revenue growth.”\nBalance Sheet\nTotal assets decreased $9.9 million, or 0.2%, to $5.79 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $5.80 billion at December 31, 2017. The decrease in total assets was primarily due to a decrease in total investment securities and loans, partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents.\nCash and cash equivalents increased $45.1 million, or 8.1%, to $602.7 million at March 31, 2018, from $557.6 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily driven by investment maturities and repayments and a decrease in our total loan portfolio.\nInvestments decreased $28.2 million, or 3.2%, to $842.6 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $870.8 million at December 31, 2017, as we continued to focus on improving our balance sheet mix by reducing the percentage of our assets in investments and growing our loan portfolio. We continue to focus on maintaining a high quality investment portfolio that provides a steady stream of cash flows both in the current and in rising interest rate environments.\nLoans decreased $30.7 million, or 0.8%, to $4.00 billion at March 31, 2018, from $4.03 billion at December 31, 2017. During the quarter ended March 31, 2018, our commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loan portfolios increased $21.6 million, representing 1.3% growth, and $20.5 million, representing 4.4% growth, respectively. However, this growth was offset by decreases in our consumer loan portfolios and our shared national credit portfolio. The $31.4 million decrease in our total consumer loan portfolio was due primarily to a $17.7 million decrease in indirect auto loans resulting from our planned run-off of this portfolio segment. As previously disclosed, we decided to exit the indirect lending business in the first quarter of 2017.\nDeposits increased $37.6 million, or 0.9%, to $4.19 billion at March 31, 2018, from $4.15 billion at December 31, 2017. Growth in deposits was achieved primarily by a $77.6 million increase in core deposits and a $12.9 million increase in time deposits, partially offset by the maturity of $51.1 million of brokered certificates of deposit. The increase in core deposits was also attributable to $43.2 million of tax refunds.\nBorrowings decreased $25.4 million to $515.0 million at March 31, 2018. During the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company paid off $25.8 million of a higher cost trust preferred debenture.\nStockholders’ equity decreased $18.7 million, or 1.8%, to $1.02 billion at March 31, 2018, from $1.03 billion at December 31, 2017. The decrease in stockholders’ equity was primarily due the declaration of cash dividends and stock repurchases, partially offset by net income of $9.8 million.\nNet Interest Income\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, net interest income was $43.2 million, an increase of $2.4 million, or 6.0%, from the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in average interest earning assets of $36.6 million, primarily loans, and higher yields on the investment and loan portfolios following three Federal Reserve Bank federal funds rate increases of 25 basis points in 2017. The Company paid off $25.8 million of a higher cost trust preferred debenture during the quarter. The net interest margin totaled 3.20% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 as compared to 3.04% for the same period in 2017. During the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the net interest margin was positively impacted by 5 basis points due to loan prepayments compared to a 2 basis point positive impact during the quarter ended March 31, 2017 related to loan prepayments. Also during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the net interest margin was negatively impacted 15 basis points by higher cash levels due to slower than anticipated loan growth as average cash for the quarter totaled $537.6 million, an increase of $276.0 million from $261.6 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nNon-interest Income\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, non-interest income totaled $6.7 million, a decrease of $404 thousand, or 5.7%, from the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a $308 thousand net gain on the sale of $4.7 million of SBA loans recorded during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to a $654 thousand net gain on the sale of $7.3 million of SBA loans recorded during the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nNon-interest Expense\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, non-interest expense totaled $36.4 million, an increase of $990 thousand, or 2.8%, from the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $1.1 million due primarily to enhanced medical coverage provided to our entire employee base, annual merit increases, and the costs associated with the formation of Neumann Finance. Marketing expense increased $818 thousand to $1.9 million due to the production and airing of a new television commercial. Other expenses decreased $529 thousand primarily from declines in training and on-line banking expenses.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $2.8 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 22.3%, compared to a provision for income taxes of $3.5 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 29.6%, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period a year ago is primarily due to the passage of H.R. 1, which was enacted on December 22, 2017 and lowered the federal corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%.\nAsset Quality\nNon-accruing loans, excluding government guaranteed student loans, increased $2.8 million to $23.3 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $20.5 million at December 31, 2017. Our ratio of non-performing assets to total assets, excluding government guaranteed student loans, increased to 0.41% at March 31, 2018, compared to 0.36% at December 31, 2017. As a result of charge-offs, we recorded a $999 thousand provision for loan losses during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to a $600 thousand provision for loan losses during the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Our allowance for loan losses totaled $43.1 million, or 1.08% of total loans, as of March 31, 2018, compared to $43.3 million, or 1.07% of total loans, as of December 31, 2017, and $43.1 million, or 1.06% of total loans, as of March 31, 2017.\nCapital\nBeneficial’s and the Bank’s capital position remains strong relative to current regulatory requirements. Beneficial and the Bank continue to have substantial liquidity that has been retained in cash or invested in high quality government-backed securities. As of March 31, 2018, Beneficial’s tangible capital to tangible assets totaled 15.02%. In addition, at March 31, 2018, we had the ability to borrow up to $2.2 billion combined from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.
