    "text": "OLNEY, Md., Sandy Spring Bancorp, Inc., (Nasdaq:SASR), the parent company of Sandy Spring Bank, today reported net income for the first quarter of 2018 of $21.7 million ($0.61 per diluted share) compared to net income of $15.1 million ($0.63 per diluted share) for the first quarter of 2017 and net income of $8.3 million ($0.34 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter of 2017. The current quarter’s results included the impact of $9.0 million in merger expenses. Exclusive of the after-tax impact of these expenses, earnings per diluted share would have been approximately $0.80 per share. The prior quarter’s results included $5.6 million in additional income tax expense from the revaluation of deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate under the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as $1.8 million in post-tax merger expenses. Fourth quarter 2017 earnings per share would have been approximately $0.64 per share excluding the combined impact of these items. (Please refer to the Non-GAAP Reconciliation table included with this release for details on the earnings impact of merger related expenses and additional income tax expense related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act).\nOn January 1, 2018, Sandy Spring Bancorp completed its acquisition of WashingtonFirst Bankshares, Inc. (“WashingtonFirst”) of Reston, Virginia. The results of operations from this acquisition have been included in the consolidated results of operations from the date of the acquisition. The first quarter of 2018 reflects increased levels of average and actual balances, income and expense as compared to the first quarter of 2017. At the acquisition date, WashingtonFirst had assets of $2.1 billion, loans of $1.7 billion and deposits of $1.6 billion. As a result of the growth in the balance sheet, interest income and expense increased from the prior year. Cost savings from the synergies resulting from the combination of the institutions will continue to be realized throughout 2018.\n“Our strong quarterly performance demonstrates the value of the recently completed acquisition and our ability to effectively execute on a key part of our overall growth strategy,” said Daniel J. Schrider, President and Chief Executive Officer. “As we mark our 150th anniversary this year, we remain true to what has always driven our success.”\n“We are focused on building long-lasting client relationships by helping people and businesses reach their financial goals,” added Schrider. “Providing personalized and remarkable service to all of our clients is what will continue to set us apart as a premier bank in the Greater Washington region and what will continue to drive our future growth.”\nFirst Quarter Highlights:\nTotal assets, loans and deposits grew by 52%, 52% and 48%, respectively compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the acquisition.\nFirst quarter results reflected an annualized return on average assets of 1.12% and annualized return on average equity of 8.70% as compared to 1.20% and 11.45% respectively for the first quarter of 2017. Exclusive of merger costs on an after tax basis, the return on average assets and return on average equity would have been 1.47% and 11.40%, respectively.\nThe net interest margin was 3.58% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 3.51% for the first quarter of 2017 and 3.57% for the fourth quarter of 2017. The fourth quarter’s interest margin would have been 3.53% after excluding the recovery of interest income from a previously charged-off loan.\nPre-tax merger expenses recognized in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $9.0 million compared to $2.9 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe effective tax rate for the current quarter was 23.6% compared to 33.5% for the same quarter of the prior year.\nTangible book value declined 5% at the end of the first quarter to $19.12 per share as compared to $20.18 at the end of 2017 as a result of the acquisition.\nThe Non-GAAP efficiency ratio which excludes merger costs was 49.54% for the current quarter as compared to 54.78% for the first quarter of 2017 and 55.69% for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nReview of Balance Sheet and Credit Quality\nAs a result of the WashingtonFirst acquisition, total assets grew to $7.9 billion at March 31, 2018 as compared to $5.2 billion at March 31, 2017. Total loans at March 31, 2018 were $6.1 billion compared to $4.0 billion at March 31, 2017. Organic loan growth during the first quarter of 2018 was $0.1 billion. This growth is net of $60 million in portfolio sales during the quarter from mortgage loans held for investment.\nCombined noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing checking account balances at March 31, 2018, an important performance driver of multiple-product banking relationships with clients, increased by 36% compared to balances at March 31, 2017.\nTangible common equity totaled $678 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $463 million at March 31, 2017. The asset and equity growth from the merger was affected by the growth in intangibles associated with the recent acquisition resulting in a decline in the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets to 8.99% at March 31, 2018 as compared to 9.06% at March 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, the Company had a total risk-based capital ratio of 12.27%, a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 10.92%, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.08% and a tier 1 leverage ratio of 9.21%.\nThe level of non-performing loans to total loans decreased to 0.48% at March 31, 2018, compared to 0.77% at March 31, 2017, as a result of the growth in the loan portfolio. At March 31, 2018, non-performing loans totaled $29.4 million compared to $30.9 million at March 31, 2017, and $29.3 million at December 31, 2017. Non-performing loans include accruing loans 90 days or more past due and restructured loans, but exclude loans that were considered non-performing from the acquired loan portfolios.\nLoan charge-offs, net of recoveries, totaled $0.3 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.4 million for the first quarter of 2017. The allowance for loan losses represented 0.77% of outstanding loans and 160% of non-performing loans at March 31, 2018, compared to 1.10% of outstanding loans and 142% of non-performing loans at March 31, 2017. The decline in the allowance to outstanding loans ratio is the result of the accounting for credit losses on the loans acquired in the WashingtonFirst acquisition as any incurred credit losses have been embedded in the determination of the fair values of those loans.\nIncome Statement Review\nNet interest income for the first quarter of 2018 increased 56% compared to the first quarter of 2017 as a result of the WashingtonFirst acquisition and, to a lesser extent, the Company’s organic loan growth during the period. The net interest margin improved to 3.58% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 3.51% for the first quarter of 2017.\nThe provision for loan losses was $2.0 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.2 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $0.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in the provision reflects the impact of organic loan growth during the first quarter of 2018.\nNon-interest income increased 36% for the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2017. The current quarter included $1.6 million in BOLI life insurance proceeds. Exclusive of these proceeds, the growth in non-interest income for the quarter was 23% or $2.8 million compared to the prior year quarter. The majority of this increase was derived from mortgage banking activities and, to a lesser extent, wealth management income and bank card fees. The increase in mortgage banking activities is attributable to the increased origination volume associated with the mortgage lending operations acquired as part of the WashingtonFirst acquisition.\nNon-interest expenses increased 66% to $49.6 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $30.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in non-interest expense excluding merger expenses is 36%, primarily in compensation and facility costs. The non-GAAP efficiency ratio was 49.54% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 54.78% for the first quarter of 2017 as a result of the growth in net interest income.\nThe recently enacted tax legislation resulted in a significant tax rate reduction. This reduction has provided a net income benefit in the current quarter and this benefit will continue to affect future periods. The resultant effective tax rate at March 31, 2018 was 23.6% as compared to 33.5% at March 31, 2017.\nExplanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nReported amounts are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). The Company’s management believes that the supplemental non-GAAP information, which consists of reported net income excluding merger related expenses and additional income tax expense related to the recently enacted Tax Reform, which can vary from period to period, provides a better comparison of period to period operating performance. Additionally, the Company believes this information is utilized by regulators and market analysts to evaluate a company’s financial condition and therefore, such information is useful to investors. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial results in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures which may be presented by other companies. Please refer to Non-GAAP Reconciliation table included with this release for details on the earnings impact of these items.\nConference Call\nThe Company’s management will host a conference call to discuss its first quarter results today at 2:00 P.M.
