    "text": "ESCONDIDO, Calif., April 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OSS (NASDAQ:OSS), a leading provider of high performance computing systems, has appointed company director, David Raun, as chair of its audit committee. The appointment is expected to become effective as of the company’s annual meeting of stockholders to be held on May 22, 2018.\nRaun, who serves as member of the audit committee, will replace current audit chair, William Carpenter, who is retiring from the board. Following the changes, the board will be comprised of six members with five independent directors. The audit committee will be comprised of three members.\n\"We are fortunate to have David assume the chair of our audit committee, given his more than 23 years of executive and board experience in the technology industry,” said OSS president and CEO, Steve Cooper. \"We would also like to express our deep and sincere appreciation for Bill’s important contributions to OSS, as both an investor for 15 years and a board member for the last 10 years.”\n“I have been honored to serve OSS over the years and am very proud of what we’ve have accomplished, especially now as a publicly-traded company on the Nasdaq,” said Carpenter. “I wish the company continued success, and leave it in the very capable hands of management and the board of directors at this exciting stage of its growth and development.”\nRaun also serves as president, COO, and interim CFO of ASSIA, a provider of broadband and wireless home network solutions.
