With Dana’s sales leadership and guidance, our goal is to become one of the industry leaders for biosolids treatment technology.”\n“As I learned more about BCR and the company’s patented technologies, I wanted to be a part of the team and help drive the expansion across North America,” said Mr. Hicks. “The technology portfolio offers solutions that fit a range of unique requirements. The CleanB® and Neutralizer® are innovative alternatives to processing of municipal biosolids. A process that has historically taken a month or more to accomplish can now be completed in a matter of hours at far less cost using BCR advanced oxidation technologies. The BIO-SCRU Class A biosolids dryer provides reliable, cost-effective drying of dewatered sludge in a compact footprint compared to other drying technologies.”\nPreviously Mr. Hicks worked for wastewater treatment equipment leaders, Huber Technology and Wedeco UV Technologies in general management and sales leadership positions. In addition, he served as Managing Director at Perlitz Strategy Group, where he led consulting engagements with industrial manufacturers and the implementation of innovation process management systems. At these companies, he engaged with stakeholders at municipalities, engineering service providers, contractors, and manufacturer’s reps.\nA graduate of Georgia Tech, Mr. Hicks earned his Bachelors degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering and studied on a one-year scholarship at the Technical University of Berlin.\nWastewater treatment plant leaders, engineers who specify WWTP technologies, contractors and others who wish to discuss current or future projects may reach Mr. Hicks at dhicks@bcrinc.com .\nAbout BCR:\nBCR partners with municipalities and the engineers who research, test and purchase biosolids treatment technology.
