    "text": "BRASILIA, April 11 (Reuters) - Shareholders in Brazilâ€™s Oi SA will be diluted by 72.12 percent, the indebted phone carrier said on Wednesday, after receiving information regarding the option chosen by bondholders to receive their credits.\nThat is a slightly larger dilution ratio than a preliminary estimate of 71 percent published last month.\nOi filed for bankruptcy protection in 2016 and received approval from shareholders for its recovery plan last December.\nThe company said bondholders who gave an indication of their option hold around $8.463 billion in credits.
