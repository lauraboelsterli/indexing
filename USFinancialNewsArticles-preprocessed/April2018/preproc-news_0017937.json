    "text": "April 10, 2018 / 2:09 AM / Updated 2 minutes ago China's Xi promises to lower tariffs this year, open economy further Kevin Yao 2 Min Read \nBOAO, China (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday promised to open the country’s economy further and lower import tariffs on products including cars, in a speech that comes amid rising trade tensions between China and the United States. Chinese President Xi Jinping speaks at the closing session of the National People's Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China March 20, 2018. REUTERS/Damir Sagolj \nXi also said China would raise the foreign ownership limit in the automobile sector “as soon as possible” and push previously announced measures to open the financial sector. \n“This year, we will considerably reduce auto import tariffs, and at the same time reduce import tariffs on some other products,” Xi said at the Chinese Boao Forum for Asia in Hainan province. \nThe comments sent U.S. stock futures, the dollar and Asian shares higher.
