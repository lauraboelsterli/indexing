    "text": "(Refiles to correct media slug to CHINA HUARONG-PROBE)\nHONG KONG, April 18 (Reuters) - Trading in shares of China Huarong Asset Management Co Ltd and two of its units were suspended on Wednesday after Beijing said it was investigating the chairman of the country’s biggest manager of distressed assets for suspected graft.\nThe Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said late on Tuesday it was investigating Huarong Chairman Lai Xiaomin for suspected “serious discipline violations”, a euphemism for graft, making him the latest in a string of high-profile financial executives targeted.\nShares of China Huarong Asset Management, which has a market value of HK$124 billion ($15.8 billion), Huarong Investment Stock Corp Ltd and Huarong International Financial Holdings Ltd, were halted pending statements, the companies said in statements to the stock exchange.\nThey gave no further details. Huarong Asset Management declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. ($1 = 7.8499 Hong Kong dollars) (Reporting by Donny Kwok; Editing by Anne Marie Roantree and Himani Sarkar)\n ",
