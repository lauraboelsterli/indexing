Lirio’s hiring coincides with Vantis Life’s broader push into the direct-to-consumer market to complement its decades of success offering life insurance solutions through community banks, credit unions, and financial institutions.\n“Today’s consumers are interacting with businesses and making transactions online more comfortably and frequently than ever before. Gone are the days when corporate mailers and phone calls served as the primary avenues to market life insurance. In our digitized world, reaching consumers happens online more than anywhere else,” said Craig Simms, Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer at Vantis Life. “As we push into the direct-to-consumer market, Manny’s expertise leveraging digital marketing to explain the simplicity and affordability of life insurance products is a perfect fit for Vantis Life.”\nLirio joins Vantis Life with decades of experience expanding corporate brands online with SEO, messaging, and social media development strategies. He was previously part of a team that used these techniques to bring a professional liability startup to profitability in its first year of business. He has also served as the Director of Digital Marketing at The Hartford.\n“By building on their success in distributing policies through financial institutions, Vantis Life is primed for rapid growth in the direct-to-consumer market,” said Lirio. “By relaying to consumers the simplicity and affordability of life insurance with a digital marketing campaign that directly speaks to their unique needs and desires, we hope to place these important financial products into the hands of more Americans.”\nAbout Vantis Life\nEstablished in 1942, Vantis Life Insurance Company’s primary goal is to provide families affordable life insurance products. Vantis Life markets its products through financial institutions and direct to the consumer. The Company prides itself on providing simple, easy-to-afford products to middle-income American families and supporting these products with attentive and personal customer service.
