(NASDAQ:CWBR) (TSX-V:COB.U) (“CohBar” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce the closing of its second and final tranche of the previously announced private placement (the “Private Placement”) offering of non-convertible unsecured promissory notes (the “Notes”). The first tranche of the Private Placement was completed on March 29, 2018.\nPursuant to this second and final tranche of the Private Placement, the Company has issued Notes in the aggregate principal amount of US$1,760,000 and 352,000 warrants (the “Warrants”) to the subscribers of the Notes. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 8% per annum and mature on March 29, 2021. The Warrants are exercisable at a price of US$5.30 per common share until March 29, 2021; provided, however, that the expiry date may be accelerated in the event that some or all of the Notes are repaid prior to March 29, 2019. An insider of the Company participated in the second and final tranche of the Private Placement acquiring the principal amount of $40,000 in Notes and 8,000 Warrants. The aggregate gross proceeds of the Private Placement is approximately US$3,900,000 with insiders of the Company acquiring more than $500,000 principal amount of the Notes.
