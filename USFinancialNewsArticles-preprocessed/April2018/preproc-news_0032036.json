FILE PHOTO: Cars are parked at the Great Hall of the People during the opening session of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in Beijing, China October 18, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas Peter/File Photo \nChina will also scrap foreign ownership limits on new energy vehicle firms in 2018, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said in an online statement. \nThe rule change could provide beneficial for U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla ( TSLA.O ), which has been seeking to set up a wholly owned plant in Shanghai. \nChina will also scrap all foreign ownership limits in the ship and aircraft manufacturing industries in 2018, the NDRC added.
