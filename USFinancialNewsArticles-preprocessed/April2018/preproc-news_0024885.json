    "text": "(Reuters) - Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group ( 9984.T ) is part of a consortium of investors that are planning a $25 billion move to create international tournaments for soccer’s governing body FIFA, the Financial Times has reported.\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of SoftBank Group Corp is displayed at SoftBank World 2017 conference in Tokyo, Japan, July 20, 2017. REUTERS/Issei Kato/File Photo The report said the group, which includes investors from the United States, Saudi Arabia and China, were discussing proposals to expand the Club World Cup along with the creation of a new league competition for national teams.\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of FIFA is seen in front of its headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland September 26, 2017. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo The Club World Cup is an annual competition that sees seven clubs, usually winners of their continental tournaments, compete in a knock-out event. Spain’s Real Madrid have won three of the last four editions.\nThe report said FIFA would have a 51 percent stake in the venture.\nSoftBank declined to comment on the report.\nThe New York Times reported this week that FIFA President Gianni Infantino told his top board last month that a fund of investors from the Middle East and Asia wanted to pay about $25 billion to buy an expanded version of the Club World Cup as well as the rights to a proposed global league for national teams.\nReporting by Aditi Prakash in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Rutherford\n ",
