    "text": "VANCOUVER, April 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Mogo Finance Technology Inc. (TSX:MOGO)(OTCQX: MOGOF) (\"Mogo\" or the \"Company\"), which is focused on building Canada's leading digital banking experience, is pleased to announce that Mogo has received approval from the NASDAQ Capital Market (\"NASDAQ \") to list its common shares on the NASDAQ.\nMogo's common shares are expected to commence trading on the NASDAQ at the opening of trading on April 18, 2018, under the trading symbol \"MOGO\".\nGreg Feller, Mogo's President and Chief Financial Officer, commented: \"Listing on NASDAQ represents a significant milestone in the evolution of Mogo as we continue progressing towards our goal of becoming the \"go-to\" financial app for the next-generation of Canadians. We believe the listing will provide Mogo with increased visibility with prospective U.S. investors, improved liquidity and a more diversified shareholder base as we continue to grow our over 500,000 members and expand our suite of 6 innovative products, all available through our award winning mobile app.\"\nMogo also announces the filing of a preliminary short form base shelf prospectus (\"Prospectus\") in each of the provinces and territories of Canada, except Quebec, and a corresponding shelf registration statement on Form F-10 (\"Registration Statement\") with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") under the U.S.-Canada Multijurisdictional Disclosure System (\"MJDS\"). The Company has filed this Prospectus to maintain financial flexibility but has no immediate intentions to undertake an offering.\nThese filings, when made final and effective, will enable Mogo to make offerings of common shares and debt securities (collectively, the \"Securities\") of up to an aggregate initial offering price of C$50 million at any time during the 25-month period that the Prospectus remains effective (subject to MJDS eligibility).\nThe Registration Statement has been filed with the SEC, but is not yet effective. Securities may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time the Registration Statement becomes effective. Copies of the Prospectus and the Registration Statement are available at www.sedar.com and www.sec.gov , respectively.\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities, nor will there be any sale of the securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.\nIf any securities are offered under the Prospectus and Registration Statement, the terms of any such securities and the intended use of the net proceeds resulting from such offering would be established at the time of any offering, and would be described in a prospectus supplement filed with the applicable Canadian securities commissions and with the SEC at the time of such an offering.\nAbout Mogo\nMogo — a Vancouver-based financial technology company — is focused on building the leading digital financial platform in Canada and empowering consumers with simple solutions to help them improve their financial health. Built mobile first, users can sign up for a free MogoAccount in only three minutes and get access to 6 products including free credit score monitoring, identity fraud protection, the Mogo Platinum Prepaid Visa® Card, mortgages, personal loans and the MogoCrypto account which enables buying and selling of bitcoin.
