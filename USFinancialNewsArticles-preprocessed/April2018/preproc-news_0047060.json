Recent representations of note include former Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell, whose convictions were vacated by the Supreme Court; the deputy chief of staff to former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in her \"Bridgegate\" appeal; Mahmood Karzai, the brother of former President of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai, during a Southern District of New York grand jury investigation that concluded without charges being brought; and a former AOL vice president who was acquitted criminally and found not liable civilly in successive prosecutions brought by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
