Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm's site: http://www.bgandg.com/eric .\nThis class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nThe Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Ericsson prematurely recognized revenues and improperly delayed the recognition of costs related to services contracts; and (2) consequently, Ericsson materially overstated its revenues, margins, and profits during the Class Period.\nOn July 18, 2017, Ericsson disclosed that it would be terminating, renegotiating or revising 42 long-term service contracts with total annual sales of almost $1 billion. Following this news, Ericsson's American Depositary Share price fell $1.21, or 16.62%, to close at $6.07 on July 18, 2017.\nA class action lawsuit has already been filed.
