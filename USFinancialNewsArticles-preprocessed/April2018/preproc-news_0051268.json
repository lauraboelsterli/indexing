    "text": "Reports record first quarter revenue of $128.6 million Reports first quarter GAAP loss per share of $0.10 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.24\nPLEASANTON, Calif., April 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Natus Medical Incorporated (NASDAQ:BABY) today announced financial results for the three months and full year ended March 31, 2018.\nFor the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company reported revenue of $128.6 million, an increase of 3.1% compared to $124.7 million reported for the first quarter 2017. Revenue for the first quarter of 2017 included $9.0 million from our contract with the government of Venezuela which did not reoccur in 2018. GAAP gross profit margin was 55.7% vs. 53.5% in the first quarter 2017. GAAP net loss was $3.1 million, or $0.10 per share, compared with GAAP net income of $0.3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share in the first quarter 2017.\nNon-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.24 for the first quarter 2018, compared to $0.30 in the first quarter 2017. Non-GAAP net income was $8.0 million for the first quarter 2018 compared to the prior year's first quarter non-GAAP net income of $9.8 million. Non-GAAP gross profit margin was 59.0% vs. 57.8% reported for the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Company repurchased $4.7 million of its stock and repaid $25.0 million of outstanding debt during the first quarter of 2018.\n“I am very pleased with our first quarter revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share that came in at the high end of our guidance. We achieved organic revenue growth of 3% during the quarter, driven by revenue strength in our Otometrics business. Our Neuro and Newborn Care business units reported solid revenue and profitability during the quarter as well,” said Jim Hawkins, President and Chief Executive Officer of Natus.\n“As planned, we invested during the first quarter in Otoscan®, our breakthrough 3D digital ear scanning solution. Otoscan® was introduced last week at the American Academy of Audiology, the world's largest gathering of audiologists. We will continue this investment throughout 2018 and anticipate Otoscan® revenues in the second half of the year,” Hawkins continued.\nFinancial Guidance\nFor the second quarter of 2018, the Company provided revenue guidance of $129.0 million to $131.0 million and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance of $0.25 to $0.27.\nFor the full year 2018, the Company retained revenue guidance of $535.0 million to $540.0 million and non-GAAP earnings per share to $1.60 to $1.65.\nThe Company's non-GAAP earnings per share guidance excludes charges for amortization expense associated with intangible assets from prior acquisitions, certain other expenses, and related tax effects, which the Company expects to be approximately $8.4 million and $38.1 million for the second quarter 2018 and full year, respectively, and which the Company expects will reduce GAAP earnings per share by approximately $0.21 and $0.92 for the respective periods.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company presents in this release its non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per share, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margin results which exclude amortization expense associated with certain acquisition-related intangibles, restructuring charges, certain discrete items, direct costs of acquisitions, and the related tax effects. A reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP financial measures is included in this press release.\nThe Company believes that the presentation of results excluding these charges or gains provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the Company's core operating results and better reflects the ongoing economics of the Company's operations. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparison of operating results across reporting periods.\nSpecifically, the Company excludes the following charges, gains, and their related tax effects in the calculation of non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per share and non-GAAP operating expense and excludes all but restructuring charges from the calculation of non-GAAP gross margin: 1) Non-cash amortization expense associated with certain acquisition-related intangibles. The charges reflect an estimate of the cost of acquired intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. 2) Restructuring charges. The Company has over time completed multiple acquisitions of other companies and businesses. Following an acquisition the Company will, as it determines appropriate, initiate restructuring events to eliminate redundant costs. Restructuring expenses, which are excluded in the non-GAAP items, are exclusively related to permanent reductions in our workforce and redundant facility closures. 3) Certain discrete items. These items represent significant infrequent charges or gains that management believes should be viewed outside of normal operating results, and each significant discrete transaction is evaluated to determine whether it should be excluded from non-GAAP reporting. These items are specifically identified when they occur. 4) Direct costs of acquisitions. These are direct acquisition-related costs that occur when the Company makes an acquisition, such as professional fees, due diligence costs, and earn-out adjustments.\nThe Company applies GAAP methodologies in computing its non-GAAP tax provision by determining the annual expected effective tax rate after taking into account items excluded for non-GAAP financial reporting purposes. The Company’s non-GAAP tax expense and its non-GAAP effective tax rate are generally higher than its GAAP tax expense and GAAP effective tax rate because the income subject to taxes would be higher due to the effect of the expenses excluded from non-GAAP financial reporting. The nature of each quarterly discrete transaction will be evaluated to determine whether it should be excluded from non-GAAP reporting.\nThe Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the Company's performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods and the Company believes that investors also benefit from being able to refer to these non-GAAP financial measures along with the GAAP operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical performance. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated.\nConference Call\nNatus has scheduled an investment-community conference call to discuss this announcement beginning at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time (8:00 a.m. Pacific Time) today, April 25, 2018.
