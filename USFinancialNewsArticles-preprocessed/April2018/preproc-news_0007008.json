In 2016, the average debt in families in which the head of the household is age 75 or older was $36,757. That is up from $30,288 in 2010, according to a recent report by the non-profit Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington.\nHigh balances and calls from collection agencies can leave many older Americans feeling helpless.\nThe average monthly Social Security check is $1,404, and more than 40 percent of single adults receive more than 90 percent of their income from that check, according to the government.\n\"There's just fewer options that you have at that stage of the game,\" said Justin Halverson, a financial advisor and co-founder of Great Waters Financial in Minneapolis. \nBut the situation is far from hopeless. Here's what you can do. \n1) Get your budget in order  John Lamb | Photodisc | Getty Images Mapping your expenses will help you see where, and if, you have room to chip away at your debt, financial experts say. Doing so will also make it more likely that you stick to a budget, and therefore avoid falling deeper into debt. \nThe National Council on Aging offers the Economic Check Up , a website where users can obtain a free personal report on money management and budgeting. (There is also a job search at the site.)\nPlug in a few simple questions on the NCOA's Benefits Check Up page and the online tool will screen your eligibility for thousands of benefits for seniors, including meal deliveries and myriad potential tax savings, that could potentially help you to pull down your overhead. \nTo brace for coming health-care costs and possibly find ways to save on them, check out AARP's health-care cost calculator . For Medicare specific information, go to My Medicare Matters . \n2) Do what you can Daniel Grill | Getty Images As for that debt issue, Halverson recommends reaching out to collection agencies to find a way to negotiate more favorable terms. \n\"If you have debts with a hospital, I've heard stories where people have called in, told them their situation and the hospital was able to forgive some of the debt,\" Halverson said. \"Open communication is always going to be a good thing.\" \nSimilarly, if you foresee problems paying your mortgage, contact your financial institution as soon as possible, said Lori Trawinski, director of banking and finance at the AARP Public Policy Institute.\n\"If you wait until you're three or four months delinquent, it's much more difficult to get help,\" Trawinski said.",
