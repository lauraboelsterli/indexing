    "text": "LA PAZ, April 5 (Reuters) - Boliviaâ€™s consumer price index dipped 0.13 percent in March, driven by declines in clothing, food and transport prices, the official National Statistics Institute said on Thursday.\nThat brought the 12-month inflation rate to 2.73 percent. Prices had increased 0.32 percent in February and 0.3 percent in January.\nBolivia ended 2017 with 2.71 percent inflation, and the government expects 4.5 percent inflation in 2018.
