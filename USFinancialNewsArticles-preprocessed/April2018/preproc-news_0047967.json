View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180425006023/en/\nMoviePass Ventures acquires stake in Gotti Movie. (Photo: Business Wire)\nThe Gotti deal marks MoviePass Ventures’ second independent film rights deal, following its co-acquisition of the 2018 Sundance Film Festival fan favorite American Animals with The Orchard earlier this year. MoviePass Ventures allows MoviePass™ to further integrate its pioneering service with the movie industry and leverage its millions of subscribers to help create success for independent films in the theatrical window. By utilizing the MoviePass™ marketing platform to drive traffic to the theater, MoviePass Ventures hopes to capture additional revenue from downstream windows, including other forms of international, domestic, and streaming distribution in addition to merchandising, music and other ancillary rights.\n“Gotti is precisely the type of film we established MoviePass Ventures to support,” said Mitch Lowe, CEO of MoviePass. “We are helping boost traffic to these theaters for people to see these great films. This is an ambitious movie for which we’re thrilled to offer exclusive opportunities, such as exclusive tickets to the U.S. premiere event, word of mouth screenings and other Gotti related events, to our nationwide subscriber base.”\nDirected by Kevin Connolly and Produced by Randall Emmett (Lone Survivor, 2 Guns, Irishman (2020), George Furla, Mark Fiore, and Michael Frosch, Gotti stars John Travolta as John Gotti, Kelly Preston as Victoria Gotti, as well as Stacy Keach, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Spencer Lofranco, William DeMeo, Leo Rossi, and Victor Gojcaj.\n“Acquiring a stake in Gotti is exciting for MoviePass Ventures, because we’ve learned that a large impact in the box office equates to an even larger, positive impact on downstream revenue such as theatrical domestic and international distribution rights, streaming rights, DVD rights, transactional rights (Itunes), on-demand, and foreign movie rights,” said Ted Farnsworth, Chairman/CEO of Helios and Matheson. “Now MoviePass™ and MoviePass Ventures have the ability to participate in all of these potential revenue streams.”\nThe Gotti deal was led by Ted Farnsworth and Zac Bright on behalf of MoviePass Ventures along with Tom Ara of Greenberg Traurig, LLP and Randall Emmett and George Furla of Emmett/Furla/Oasis Films.\nAbout MoviePass\nMoviePass Inc. is a technology company dedicated to enhancing the exploration of cinema.
