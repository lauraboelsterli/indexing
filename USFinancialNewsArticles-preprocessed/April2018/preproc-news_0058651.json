    "text": "BATON ROUGE, La., April 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Investar Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:ISTR) (the “Company”), the holding company for Investar Bank (the “Bank”), today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. The Company reported net income of $2.4 million, or $0.25 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $2.3 million, or $0.25 per diluted common share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and $1.9 million, or $0.26 per diluted common share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The first quarter of 2018 includes acquisition expense of $1.1 million ($0.09 per share after-tax impact) and a $0.6 million ($0.07 per share impact) charge to income tax expense as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The fourth quarter of 2017 includes acquisition expense of $0.8 million ($0.06 per share after-tax impact) and a $0.3 million ($0.03 per share impact) charge to income tax expense as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, core earnings per diluted common share in the first quarter of 2018 were $0.40 compared to $0.34 for the fourth quarter of 2017 (refer to the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures table for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics).\nInvestar Holding Corporation President and Chief Executive Officer John D’Angelo said:\n“I am pleased to announce another successful quarter for Investar. Following the acquisition of BOJ Bancshares, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, The Highlands Bank, on December 1, 2017, our operating teams successfully completed the integration of The Highlands Bank in February 2018, while continuing to provide outstanding customer service. This is the first quarter of operations following the BOJ acquisition and, despite the acquisition-related costs recognized, our financial results reflect the positive effect of the acquisition on our balance sheet and income statement. We look forward to realizing additional benefits from the acquisition going into the next quarter.\nAs we look to 2018, we believe our company is solidly positioned to grow the franchise and increase shareholder value. We continue to focus on quality loans and deposits while controlling noninterest expense and maintaining our focus on improving our return on assets and efficiency ratios.”\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nTotal revenues, or interest and noninterest income, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 totaled $18.2 million, an increase of $1.3 million, or 7.8%, compared to December 31, 2017, and an increase of $6.3 million, or 52.4%, compared to March 31, 2017.\nTotal loans increased $14.2 million, or 1.1%, to $1.27 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $1.26 billion at December 31, 2017, and increased $370.8 million, or 41.1%, compared to $902.1 million at March 31, 2017.\nNoninterest-bearing deposits increased $5.3 million, or 2.4%, to $221.9 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $216.6 million at December 31, 2017, and increased $109.4 million, or 97.2%, compared to $112.5 million at March 31, 2017.\nNet interest margin increased fifteen basis points to 3.70% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to 3.55% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and increased forty-three basis points from 3.27% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nCost of deposits decreased one basis point to 0.91% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to 0.92% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and decreased six basis points compared to 0.97% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nThe Company completed the conversion of branch and operating systems associated with the BOJ Bancshares, Inc. acquisition during the quarter.\nThe Company repurchased 27,933 shares of its common stock through its stock repurchase program at an average price of $24.11 during the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nLoans\nTotal loans were $1.3 billion at March 31, 2018, an increase of $14.2 million, or 1.1%, compared to December 31, 2017, and an increase of $370.8 million, or 41.1%, compared to March 31, 2017.\nThe following table sets forth the composition of the Company’s loan portfolio as of the dates indicated (dollars in thousands).\nLinked Quarter\nChange Year/Year Change Percentage of Total\nLoans 3/31/2018 12/31/2017 3/31/2017 $ % $ % 3/31/2018 3/31/2017 Mortgage loans on real estate Construction and development $ 162,337 $ 157,667 $ 95,541 $ 4,670 3.0 % $ 66,796 69.9 % 12.8 % 10.6 % 1-4 Family 277,978 276,922 172,148 1,056 0.4 105,830 61.5 21.8 19.1 Multifamily 54,504 51,283 47,776 3,221 6.3 6,728 14.1 4.3 5.3 Farmland 20,725 23,838 7,994 (3,113 ) (13.1 ) 12,731 159.3 1.6 0.9 Commercial real estate Owner-occupied 274,216 272,433 181,590 1,783 0.7 92,626 51.0 21.5 20.1 Nonowner-occupied 279,939 264,931 210,874 15,008 5.7 69,065 32.8 22.0 23.4 Commercial and industrial 135,965 135,392 90,352 573 0.4 45,613 50.5 10.7 10.0 Consumer 67,286 76,313 95,873 (9,027 ) (11.8 ) (28,587 ) (29.8 ) 5.3 10.6 Total loans 1,272,950 1,258,779 902,148 14,171 1.1 % 370,802 41.1 % 100 % 100 % Construction and development loans were $162.3 million at March 31, 2018, an increase of $4.7 million, or 3.0%, compared to $157.7 million at December 31, 2017, and an increase of $66.8 million, or 69.9%, compared to $95.5 million at March 31, 2017. The increase in the construction and development portfolio at March 31, 2018 is primarily a result of organic growth in the Company’s Baton Rouge market where our lenders have great experience and long-standing relationships with local developers.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company’s total business lending portfolio, which consists of loans secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate properties and commercial and industrial loans, was $410.2 million, an increase of $2.4 million, or 0.6%, compared to the business lending portfolio of $407.8 million at December 31, 2017, and an increase of $138.2 million, or 50.8%, compared to the business lending portfolio of $271.9 million at March 31, 2017. The Company continues to focus on relationship banking and growing its commercial loan portfolio.\nConsumer loans, including indirect auto loans of $48.8 million, totaled $67.3 million at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $9.0 million, or 11.8%, compared to $76.3 million, including indirect auto loans of $55.9 million, at December 31, 2017, and a decrease of $28.6 million, or 29.8%, compared to $95.9 million, including indirect auto loans of $80.9 million, at March 31, 2017. The decrease in consumer loans is mainly attributable to the scheduled paydowns of this portfolio and is consistent with our business strategy.\nCredit Quality\nNonperforming loans were $5.5 million, or 0.44% of total loans, at March 31, 2018, an increase of $1.8 million compared to $3.7 million, or 0.29% of total loans, at December 31, 2017, and an increase of $3.4 million compared to $2.1 million, or 0.24% of total loans, at March 31, 2017. Included in nonperforming loans are loans acquired in 2017 with a balance of $3.0 million at March 31, 2018, which is the primary reason for the increase in nonperforming loans.\nThe allowance for loan losses was $8.1 million, or 146.78% and 0.64% of nonperforming and total loans, respectively, at March 31, 2018, compared to $7.9 million, or 214.43% and 0.63%, respectively, at December 31, 2017, and $7.2 million, or 337.95% and 0.80%, respectively, at March 31, 2017. As a result of the acquisitions of BOJ Bancshares, Inc. (“BOJ”) and Citizens Bancshares, Inc. (“Citizens”), the Company is holding acquired loans that are carried net of a fair value adjustment for credit and interest rate marks and are only included in the allowance calculation to the extent that the reserve requirement exceeds the remaining fair value adjustment.\nThe provision for loan losses was $0.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and $0.4 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017.\nDeposits\nTotal deposits at March 31, 2018 were $1.2 billion, an increase of $1.4 million, or 0.1%, compared to December 31, 2017, and an increase of $358.1 million, or 41.2%, compared to March 31, 2017. The Company acquired approximately $125.8 million and $212.2 million in deposits from the BOJ and Citizens acquisitions, respectively at the time of acquisition.\nThe following table sets forth the composition of the Company’s deposits as of the dates indicated (dollars in thousands).\nLinked Quarter\nChange Year/Year Change Percentage of\nTotal Deposits 3/31/2018 12/31/2017 3/31/2017 $ % $ % 3/31/2018 3/31/2017 Noninterest-bearing demand deposits $ 221,855 $ 216,599 $ 112,514 $ 5,256 2.4 % $ 109,341 97.2 % 18.1 % 13.0 % NOW accounts 228,269 208,683 168,860 19,586 9.4 59,409 35.2 18.6 19.4 Money market deposit accounts 145,627 146,140 124,604 (513 ) (0.4 ) 21,023 16.9 11.9 14.3 Savings accounts 124,589 117,372 52,682 7,217 6.1 71,907 136.5 10.1 6.1 Time deposits 506,332 536,443 409,894 (30,111 ) (5.6 ) 96,438 23.5 41.3 47.2 Total deposits $ 1,226,672 $ 1,225,237 $ 868,554 $ 1,435 0.1 % $ 358,118 41.2 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Net Interest Income\nNet interest income for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $13.9 million, an increase of $1.0 million, or 8.1%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, and an increase of $5.0 million, or 56.4%, compared to the first quarter of 2017. Included in net interest income for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 is $0.7 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of interest income accretion from the acquisition of loans. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by growth in loan and securities balances partially offset by an increase in interest expense as we funded the increase in earning assets with increased deposits and borrowings. Net interest income for the first quarter of 2018 increased $4.4 million and $1.7 million due to increases in the volume and yield, respectively, of interest-earning assets, offset slightly by decreases of $0.8 million and $0.3 million due to the increases in the volume and rate, respectively, of interest-bearing liabilities compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Company’s net interest margin was 3.70% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to 3.55% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and 3.27% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The yield on interest-earning assets was 4.59% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to 4.42% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and 4.10% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increase in net interest margin at March 31, 2018 compared to both December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017 was driven by an increase in interest-earning assets and the yields earned on those assets, and an increase in the volume of lower cost deposits, partially resulting from the acquisitions of both BOJ and Citizens.\nExclusive of the interest income accretion from the acquisition of loans, discussed above, as well as a $40,000 interest recovery in the quarter ended December 31, 2017, net interest margin was 3.52% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to 3.48% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and 3.25% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The yield on interest-earning assets was 4.41% at March 31, 2018 compared to 4.35% and 4.07% for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively.\nThe cost of deposits decreased one basis point to 0.91% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to 0.92% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and decreased six basis points compared to 0.97% at March 31, 2017. The decrease in the cost of deposits when compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2017 is a result of a decrease in the cost of interest-bearing demand and savings deposits. The overall costs of funds for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased three basis points to 1.10% compared to 1.07% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and increased twelve basis points compared to 0.98% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increase in the cost of funds at March 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017 is mainly a result of an increase in the cost of borrowed funds used to finance loan and investment activity. The increase in the cost of funds at March 31, 2018 compared to March 31, 2017 is mainly attributable to the increase in long term borrowings resulting from the Company’s issuance and sale, on March 24, 2017, of $18.6 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.00% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due in 2027.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $1.1 million, an increase of $0.1 million, or 11.4%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, and an increase of $0.2 million, or 21.1%, compared to the first quarter of 2017. The increase in noninterest income compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2017 is due to increases in service charges on deposit accounts and gain on sale of fixed assets. The increase in noninterest income compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2017 is mainly attributable to increased service charges on deposit accounts.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $10.6 million, an increase of $0.9 million, or 9.3%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, and an increase of $3.9 million, or 58.0%, compared to the first quarter of 2017. The increase in noninterest expense compared to the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017 is mainly attributable to the increases in both salaries and employee benefits and acquisition expense. The increase in salaries and employee benefits is mainly a result of the increase in employees following the BOJ and Citizens acquisitions, as well as the addition of four commercial lenders in the Baton Rouge, New Orleans and Lafayette markets, a Community Development Officer and Treasury Management Sales Officer in the New Orleans market, and a C&I Banking President, all occurring since the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increase in acquisition expense is a result of the BOJ acquisition that was completed on December 1, 2017 and the operational conversion which was completed in the first quarter of 2018.\nTaxes\nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $1.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, which equates to an effective tax rate of 35.8%, a decrease from the effective tax rate of 39.5% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and an increase from the effective tax rate of 31.2% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The income tax expense for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 include charges of $0.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively, as a result of the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities required following the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Company’s final analysis and write-down will be based on a number of factors, including completion of the Company’s 2017 consolidated tax return. Management expects the Company’s effective tax rate to approximate 20% for the remainder of 2018, mainly as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nBasic Earnings Per Share and Diluted Earnings Per Common Share\nThe Company reported both basic and diluted earnings per common share of $0.25 for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, a decrease of $0.01 compared to basic and diluted earnings per common share of $0.26 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in both basic and diluted earnings per share is attributable to the Company’s issuance of approximately 1.6 million common shares as part of a public offering on March 22, 2017, the issuance of approximately 0.8 million common shares as consideration in the acquisition of BOJ, the $1.1 million and $0.8 million in acquisition expense for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, and the $0.6 million and $0.3 million charges to income tax expense as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act recognized during the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nAbout Investar Holding Corporation\nInvestar Holding Corporation, headquartered in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, provides full banking services, excluding trust services, through its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Investar Bank, a state chartered bank. The Company’s primary market is South Louisiana and it currently operates 20 full service banking offices located throughout its market.

These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis measures and results, and the Company strongly encourages investors to review its consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.
