    "text": "TULSA, Okla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Alliance Resource Partners, L.P. (NASDAQ: ARLP) today reported financial and operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 (the \"2018 Quarter\"). Net income attributable to ARLP for the 2018 Quarter increased 48.6% to $155.9 million, or $1.16 per basic and diluted limited partner unit, compared to $104.9 million, or $1.10 per basic and diluted limited partner unit, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 (the \"2017 Quarter\"). The results in the 2018 Quarter included an $80 million gain on settlement of litigation. EBITDA also increased 28.7% in the 2018 Quarter to $228.7 million compared to $177.7 million in the 2017 Quarter. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the impact of the settlement gain, decreased to $148.7 million in the 2018 Quarter compared to $177.7 million for the 2017 Quarter. Delayed coal shipments due to weather-related transportation disruptions in the 2018 Quarter led total revenues lower to $457.1 million, slightly below total revenues in the 2017 Quarter. (For a definition of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and related reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures and actual and pro forma earnings per basic and diluted limited partner unit reflecting the exchange transaction announced in our July 28, 2017 press release as if it had occurred on January 1, 2017, please see the end of this release.)\nAs previously announced on April 27, 2018, the Board of Directors of ARLP’s general partner increased the cash distribution to unitholders for the 2018 Quarter to $0.515 per unit (an annualized rate of $2.06 per unit), payable on May 15, 2018 to all unitholders of record as of the close of trading on May 8, 2018. The announced distribution represents a 17.7% increase over the cash distribution of $0.4375 per unit for the 2017 Quarter and a 1.0% increase over the cash distribution of $0.51 per unit for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 (the \"Sequential Quarter\").\nIn addition, the Simplification Transactions announced by ARLP and Alliance Holdings GP, L.P. (\"AHGP\") continue to move forward. (See ARLP and AHGP Joint Press Release dated February 23, 2018). ARLP filed a preliminary registration statement on Form S-4 on March 29, 2018. On April 26, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission declared the Form S-4 effective to register the distribution of the ARLP common units currently held by AHGP and its subsidiaries to AHGP’s unitholders and, on April 27, 2018, AHGP mailed consent solicitation statements to its unitholders of record as of April 25, 2018. Consummation of the simplification transactions, which is expected to occur during the second quarter of 2018, remains subject to the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding AHGP common units. Certain AHGP unitholders, which collectively own a majority of the outstanding AHGP common units, have agreed to deliver a written consent approving the simplification transactions pursuant to a support agreement.\n\"ARLP’s financial and operating results for the 2018 Quarter were impacted by several factors,\" said Joseph W. Craft III, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"On a positive note, ARLP settled a coal sales contract dispute resulting in an $80.0 million gain. ARLP continued to be active in both the domestic and overseas coal markets during the quarter, increasing its sales commitments for 2018 to approximately 38.0 million tons, including export commitments of 7.1 million tons. To meet these new obligations we are planning to increase our production for the year by an additional 1.0 million tons to 40.5 million tons at the midpoint of our increased guidance, which would be 7.7% greater than last year.\"\nMr. Craft added, \"Even though weather-related transportation disruptions caused ARLP to ship 1.4 million fewer tons than expected this quarter, we plan to make up these sales later this year as river conditions return to normal. Based on these factors, as well as our favorable supply-demand outlook for the remainder of 2018, we are raising ARLP’s 2018 full year guidance. We remain committed to continue increasing quarterly cash distributions to our unitholders while maintaining a conservative balance sheet and strong distribution coverage.\"\nConsolidated Financial Results\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2017\nReduced coal sales volumes and prices resulted in lower coal sales revenues of $423.6 million in the 2018 Quarter compared to $438.7 million for the 2017 Quarter. Lower sales volumes in the 2018 Quarter reflect weather-related transportation disruptions, particularly at our Tunnel Ridge and Hamilton mines, partially offset by increased coal sales at our Warrior and River View mines compared to the 2017 Quarter. As anticipated, ARLP’s coal sales prices were also lower in the 2018 Quarter, decreasing 1.3% to $45.07 per ton sold, compared to $45.65 per ton sold in the 2017 Quarter. Coal production volumes increased 2.6% to 10.5 million tons in the 2018 Quarter compared to 10.2 million tons in the 2017 Quarter.\nCompared to the 2017 Quarter, operating expenses increased in the 2018 Quarter by 5.8% to $277.2 million resulting in higher Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton of $29.74 in the 2018 Quarter compared to $27.21 in the 2017 Quarter. These increases were primarily the result of decreased sales volumes at our Tunnel Ridge and Hamilton longwall operations due to the previously mentioned transportation disruptions at these operations, as well as reduced recoveries at several mines. (For a definition of Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton and related reconciliation to comparable GAAP financial measures, please see the end of this release.)\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization decreased $3.3 million to $61.8 million in the 2018 Quarter primarily due to the previously mentioned decrease in sales volumes at the Tunnel Ridge mine in the 2018 Quarter.\nOn March 9, 2018, ARLP finalized an agreement with a customer and certain of its affiliates to settle litigation we initiated in 2015. The agreement provided for a $93.0 million cash payment to ARLP, future conditional coal supply commitments, continued export trans-loading capacity for our Appalachian mines and the rights to acquire certain coal reserves near our Tunnel Ridge operation. A settlement gain of $80.0 million was recorded in the 2018 Quarter reflecting the cash payment received net of certain costs associated with the gain.\nCompared to the 2017 Quarter, contributions from investments in oil and gas minerals and gas compression services increased $3.8 million to $7.5 million in the 2018 Quarter, primarily due to distributions from ARLP’s preferred equity interest in gas compression services, which was entered into during the third quarter of 2017.\nRegional Results and Analysis\n% Change 2018 First 2017 First Quarter / 2017 Fourth % Change (in millions, except per ton data) Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Sequential Illinois Basin\nTons sold 7.008 6.665 5.1 % 7.391 (5.2 )% Coal sales price per ton (1) $ 39.39 $ 40.05 (1.6 )% $ 39.13 0.7 % Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton (2) $ 25.94 $ 24.22 7.1 % $ 24.93 4.1 % Segment Adjusted EBITDA (2) $ 94.8 $ 106.3 (10.8 )% $ 105.5 (10.1 )% Appalachia\nTons sold 2.390 2.930 (18.4 )% 2.712 (11.9 )% Coal sales price per ton (1) $ 60.79 $ 57.26 6.2 % $ 60.12 1.1 % Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton (2) $ 38.70 $ 32.53 19.0 % $ 40.39 (4.2 )% Segment Adjusted EBITDA (2) $ 53.6 $ 73.2 (26.8 )% $ 54.7 (2.0 )% Total (3)\nTons sold 9.398 9.610 (2.2 )% 10.103 (7.0 )% Coal sales price per ton (1) $ 45.07 $ 45.65 (1.3 )% $ 45.03 0.1 % Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton (2) $ 29.74 $ 27.21 9.3 % $ 29.48 0.9 % Segment Adjusted EBITDA (2) $ 165.3 $ 193.7 (14.7 )% $ 175.7 (5.9 )%\n(1) Sales price per ton is defined as total coal sales divided by total tons sold. (2) For definitions of Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton and Segment Adjusted EBITDA and related reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures, please see the end of this release. (3) Total reflects consolidated results, which include other and corporate and eliminations in addition to the Illinois Basin and Appalachia segments highlighted above. Weather-related transportation disruptions negatively affected sales volumes in both the Illinois Basin and Appalachia. While tons sold in the Illinois Basin were 5.1% higher compared to the 2017 Quarter as a result of increased sales volumes from our Warrior and River View mines, sales volumes decreased 5.2% compared to the Sequential Quarter primarily due to reduced shipments related to transportation disruptions at our River View and Hamilton mines. Coal sales volumes in Appalachia also declined 18.4% and 11.9% compared to the 2017 and Sequential Quarters, respectively, primarily due to transportation disruptions at our Tunnel Ridge mine.\nTransportation disruptions reduced our planned shipments in the 2018 Quarter, driving ARLP’s total coal inventory higher to 1.9 million tons, an increase of approximately 0.3 million tons and 1.1 million tons compared to the end of the 2017 and Sequential Quarters, respectively. ARLP currently expects to deliver these shipments to customers over the balance of 2018 as barge traffic normalizes.\nAs anticipated, ARLP’s coal sales price realizations decreased 1.3% per ton sold in the 2018 Quarter compared to the 2017 Quarter, primarily due to the expiration of higher-priced legacy contracts in the Illinois Basin offset in part by higher prices in Appalachia from improved price realizations at our MC Mining and Tunnel Ridge mines.\nTotal Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton increased by 9.3% compared to the 2017 Quarter as a result of higher expenses per ton in both the Illinois Basin and Appalachian regions. In the Illinois Basin, Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton increased 7.1% compared to the 2017 Quarter primarily due to lower recoveries at our Gibson South, River View and Dotiki mines and increased roof support and contract labor costs per ton across the region. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton in Appalachia increased 19.0% compared to the 2017 Quarter reflecting the previously discussed reduction in coal sales volumes, higher selling expenses and lower recoveries at our MC Mining and Tunnel Ridge mines, as well as an increased sales mix of higher-cost coal production from our MC Mining and Mettiki mines in the 2018 Quarter. Compared to the Sequential Quarter, Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton increased 4.1% in the Illinois Basin resulting primarily from reduced recoveries at our Hamilton and River View mines offset in part by a seasonal increase in unit shifts. In Appalachia, higher production volumes, due in part to a longwall move in the Sequential Quarter, and increased recoveries from our Tunnel Ridge mine drove Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton lower by 4.2% compared to the Sequential Quarter. For both segments, comparisons to the Sequential Quarter reflect reduced sales volumes from transportation disruptions and increased workers compensation expense due to annual actuarial reductions benefiting the Sequential Quarter.\nMarket Update and Outlook\n\"During the 2018 Quarter, ARLP reached agreement to deliver up to 19.7 million tons in 2018 through 2022, including an additional 4.8 million tons for delivery this year,\" said Mr. Craft. \"As expected, ARLP continued to increase its participation in the international coal markets having now booked commitments to export 6.8 million tons of thermal coal and 490,000 tons of metallurgical coal in 2018. Fundamentals in the international markets remain constructive for U.S. producers and should present ARLP with additional export opportunities through 2019. Domestic utility stockpiles in our markets are currently below five-year averages, which we believe will lead to increased buying activity for the balance of 2018. With these expectations supporting improved distributable cash flow and strong distribution coverage, our targeted distribution growth of 4.0% in 2018 remains intact. Longer term, we believe the strength of ARLP’s market presence, strategically-located, low-cost coal operations and increasing contributions from investments outside of coal should allow us to deliver strong results and value to our unitholders in the future.\"\nARLP has secured volume and price commitments for approximately 38.0 million tons in 2018 and for approximately 17.5 million tons, 11.7 million tons and 4.8 million tons in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively, some of which is subject to customer requirements.\nBased on results to date and expectations for the balance of the year, ARLP is increasing its guidance for 2018 full-year results to the following ranges: coal production of 40.0 million to 41.0 million tons, coal sales volumes of 40.3 million to 41.3 million tons, revenues (excluding transportation revenues) of $1.87 billion to $1.91 billion, net income of $405.0 million to $425.0 million and EBITDA of $710.0 million to $730.0 million. These 2018 estimates for net income and EBITDA include the settlement gain recorded in the 2018 Quarter and reflect an expected full year contribution of approximately $25.0 million to $35.0 million related to our investments in oil and gas minerals and gas compression services.\nARLP is also updating per ton estimates for 2018 compared to 2017. For the full-year 2018, excluding the settlement gain recorded in the 2018 Quarter, we currently anticipate coal sales price per ton to be slightly higher, Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton to be 1.0% to 2.0% higher and Segment Adjusted EBITDA per ton to be 3.0% to 4.0% lower, each compared to our full-year results in 2017.\nARLP is maintaining its previous 2018 guidance for capital expenditures in a range of $220.0 million to $240.0 million and investments related to the acquisition of oil and gas mineral interests of approximately $30.0 million.

Our method of computing EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, DCF and DCR may not be the same method used to compute similar measures reported by other companies, or EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, DCF and DCR may be computed differently by us in different contexts (i.e. public reporting versus computation under financing agreements).\nThree Months Ended Three Months Ended Year Ended March 31, December 31, December 31, 2018 2017 2017 2018E Midpoint Net income attributable to ARLP $ 155,908 $ 104,902 $ 74,235 $ 414,300 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 148 148 138 700 Net income 156,056 105,050 74,373 415,000 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 61,848 65,127 74,872 265,000 Interest expense, net 11,058 7,573 10,666 41,200 Capitalized interest (265 ) (81 ) (197 ) (1,200 ) Income tax expense (benefit) (10 ) (12 ) 213 — EBITDA 228,687 177,657 159,927 720,000 Settlement gain (80,000 ) — — (80,000 ) Adjusted EBITDA 148,687 177,657 159,927 640,000 Interest expense, net (11,058 ) (7,573 ) (10,666 ) (41,200 ) Income tax (expense) benefit 10 12 (213 ) — Estimated maintenance capital expenditures (1) (49,475 ) (43,427 ) (39,941 ) (191,300 ) Distributable Cash Flow $ 88,164 $ 126,669 $ 109,107 $ 407,500 Distributions paid to partners $ 68,396 $ 53,224 $ 67,528 $ 277,700 Distribution Coverage Ratio 1.29 2.38 1.62 1.47\n(1) Our maintenance capital expenditures, as defined under the terms of our partnership agreement, are those capital expenditures required to maintain, over the long-term, the operating capacity of our capital assets. We estimate maintenance capital expenditures on an annual basis based upon a five-year planning horizon. For the 2018 planning horizon, average annual estimated maintenance capital expenditures are assumed to be $4.72 per ton produced compared to the estimated $4.25 per ton produced in 2017. Our actual maintenance capital expenditures fluctuate depending on various factors, including maintenance schedules and timing of capital projects, among others. We annually disclose our actual maintenance capital expenditures in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC. Reconciliation of GAAP \"Operating Expenses\" to non-GAAP \"Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton\" and Reconciliation of non-GAAP \"Adjusted EBITDA\" to \"Segment Adjusted EBITDA\" and \"Segment Adjusted EBITDA per ton\" (in thousands, except per ton data).\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton includes operating expenses, coal purchases and other income divided by tons sold. Transportation expenses are excluded as these expenses are passed through to our customers and, consequently, we do not realize any margin on transportation revenues. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense is used as a supplemental financial measure by our management to assess the operating performance of our segments. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense is a key component of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in addition to coal sales and other sales and operating revenues. The exclusion of corporate general and administrative expenses from Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense allows management to focus solely on the evaluation of segment operating performance as it primarily relates to our operating expenses.\nThree Months Ended Three Months Ended March 31, December 31, 2018 2017 2017 Operating expense (1) $ 277,238 $ 262,027 $ 297,425 Outside coal purchases 1,374 — — Other expense (income) (1) 847 (533 ) 378 Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense $ 279,459 $ 261,494 $ 297,803 Divided by tons sold 9,398 9,610 10,103 Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton $ 29.74 $ 27.21 $ 29.48",
