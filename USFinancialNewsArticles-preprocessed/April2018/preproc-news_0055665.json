He understands the pivotal role physicians play in transforming healthcare in the United States. I am delighted we were able to bring Shawn into the Privia organization,\" said Doug Wenners, acting Chief Executive Officer of Privia Health. \"It has been a privilege to lead Privia for the last year, and I am excited to see Shawn continue our journey of 'changing health care to what it ought to be.'\"\nThroughout Morris' tenure at Cigna-HealthSpring, and its predecessor company, Morris was responsible for health plan operations, national contracting, mergers and acquisitions, innovation and strategy, new market development and government affairs.
