(NYSE:ITW) today reported first quarter 2018 GAAP earnings of $1.90 per share, a 23% increase compared to the year ago period. Revenue was up 8% with 3% organic growth.\nOperating income was $903 million in the quarter, an increase of 12 percent, and operating margin was 24.1 percent, an increase of 90 basis points. Enterprise Initiatives contributed 110 basis points of margin improvement, more than offsetting 50 basis points of unfavorable price/cost margin impact. While price/cost impact was dilutive to margin percentage, on a dollar basis pricing actions more than offset the impact of raw material cost inflation.\n“We are off to a solid start in 2018,” said E. Scott Santi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Despite lower than expected auto builds impacting our Automotive OEM segment, we delivered three percent organic revenue growth which, along with strong execution on our enterprise initiatives and disciplined price/cost management, resulted in operating earnings growth of 12 percent year on year for the quarter. As we look ahead at the balance of the year, the combination of ITW’s resilient high quality business portfolio, positive underlying demand trends, and additional benefits from enterprise initiatives have the company well positioned for continued top and bottom line growth. As a result, we are raising our full year EPS guidance by $0.15 at the mid-point.”\nAll seven of the company’s business segments delivered positive year on year organic growth, led by Welding (+8 percent), Test & Measurement and Electronics (+8 percent) and Construction Products (+3 percent).\nAfter-tax return on invested capital was 27.7 percent, an improvement of 400 basis points, of which 350 basis points is a result of the new U.S tax rules and regulations.\nIn the first quarter, Free Cash Flow was $444 million, an increase of 11 percent. The company repurchased $500 million of its own shares.\n2018 Guidance\nITW is raising its 2018 full-year guidance by $0.15 at the mid-point to a range of $7.60 to $7.80 per share, up from prior guidance of $7.45 to $7.65 per share, reflecting 17 percent EPS growth year on year at the midpoint. The company expects organic growth of three to four percent, operating margin in the range of 25 to 25.5 percent, free cash flow at or above 100 percent of net income, and an effective tax rate of approximately 25 percent for the year.\nFor the second quarter 2018, the company expects earnings to be in the range of $1.90 to $2.00 per share, up 15 percent at the mid-point, with organic growth of three to four percent.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThis earnings release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in the attached supplemental reconciliation schedule.\nForward-looking Statement\nThis earnings release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, without limitation, statements regarding diluted earnings per share, organic revenue growth, operating margin, free cash flow, effective tax rate, after-tax return on invested capital, timing and amount of share repurchases and expected dividend payout ratio.
