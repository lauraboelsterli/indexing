    "text": "April 18 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc has begun cutting jobs as part of its promise to investors to cut costs by $1 billion, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.\nThe size of job cuts is large enough that San Diego-based Qualcomm will have to file a WARN notice, or Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification, with the state of California, the report said.\nQualcomm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
