    "text": "0 COMMENTS Volkswagen AG’s VLKAY 0.61% Chief Financial Officer Frank Witter is expected to stay put in the event of a new chief executive appointment, people familiar with the situation and analysts said Tuesday.\nThe company’s supervisory board on Friday is set to vote to replace Chief Executive Matthias Müller with Herbert Diess, currently head of the Volkswagen passenger car brand and formerly development chief at German luxury car maker BMW AG BMW -0.13% , according to The Wall Street Journal .\n“Mr. Witter is seen as an anchor of stability at Volkswagen,” said Jürgen Pieper, senior advisor at B. Metzler seel. Sohn & Co. Holding AG, a German bank. “He is firmly in the saddle,” Mr. Pieper said.\nPeople familiar with the situation said Mr. Witter isn’t affected by the shake-up and will continue in his role as CFO.\nThe potential C-suite change comes as the German auto maker continues to navigate the costly aftermath of its diesel emissions scandal and the ongoing transition toward electric vehicles.\nMr. Witter took the CFO seat shortly after Volkswagen’s emission cheating became public in September 2015.\n‘It is a great honor and a great task to be CFO of Volkswagen Group but timing was really not great,” Mr. Witter said in a March interview with CFO Journal. The scandal “shook the company and its people,” he added.\nThe company said on Tuesday it is considering “further development of the management structure of the Group, which would also be associated with personnel changes in the Board of Management and with changes in the specific responsibilities of the Board of Management members.”\nA spokesman declined to comment whether the changes would impact Mr. Witter or his role as CFO.\nStill, a new chief executive often heralds other top management changes, particularly for the CFO seat. Roughly one in five -- 22% -- of new CFOs are appointed within a CEO’s first year on the job, and 41% of new CFOs are appointed within a CEO’s first three years on the job, according to data from Korn/Ferry International .\nMr. Witter will likely play a key role in the transition to a new leadership team, if one is announced, Mr. Pieper said. And while he is likely to keep his role, a new CEO could redefine Mr. Witter’s priorities or give him new tasks, he added.\nVolkswagen is battling problems on several fronts. The auto maker has spent over $25 billion on resolving the diesel issue, Mr. Witter said in March.\nVolkswagen is also wrangling with new competitors such as Uber Technologies Inc. and Tesla Inc., which are challenging established car brands. The car maker committed to invest €34 billion ($39.4 billion) by 2022 in the electrification and digitization of its business.\nThe broader car industry is scrambling to assess the potential fallout from the trade dispute between the U.S. and China and the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. An escalation of trade tensions would be a “ lose-lose situation ,” Mr. Witter said in March.\nMr. Witter joined Volkswagen in 1992 and held various executive roles, including a stint as CEO and CFO at Volkswagen America and Volkswagen Canada.\nWrite to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com and William Boston at william.boston@wsj.com",
