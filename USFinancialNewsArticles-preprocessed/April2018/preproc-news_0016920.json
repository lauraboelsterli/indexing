Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov shows the way to his North Korean counterpart Ri Yong Ho (L, front) during a meeting in Moscow, Russia April 10, 2018. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin \nLavrov told reporters he had accepted an invitation to visit Pyongyang, and that he and Ri had discussed the situation around North Korea’s nuclear and missile programme, and tensions between Pyongyang and Washington.

REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin \n“We welcome the gradual normalisation of the situation and the cessation of mutual threats, and the readiness for contacts between North Korea and the United States,” Lavrov said. \nRi did not appear before reporters after the talks, but told reporters beforehand: North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho (R, front) attends a meeting with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov (L) in Moscow, Russia April 10, 2018. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin \n“The current situation on the Korean peninsula and around your country, and the overall international political situation, require our two countries to further strengthen friendly cooperation, to increase our strategic communication and coordination of action between our countries.” \nRi said he hoped the two countries would find ways to create “a new milestone” in their relations this year. \nHigh-ranking North Korean officials have been engaged in a flurry of international diplomacy in recent weeks ahead of a possible meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. \nKim made a surprise visit to China last month for talks with President Xi Jinping, his first known trip outside the North since he assumed power in 2011. \nRi arrived in Moscow on Monday and held talks with Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev about the options for dialogue between Pyongyang and Seoul, the TASS news agency reported. \nLavrov said after meeting Ri on Tuesday that no decisions had been made on talks between Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
