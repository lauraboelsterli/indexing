REUTERS/Lucas Jackson The project was discussed again in Baghdad by Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi and a senior executive from Exxon Mobil in charge of extractive projects, Brad Carson, the ministry said in a statement.\nThe statement cited Carson as saying Exxon hopes to reach a final agreement over the project.\nThe “Integrated South Project” consists of building oilpipelines, storage facilities and a seawater supply project to inject water from the Gulf into the Luhais, Nassiriya,Tuba, Nahr Bin Umar and Artawi oilfields to boost oil recovery.\nReporting by Maher Chmaytelli; editing by Jason Neely\n ",
