    "text": "Maikel Franco had three hits and four RBI, Nick Pivetta pitched 5 2/3 scoreless innings and the Philadelphia Phillies won their home opener 5-0 over the Miami Marlins on Thursday at Citizens Bank Park.\nFranco was 3-for-4 with a single, triple and home run while Pivetta recorded nine strikeouts for his first win of the season as the Phillies were victorious after dropping four of their first five games on the road.\nOdubel Herrera also had a pair of hits for the Phillies, who received an early boost when Super Bowl-winning Philadelphia Eagles head coach Doug Pederson threw out the ceremonial first pitch.\nAdam Morgan, Luis Garcia and Hector Neris combined for 3 1/3 innings of scoreless relief to preserve the shutout and halt a maddening streak of six straight home-opening losses.\nThe Phillies drew nine walks in the win.\nThe Marlins came out flat as starting pitcher Caleb Smith lasted just three innings with six walks in taking the loss.\nMiami leadoff hitter Lewis Brinson struck out all four times.\nFranco gave the Phillies a 2-0 lead in the first with a two-run single to left. After Smith walked the bases loaded, Franco connected on a 2-2 slider and ripped it into left for the two-run advantage. Smith labored on the mound and threw 34 pitches in the first.\nIn the third, the Phillies went ahead 3-0 when Herrera singled to center, scoring Scott Kingery.\nSmith walked six batters through the first three innings, allowing the Phillies to jump out to a 3-0 lead.\nPivetta pitched out of trouble in the fourth, striking out Cameron Maybin with runners on second and third and two outs.\nPivetta was terrific in 5 2/3 innings, as he allowed only four hits while striking out nine and walking none.\nThe Marlins’ offense was relatively silent with just four hits through the first seven innings.\nFranco blasted a two-run home run to left in the seventh for a 5-0 Phillies’ lead. Franco’s homer landed 395 feet away from home plate against Jarlin Garcia for his third hit of the game.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
