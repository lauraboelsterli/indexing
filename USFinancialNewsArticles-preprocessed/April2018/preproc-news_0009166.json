    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin on Thursday said Facebook’s removal of accounts controlled by various Russian media was a hostile move that smacked of censorship.\nA figurine is seen in front of the Facebook logo in this illustration taken, March 20, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic Facebook said on Tuesday it had deleted hundreds of Russian accounts and pages associated with a “troll factory” indicted by U.S. prosecutors for fake activist and political posts in the 2016 U.S. election campaign.\nWhen asked about Facebook’s move, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Thursday agreed with a questioner from one of the affected media outlets that it was a hostile step which smacked of censorship.\n“Yes it is,” Peskov told a conference call with reporters. “We are of course following this and we regret it.”\nReporting by Andrew Osborn; Editing by Andrey Ostroukh\n ",
