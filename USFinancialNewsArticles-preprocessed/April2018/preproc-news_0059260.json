    "text": "BRASILIA, April 26 (Reuters) - Brazilian insurer SulAmérica SA has put its life insurance and private pensions businesses for sale as part of efforts to focus on core operations, newspaper Estado de S.Paulo said on Thursday.\nPotential buyers include AXA SA, Icatu Seguros SA, Allianz, Porto Seguro SA and the insurance unit of Banco Bradesco SA, the newspaper said, without saying how it obtained the information.\nSulAmérica had previously sold its corporate insurance operations to AXA in 2015, doubling down on health and auto insurance, which account for the bulk of its revenue.\nRepresentatives for SulAmérica and the companies mentioned in the article did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Estado cited a SulAmérica representative who declined to comment on market rumours. (Reporting by Bruno Federowski Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)\n ",
