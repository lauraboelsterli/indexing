    "text": "5 COMMENTS AT&T Inc. T -0.98% could raise around $653 million through an initial public offering of a minority stake in its Latin American business, Vrio Corp.\nAT&T said Thursday it expects shares in Vrio to price in a range of $19 to $22 and about 29.7 million shares in Vrio would be offered in an IPO.\nUnderwriters have an option to purchase roughly 4.5 million additional shares, which could raise an additional $98 million at the high-end of the marketed range.\nShares are expected to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol VRIO.\nVrio is a holding corporation for AT&Tâ€™s Latin American entertainment services including DirecTV Latin America and Sky Brasil.\nAT&T had spent months unsuccessfully searching for a buyer for the business, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year. AT&T in February filed documents to move forward with the IPO.\nProceeds from the Vrio offering will be used to pay down debt owed to AT&T and remaining proceeds will be distributed to AT&T.\nWrite to Cara Lombardo at cara.lombardo@wsj.com",
