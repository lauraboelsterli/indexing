    "text": "Ben Zobrist stroked a tie-breaking single in the 10th inning and Kris Bryant followed with a three-run double to lead the Chicago Cubs to a 10-6 win over the Miami Marlins on Saturday night at Marlins Park.\nIt was the second straight extra-inning game in this series.\nAside from Bryant, Chicago was led by Kyle Schwarber, who had a two-run homer, a double and two runs scored, and Anthony Rizzo, who also had two RBIs.\nMiami’s hitting standouts were Derek Dietrich, who hit a two-run homer, and Starlin Castro, who also had two RBIs.\nNeither starting pitcher earned a decision.\nYu Darvish, making his Cubs debut after signing a six-year, $126 million contract in the offseason, lasted just 4 1/3 innings, allowing five hits, two walks and five runs.\nMarlins starter Odrisamer Despaigne, who pitched in relief late Friday night and got the win in that 17-inning marathon, came back on just one night’s sleep. He lasted five innings on Saturday, allowing six hits, two walks and five runs, four earned.\nMiami scored twice in the first. Leadoff batter Lewis Brinson was hit by a pitch, and Dietrich followed with his two-run homer to the upper deck in right, belting a 1-2 slider.\nChicago tied the score 2-2 in the second, also doing damage with its first two batters. Willson Contreras hit a broken-bat single, and Schwarber lifted his two-run homer to the upper deck in right. He hammered a 3-1 cutter.\nEach team scored three runs in the fifth inning.\nRizzo, who grew up a half-hour from Marlins Park and went to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, came up with the bases loaded, two outs and a 2-2 score in the fifth. He then drilled a single into a shift, and it cleared the bases when right fielder Cameron Maybin bobbled the ball.\nMiami tied the score 5-5 on an RBI single by Brinson and a two-run single by Castro. Both of those hits came with two strikes, and Castro’s single gave him 499 career RBIs.\nChicago took a 6-5 lead in the sixth. Schwarber led off with a double, advanced on an Addison Russell single and scored on Jason Heyward’s sacrifice fly.\nBut Miami rallied again, tying the score in the eighth. Brian Anderson hit a one-out single, advanced on a Miguel Rojas infield single and scored on a Bryan Holaday single.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
