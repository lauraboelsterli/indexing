    "text": "PLAYA VISTA, Calif., April 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American Premium Water Corporation (OTC Pink:HIPH) (the “Company”) announces that its Gents subsidiary posted revenue of $169,313 in the fourth quarter of 2017, exceeding the 600-700% guidance provided last week, with a 150,000% increase in revenues over the same period last year (Q4 17’-Q4 16’). The Gents results will propel the Company to over a 400% year over year increase in top-line revenue. The 2017 year-end report will be released later this week.\nRyan Fishoff, CEO American Premium Water Corporation commented: “I am happy to report to our shareholders that Gents financial performance in Q4 beat even internal expectations. I was a bit conservative with guidance last week, but even I am blown away with the results. We had a good holiday selling season; same store sales were up compared to last year for our department store partners. We have seen progress from a number of initiatives we began in Q1 and I am optimistic that the momentum will continue through 2018. We will be releasing full year end results for the Company by end of the week and I am confident, with the addition of Gents, the Company guidance increases to roughly 400% year over year revenue growth from 2017.”\n“The Gents acquisition has already been successful for the Company. In addition to the revenue it has brought in, the Gents team has brought expertise in marketing and branding, as well as logistical & distribution support that will be utilized going forward as we ramp up the sales and distribution of LALPINA beverages. The intellectual capital acquired from Gents will be critical to for the Company to achieve its goals in the near and long term,” added Mr. Fishoff\nGents ( www.gentsco.com ) is sold in over 200 luxury retail outlets, including Bloomingdales, Saks Fifth Avenue, and Nordstroms. The brand, founded in 2012, focuses on men’s accessories, and has created a niche as being the first brand to focus on luxury baseball caps. The brand recently announced a joint venture with Zhangjiagang Advanced Company, a Chinese company that will begin distributing Gents products into mainland China. In addition to expanding geographically, Gents is looking to add product categories in 2018, leveraging its distribution network for accretive revenue.\n“Gents provides tremendous growth potential for the Company. It’s a great brand that has broad appeal. The Company is in a position to invest in the brand, and diversifying the product offerings is a key part of this strategy. There are 35 registered trademarks for Gents. I want to start leveraging them. Apparel is one area that we are going to aggressively pursue. Men’s grooming is another that I see lots of potential for. I’ve also had exploratory discussions with CBD producers about incorporating CBD into topical skin creams. From my research in the market, I have not seen any products like this in the men’s luxury marketplace, and this could be a real niche category for us. These are all things to consider as we evaluate how to invest the capital we are raising from the Reg A (Regulation 1/A) we recently submitted for review,” Mr. Fishoff commented.\nThe Company submitted a 1/A filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission for review on March 26 th . The Company is awaiting feedback and comments before the offering is effective, which at that point will determine the offering price and number of shares to be issued. The Company feels this structure will allow it to raise non-toxic capital and giving it the means to start the uplist process, which is a goal of the Company’s to be completed by the end of 2018.\nAmerican Premium Water Corp is the publicly holding trading company that owns LALPINA HYDROGEN, LALPINA HYDROGEN CBD & Gents.\nPlease follow us on our social media outlets listed below:\n@americanpremium\n@lalpinabrands\n@GentsCo\n#Gentsco\n#lalpinahydrogen\nFor more information on American Premium Water Corporation / HIPH, go to http://www.lalpinahydrogen.com/investor-page.html\nGents\nThe New York-based Gents is a producer of luxury hats and other fine accessories and apparel.
