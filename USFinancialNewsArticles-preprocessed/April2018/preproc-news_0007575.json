The flow of new truck drivers coming into the business is lagging far behind roaring U.S. freight demand, WSJ Logistics Report’s Jennifer Smith writes, and commercial-driving schools are seeing dimming interest from young recruits despite stepped-up efforts to lure new workers. With unemployment at a nearly two-decade low, the grueling downsides of life behind the wheel make recruitment tough, casting a grim demographic cloud over the business. The average age of a for-hire long-haul trucker rose from 42 years old in 2002 to 49 in 2014, according to the American Trucking Associations. Training schools can end up being costly for recruits, and that may have to change if companies want to build a pipeline of drivers that meets shipping demand.\nChina is firing back at the Trump administration’s latest trade penalties by setting far bigger targets for U.S. goods. Beijing says it will place 25% tariffs on some $50 billion worth of critical American exports, including soybeans, airplanes and autos. The WSJ’s Liyan Qi, Lingling Wei and Kenan Machado write the tariff rate and the sum of goods match an earlier White House proposal that would hit a broader range of goods, including dishwashers, medical equipment and machine tools. The new volleys sharply ramp up the severity of the trans-Pacific trade skirmish and heighten the stakes for both countries. The high-profile targets also raise the pressure on Beijing, leaving China few further options in a trade fight. The U.S. could take months to trigger its tariffs while China didn’t set timing on its retaliatory measures.\nMaritime’s global shipping regulator is facing a stormy path on the way to new emissions rules. The International Maritime Organization is kicking off high-stakes meetings in London with aims of setting world-wide standards to reduce the industry’s carbon emissions . The WSJ’s Costas Paris reports the IMO faces deep political divisions, with mainly developing countries arguing that strict emission standards will hurt their economies. The politically charged debate may not end at the IMO. Critics say the regulator has moved too slowly since shipping was excluded from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, leaving operators subject to varying rules around the world if different governments take action on their own. Vessel operators will have to comply with whatever final rules there are to stay in business, but the biggest challenge may be figuring out how to pay for the improvements as new standards come into force.\nSUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGIES Photo: Bloomberg News ﻿ Celadon Group Inc.’s soured bet on equipment leasing is coming back to haunt the trucker. The New York Stock Exchange is moving to delist the company’s stock, WSJ Logistics Report’s Jennifer Smith writes, after an internal investigation showed broader accounting problems than earlier reported at Celadon’s former leasing division . The ongoing problems are the result of ill-fated decisions earlier managers of the business made when they expanded rapidly into truck leasing during a previous hot market. That business floundered as shipping demand stalled out. Celadon’s new management team is talking with lenders as it rebuilds its finances and restructures operations to get slimmer. Celadon has slashed its fleet by 20% and sharply reduced the number of lanes it covers, and some data the company released suggests it’s getting help from a strong freight market. The actions are aimed at improving profitability—that is, once Celadon reports its earnings.\nTesla Inc.’s supply chain is accelerating but is still moving in a decidedly slow lane. The Silicon Valley auto maker showed progress toward building its new Model 3 sedan, the WSJ’s Tim Higgins reports, even though it missed a crucial production goal for building its first mass-market car. Tesla produced 2,020 Model 3 cars in the past seven days, missing its goal of making 2,500 vehicles a week by the end of March. Delaying that milestone adds more pressure for Tesla to meet its already-delayed target of building Model 3s at a rate of 5,000 a week by the end of June. The efforts have become a kind of test bed for whether an automotive supply chain can be built beyond the long-established factory networks of big car manufacturers. That leaves Tesla in a make-or-break period where it must prove it can handle mass production or face severe financial consequences.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ There are more leaving the industry than coming in. ’\n—Michael Gerdin, chief executive of truckload carrier Heartland Express Inc., on driver availability.\nNumber of the Day 7.5% Decline in flatbed truck capacity in U.S. spot trucking markets in the last week of March, as flatbed demand rose 7%, according to DAT Solutions LLC.\nIN OTHER NEWS Overall U.S. auto sales were strong in March as consumers moved toward bigger vehicles .
