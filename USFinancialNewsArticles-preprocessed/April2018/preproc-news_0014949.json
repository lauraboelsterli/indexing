    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - French pre-paid meal voucher and card provider company Edenred ( EDEN.PA ) has bought a stake in Candex, a U.S. start-up electronics payments firm, Edenred said on Thursday.\nEdenred said its investment formed part of a $3.5 million fundraising round for Candex, in order to finance Candex’s development.\nThe electronics payments industry has been steadily growing around the world, and recent deals in the sector have included Vantiv’s $10 billion takeover of Worldpay ( WP.N ) and Hellman & Friedman’s acquisition of Nets.\nIn February, Edenred handed investors a 37 percent dividend hike and delivered record 2017 earnings, and the company’s shares have hit all-time highs this year.\nReporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Leigh Thomas\n ",
