    "text": "GOLD COAST, Australia (Reuters) - Cate Campbell powered Australia to a world record in the women’s 4x100m freestyle relay at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games on Thursday, demonstrating that her year off to recover mentally from a disappointing Rio Olympics had worked wonders.\nSwimming - Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games - Women's 4 x 100m Freestyle Relay Final - Optus Aquatic Centre - Gold Coast, Australia - April 5, 2018. Gold medalists Shayna Jack, Bronte Campbell, Emma McKeon and Cate Campbell of Australia celebrate on the podium. REUTERS/David Gray Campbell anchored the Australian quartet, which also included her sister Bronte, Shayna Jack and Emma McKeon, to clock three minutes, 30.05 seconds and beat their previous record of 3:30.65 from the Rio Olympics.\nCanada finished second, with England third.\nIt was a satisfying return for Campbell, who had been a hot favorite to win gold in both the 50m and 100m freestyle at the Rio Games, but finished outside the medals in both.\nCalling her 100m freestyle loss “the greatest choke in Olympic history”, she stepped away from competition in 2017 to refresh and returned at the Australian nationals last month.\n“To come back from a year off and to be part of something where you’re the best in the world is a pretty special moment,” she told reporters.\n“I’m going to make sure I stop and take a couple of breaths to take in how special this moment is because not many people get to experience it.\n“This is the stuff of dreams and to have that in reality is something I’d never take for granted again.”\nSwimming - Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games - Women's 4 x 100m Freestyle Relay Final - Optus Aquatic Centre - Gold Coast, Australia - April 5, 2018. Gold medalists Shayna Jack, Bronte Campbell, Emma McKeon and Cate Campbell of Australia celebrate on the podium. REUTERS/David Gray The Australians, who had won the title at the last six Games, were facing arguably their biggest threat in a Commonwealth final since they were beaten by England at the Victoria Games in 1994.\nThe Canadians had a strong back end to their team with Olympic 100m champion Penny Oleksiak swimming the third leg before handing over to Taylor Ruck, fresh from winning the 200 freestyle gold.\nWhile Canada’s Alexia Zevnik had given her team a flying start, Bronte Campbell took over the race for the host nation and then McKeon, who had already swum two individual races, got them within sight of the world record as she destroyed Oleksiak by 1.34 seconds on the third leg.\nCate Campbell, whose tempo seemed to increase with the decibels as the 10,000-strong crowd willed her to the world record, then produced a flying final leg of 51.00 seconds.\n“It’s the first time I think I’ve heard the crowd while I’m swimming,” she added. “I could hear them roaring as I was coming down the last 25m.\n“I thought, ‘someone must be doing something special here’ and I thought we were being caught, but it was us breaking the world record.\n“I think that was really incredible.”\nReporting by Greg Stutchbury; Editing by Toby Davis\n ",
