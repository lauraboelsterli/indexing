    "text": "Tuesday night’s game between the Detroit Tigers and the host Pittsburgh Pirates was postponed by rain.\nIt will be made up as part of a single-admission doubleheader Wednesday. The opener will begin at 4:05 p.m. with the second game beginning 30 minutes after the conclusion of the first.\nThe Tigers and Pirates were rained out twice during their season-opening series in Detroit earlier in the season.\nThe Tigers will send right-hander Jordan Zimmermann (1-0, 7.71 ERA) and left-hander Matthew Boyd (0-1, 1.40) to the mound Wednesday. Pittsburgh will counter with right-handers Chad Kuhl (2-1, 4.57) and Jameson Taillon (2-1, 2.86).\n—Field Level Media\n ",
