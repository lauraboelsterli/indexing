    "text": "FREMONT, Calif., Lam Research Corp. (Nasdaq:LRCX) today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 25, 2018 (the “March 2018 quarter”).\nHighlights for the March 2018 quarter were as follows:\nShipments of $3.13 billion and revenue of $2.89 billion.\nU.S. GAAP gross margin of 46.0%, U.S. GAAP operating margin of 28.6%, and U.S. GAAP diluted EPS of $4.33.\nNon-GAAP gross margin of 46.8%, non-GAAP operating margin of 30.0%, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.79.\nKey Financial Data for the Quarters Ended March 25, 2018 and December 24, 2017 (in thousands, except per-share data, percentages, and basis points) U.S. GAAP March 2018 December 2017 Change Q/Q Shipments $ 3,134,677 $ 2,631,723 + 19% Revenue $ 2,892,115 $ 2,580,815 + 12% Gross margin as percentage of revenue 46.0 % 46.7 % - 70 bps Operating margin as percentage of revenue 28.6 % 28.6 % — Diluted EPS $ 4.33 $ (0.06 ) 7317% Non-GAAP March 2018 December 2017 Change Q/Q Shipments $ 3,134,677 $ 2,631,723 + 19% Revenue $ 2,892,115 $ 2,580,815 + 12% Gross margin as percentage of revenue 46.8 % 47.6 % - 80 bps Operating margin as percentage of revenue 30.0 % 30.2 % - 20 bps Diluted EPS $ 4.79 $ 4.34 + 10% U.S. GAAP Financial Results\nFor the March 2018 quarter, revenue was $2,892 million, gross margin was $1,331 million, or 46.0% of revenue, operating expenses were $503 million, operating margin was 28.6% of revenue, and net income was $779 million, or $4.33 per diluted share on a U.S. GAAP basis. This compares to revenue of $2,581 million, gross margin of $1,206 million, or 46.7% of revenue, operating expenses of $468 million, operating margin of 28.6% of revenue, and net loss of $(10) million, or $(0.06) per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 24, 2017 (the “December 2017 quarter”). The December 2017 results were negatively impacted by a one-time provisional charge of $757 million associated with the recently enacted U.S. tax reform, which the Company will continue to evaluate during the measurement period.\nNon-GAAP Financial Results\nFor the March 2018 quarter, non-GAAP gross margin was $1,353 million or 46.8% of revenue, non-GAAP operating expenses were $486 million, non-GAAP operating margin was 30.0% of revenue, and non-GAAP net income was $852 million, or $4.79 per diluted share. This compares to non-GAAP gross margin of $1,228 million or 47.6% of revenue, non-GAAP operating expenses of $449 million, non-GAAP operating margin of 30.2% of revenue, and non-GAAP net income of $788 million, or $4.34 per diluted share for the December 2017 quarter.\n“Lam continues to deliver strong performance, again setting new records highlighted by shipments exceeding three billion dollars in the March quarter. Fundamental to this achievement is increased strategic relevance enabling primary technology inflections now critical to our customers’ success,” said Martin Anstice, Lam Research’s Chief Executive Officer. “We remain focused on delivering long-term outperformance and making the right investments for our future.”\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow Results\nCash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments balances increased to $6.7 billion at the end of the March 2018 quarter compared to $6.0 billion at the end of the December 2017 quarter. This increase was primarily the result of approximately $1.1 billion of cash generated from operating activities, partially offset by approximately $80 million of net share settlement on employee stock-based compensation, $80 million of dividends paid to stockholders, $49 million of capital expenditures, and $29 million of net repayments of debt.\nDeferred revenue and deferred profit at the end of the March 2018 quarter remained steady at $1.1 billion and $749 million, respectively, as compared to the end of the December 2017 quarter. Lam’s deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to customers in Japan, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to customers in Japan are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance. The estimated future revenue from shipments to customers in Japan was approximately $526 million as of March 25, 2018 and $289 million as of December 24, 2017.\nGeographic Distribution\nThe geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the March 2018 quarter is shown in the following table:\nRegion Shipments Revenue Korea 36% 36% China 14% 17% Japan 20% 14% Taiwan 11% 12% Southeast Asia 8% 8% United States 6% 8% Europe 5% 5% Outlook\nFor the June 2018 quarter, Lam is providing the following guidance:\nU.S. GAAP Reconciling\nItems Non-GAAP Shipments $3.000 Billion +/- $150 Million — $3.000 Billion +/- $150 Million Revenue $3.100 Billion +/- $150 Million — $3.100 Billion +/- $150 Million Gross margin 46.8% +/- 1% $ 22 Million 47.5% +/- 1% Operating margin 29.7% +/- 1% $ 39 Million 31.0% +/- 1% Net income per diluted share $4.77 +/- $0.20 $ 36 Million $5.00 +/- $0.20 Diluted share count 179 Million 1 Million 178 Million The information provided above is only an estimate of what the Company believes is realizable as of the date of this release, and does not incorporate the potential impact of any business combinations, asset acquisitions, divestitures, balance sheet valuation adjustments, financing arrangements, other investments, measurement period adjustments associated with U.S. tax reform, or other significant transactions that may be completed after the date of this release. U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciling items provided include only those items that are known and can be estimated as of the date of this release. Actual results will vary from this model and the variations may be material. Reconciling items included above are as follows:\nGross margin - amortization related to intangible assets acquired through business combinations, $22 million. Operating margin - amortization related to intangible assets acquired through business combinations, $39 million. Earnings per share - amortization related to intangible assets acquired though business combinations, $39 million; amortization of note discounts, $2 million; and associated tax benefit for non-GAAP items ($5 million); totaling $36 million. Diluted share count - impact of a note hedge issued contemporaneously with the convertible notes due 2018, 1 million shares.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Results\nIn addition to U.S. GAAP results, this press release also contains non-GAAP financial results. The Company’s non-GAAP results for both the March 2018 and December 2017 quarters exclude amortization related to intangible assets acquired through business combinations, acquisition and integration costs associated with a business combination, amortization of note discounts, and tax benefit of non-GAAP items. Additionally, the March 2018 quarter non-GAAP results exclude realized loss on sale or impairment of investments associated with repatriation and tax benefit on the conclusion of tax matters related to a prior business combination. The December 2017 quarter non-GAAP results exclude costs associated with business process reengineering and estimated income tax expense associated with U.S. tax reform.\nManagement uses non-GAAP gross margin, operating expense, operating income, operating margin, net income, and net income per diluted share to evaluate the Company’s operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing investors’ ability to view the Company’s results from management’s perspective. Tables presenting reconciliations of non-GAAP results to U.S. GAAP results are included at the end of this press release and on the Company’s website at http://investor.lamresearch.com .\nCaution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nStatements made in this press release that are not of historical fact are forward-looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
