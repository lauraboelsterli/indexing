REUTERS/Alejandro Acosta \nTogether did not name the country or the local company with whom its subsidiary, Globus Pharma, signed the deal. \nThe first crops could be ready by the first quarter of 2019, the company said. \nUnder the deal, Globus Pharma will own 51 percent of the venture and the local partner will hold the remaining 49 percent. \nTogether said on Monday it had agreed to sell 5 tonnes of cannabis oil to an unnamed Canadian company that will potentially bring revenue of hundreds of millions of shekels.
