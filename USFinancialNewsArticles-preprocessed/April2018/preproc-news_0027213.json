    "text": "Published: Apr 14, 2018 9:47 a.m. ET Share \nLeague wants special investigator to review accusations of fraudulent claims potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars Getty Images The NFL has faced accusations that it has dragged its feet in paying players. The league argues that the long wait time for reviewing claims is the result of the growing need to closely evaluate all of the cases because of the crooked ones. \nBy Andrew Beaton \nThe National Football League has asked a federal judge to appoint a special investigator to probe what it describes as a widespread fraud that has resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in false claims to a fund meant to compensate former players for head injuries. \nThe motion alleges fraudulent schemes by doctors, lawyers and players to illicitly tap the uncapped fund, which is potentially valued around $1 billion. The league established the fund as part of a settlement agreement with players, and the NFL has so far funded more than $227 million in claims. \nThe motion—filed in the U.S. District Court for Eastern Pennsylvania, where the settlement is overseen—says that an independent administrator in the case has recommended that more than 400 claims be rejected because of fraud. That amounts to 23% of the total claims submitted and has a potential value of hundreds of millions of dollars based on the claims already awarded. \nAmong the allegations: At least one player was advised to show up to a neuropsychological evaluation hungover and on Valium, to ensure that he failed cognitive tests required to qualify for a settlement. Medical reports submitted by one neurologist included identical vital signs for more than 20 different players. One doctor claimed to have to have spent 130 hours evaluating players in a single day—on two separate occasions. \nThe 2017 concussion settlement between the league and retired players established a 65-year, uncapped fund for players with qualifying diagnoses, such as CTE, ALS, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s and other neurocognitive impairments.",
