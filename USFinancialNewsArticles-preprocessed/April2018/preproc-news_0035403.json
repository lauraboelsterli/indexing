The bank’s majority owner, the German state of Lower Saxony, has ruled out a complete sale.\nThe bank and its shareholders want to restructure the bank in way which avoids breaching European Union state aid rules, as this could force a complete sale of the bank.\nNordLB peer HSH Nordbank, once the world’s largest ship financier, was earlier this sold to buyout groups on EU demands year, after crippling writedowns and repeated state bailouts.\nBoth lenders have been dragged down by their exposure to the shipping industry, which has been going through its worst slump on record, although first signs of recovery have emerged in recent months.\nNordLB said it aims to post a net profit this year and to increase its capital ratio to 13 percent from 12.2 percent at the end of 2017.
