(TSX:CVE) (NYSE:CVE) today announced the appointment of Jonathan McKenzie as the company’s next Chief Financial Officer. He will replace Ivor Ruste who, as previously announced, will retire on April 30, 2018.\n“We’re pleased to have Jon join Cenovus. His broad experience in the energy industry will be an asset to the company as we continue to focus on strengthening our balance sheet and lowering our cost structure,” said Alex Pourbaix, Cenovus President & Chief Executive Officer. “I want to thank Ivor for his guidance and leadership in his role as Chief Financial Officer and for his significant contribution to establishing and building Cenovus. On behalf of the company, I wish him all the best in his retirement.”\nMcKenzie comes to Cenovus from Husky Energy Inc. where he has been Chief Financial Officer since 2015.
