We expect growth in the second half to be around 5-7 percent,” he said.\n“If trade tension between the U.S. and China intensify, though unlikely, it would further dampen the already weakening economy.”\nExport orders in Taiwan, a key player in the global technology supply chain, are seen as a leading indicator of actual shipments two to three months ahead and a gauge of demand for Asia’s high-tech gadgets.\nSLOWING MOMENTUM SEEN Orders from the United States, where Apple Inc is a major customer for major Taiwanese technology component makers, rose 6.5 percent in March from a year earlier and were up 5.2 percent for the January-March period.\nOrders from China, the island’s biggest trading partner, rose 6.8 percent last month and jumped 11.6 percent in the first quarter.\nMarch orders from the European Union climbed 1.9 percent and rose 6.4 percent from Japan.\nThe economics ministry expects export orders in April to fall between 9.2 percent and 11.5 percent from March to about $37.5 billion to $38.5 billion.\n“Looking forward, a slowdown in demand in mobile devices limits the growth momentum of communication products, but emerging applications such as high-performance computing, automobile electronics and artificial intelligence continue to expand, it could help orders for electronic products.”\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd , the world’s largest contract chipmaker, trimmed its full-year revenue target on Thursday on softer demand for smartphones, sending its shares and other Apple Inc supplier stocks tumbling on Friday.
