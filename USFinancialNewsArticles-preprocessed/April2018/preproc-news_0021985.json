    "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two men from the New York City borough of Queens were arrested on Thursday and charged with causing roughly $1.1 million of losses in a currency fraud targeting Korean-American investors.\nU.S. prosecutors accused Tae Hung “Kevin” Kang, 55, of Bayside, and John Won, 49, of Flushing, of “preying upon the kinship of their target group” by enticing victims to invest in or open accounts with their company, Forexnpower.\nProsecutors said the defendants overstated their trading expertise and falsely touted how their “Aset” and “Super Power-Bot” algorithmic trading methods would generate big returns.\nAccording to the indictment, some investors were enticed by ads in Korean-language newspapers offering “a secret trading method generating more than 10% monthly profit” and the chance “to make $1 million and more within three to five years.”\nInvestors allegedly lost more than $700,000 investing in Forexnpower, which was also known as Safety Capital Investment Inc, and nearly $400,000 in trading accounts, with some money misappropriated to attract new investors.\nThe schemes ran between 2010 and 2013, according to the indictment, filed with the federal court in Brooklyn.\nLawyers for the defendants could not immediately be reached for comment.\nBoth defendants were charged with securities fraud, and conspiracies to commit securities fraud, wire fraud and money laundering. Kang was also charged with wire fraud.\nThe wire fraud conspiracy charge carries a maximum 20-year prison term.\nIn 2015, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed related civil charges against both defendants. That case remains pending, court records show.\nThe cases are U.S. v. Kang et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 18-cr-00184; and CFTC v Kang et al in the same court, No. 15-05551.\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ",
