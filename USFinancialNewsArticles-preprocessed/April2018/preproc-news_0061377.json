    "text": "5 COMMENTS TIJUANA, Mexico—At 7 a.m. Monday morning, 19-year-old Olsin Ponce started packing up her belongings inside a makeshift migrant encampment here, preparing her two young children for the final walk to the U.S.\nDragging an overstuffed child’s-sized suitcase, with a comforter in one hand and her 8-month-old baby in the other, Ms. Ponce and her family began leaving the encampment of Central American migrants that had arrived at the border on Sunday afternoon .\nThe migrants had set up camp after being told by U.S. immigration officials that the port of entry was full and agents couldn’t process any more asylum-seeking migrants for the day. About 50 migrants from the caravan tried to cross the border Sunday evening, but were told to wait just outside the U.S. customs building.\nThe main group of migrants began their second day waiting at the crowded campsite, covered in blankets and tarps. At times, when someone seemed to have news of their fate, migrants rushed over with their bags, ready to start walking to the U.S., only to learn they’d still have to wait. Television crews moved through the campsite documenting the situation as it unfolded.\nMs. Ponce, who is from Honduras, and her children spent a chilly night in the plaza with the caravan, though they had made their way to Tijuana separately and said they weren’t part of the larger group.\n“Just me and my kids,” Ms. Ponce said as she ushered her 2-year-old son through the busy walkway that connects the Mexican side of the border crossing with the U.S.\nIt’s far from what certain what awaits Ms. Ponce on the Mexican side of the border crossing, where the roughly 50 Central Americans from the caravan spent the night stranded in the walkway just outside the U.S. border.\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said Sunday some migrants may need to wait in Mexico until immigration agents can process more asylum seekers.\nThe caravan started in southern Mexico and has gained international attention, and the ire of President Donald Trump . At it’s peak, the group was more than 1,000 people and organizers had expected as many as 300 migrants to ask for asylum in the U.S. The rest stayed in Mexico.\nBy Sunday, organizers said the group was down to about 180 people, about half of them children. Most remained in the plaza Monday morning.\nNicole Ramos, a San Diego immigration lawyer who has been helping the group in Tijuana, said that some of the remaining people decided to stay in Mexico after the U.S. asylum process and requirements were explained.\nFor those who forged ahead, Monday brought more waiting.\nRodulfo Figueroa, a Mexican customs official, told members of the caravan Monday that he sympathized with them but it was up the U.S. government to decide when and how many people could apply for asylum each day.\nThe U.S. statement from Mr. McAleenan didn’t say when officials expected to begin processing more asylum seekers or how many migrants the agency could handle at one time.\nAna Suaso, 37, said Monday the she understood the risks and that should could be separated from her children. Nonetheless, she and three sons spent the night in the plaza with dozens of others.\n“We don’t know anything yet,” Ms. Suaso said in Spanish, referring to whether she’d be allowed to apply for asylum Monday. “But I have faith in my heart that we will make it.”\nMs. Suaso said she and her boys hope to eventually make their way to New Orleans, where her mother is a legal resident.\n“She doesn’t know we are coming; I didn’t say anything” Ms. Suarso said. “I want to protect her.”\nWrite to Alicia A.
