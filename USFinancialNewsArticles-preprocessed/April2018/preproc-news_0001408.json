    "text": "April 3, 2018 / 6:50 PM / Updated 11 minutes ago New NY Fed chief will need to adapt fast to Wall Street role Ann Saphir , Jonathan Spicer 4 Min Read \nSAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - As New York Federal Reserve chief, John Williams will bring intellectual heft to the central bank as a permanent voting member of the rate-setting committee, although he will need to prove himself both as regulator of and chief communicator with investment banks like Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) and JPMorgan ( JPM.N ). FILE PHOTO: San Francisco Federal Reserve President John Williams speaks to Reuters in San Francisco, California, U.S. September 27, 2016. REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File Photo \nA top-notch economist who has done ground-breaking research on monetary policy as president of the San Francisco Fed, Williams will also have his work cut out in communicating with Wall Street as effectively as incumbent William Dudley has done. \nIt was Dudley who in February 2017 spelled out a “compelling” case for a rise in interest rates ahead of a rate-setting meeting and dragged market pricing into line with the Fed’s path on interest rates. \nWilliams will take over from Dudley when he retires in June. \nWilliams, who has spent 24 years working in the Federal Reserve system, will be responsible for managing the Fed’s financial market operations including more than $4 trillion in bonds it bought during the financial crisis and which it is now systematically trimming, hoping not to spook markets. \nOne focus of Williams’ academic research has been showing how low interest rates are here to stay, a key issue for the Federal Reserve and other central banks as they seek to hike policy rates from the zero lower bound. \nHis lack of links to Wall Street could prove to be an advantage. Under Dudley, formerly a managing director at Goldman and the bank’s chief economist, the New York Fed was criticized for its ties to investment banks it was charged with regulating. \nIt’s a plus to be “without deep ties” to Wall Street, said University of Oregon professor Tim Duy, adding that Williams is smart enough to “know his weak points” and tap the bank’s own staff for any expertise he lacks. WELLS FARGO AND LACK OF DIVERSITY \nWhile Williams may not conform to some of the stereotypes of a Federal Reserve president and academic economist - he is a “Trekkie,” plays first-person-shooter computer games, and sometimes wears red sneakers - he is still a middle-aged white man. \nThe search committee at the New York Fed had included a search for minority candidates in its mandate. Just two of the 12 regional Fed presidents are non-white, and two are women, while there is just one female Fed governor. \nThe post is not open to congressional review, although Williams has also faced criticism over San Francisco-based Wells Fargo ( WFC.N ), which opened millions of fraudulent customer accounts under his watch. \nWhile it is the Federal Reserve Board that makes calls on large bank supervision rather than individual regional Fed bank presidents, critics say the fact that he will now be regulating some of world’s most powerful financial institutions is a worry. \n“Mr. Williams’ track record raises several questions, including about his fitness to supervise Wall Street banks given the San Francisco Fed’s inadequate supervision of Wells Fargo during its many consumer scandals,” Senator Elizabeth Warren said last week. NOT A NEOPHYTE \nAlthough Williams has spent most of his career in the Fed system, he has had other work, with short stints on the Council of Economic Advisers, a semester or two teaching at Stanford and four post-college years managing Berkeley’s best-known pizza joint, Blondie’s. \nDespite the lack of experience dealing with Wall Street, Williams won’t be starting from scratch, says John Taylor, a Stanford professor who wrote a paper with Williams on a problematic jump in financial market spreads in early 2008. \n“He was one of the first people to notice problems in the balance sheets of financial institutions, way back before the financial crisis really took over,” Taylor said in an interview.
