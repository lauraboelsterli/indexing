    "text": "BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cabot Corporation (NYSE:CBT) today announced that Eduardo Cordeiro, executive vice president, chief financial officer (CFO) and president of the Americas Region , will retire from Cabot at the end of 2018. He will step down from these roles effective May 15, 2018 at which time Erica McLaughlin, the Company’s vice president of business operations for Cabot’s Reinforcement Materials segment and general manager of the tire business, will become senior vice president and CFO. Cordeiro will remain with Cabot in an advisory capacity through the end of the year to assist in a smooth transition.\nCordeiro, who joined Cabot in 1998, has been the Company’s chief financial officer since 2009. Prior to this role, he held a variety of senior finance and business leadership roles, including corporate controller, vice president of investor relations, as well as vice president and general manager of Cabot’s Fumed Metal Oxides and Supermetals businesses.\n“Over the past 20 years, Eddie has provided tremendous business leadership and financial stewardship.
