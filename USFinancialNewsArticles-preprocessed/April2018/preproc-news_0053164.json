He developed his football and the experience in Italy was very important for him.\n“Now I am sure he is a different player compared to the past and for that reason it is difficult to have this comparison with this player.”\nManchester United manager Mourinho said he was responsible for bringing the Egyptian to Chelsea in 2014 and defended his handling of the player when he arrived.\n“Everybody knows I bought Salah. I was at Chelsea, he was at Basel and I am responsible for the players I bring. I watch and I told the club to buy that fantastic young player,” he said.\nMourinho has been accused of not giving Salah a chance at a club where he made just a handfull of appearances in an unproductive 12 months during which the winger said he “didn’t talk much” to his manager.\nOn Friday Mourinho took responsibility for Salah’s lack of game time at Stamford Bridge but said he was provided with a pathway to develop.\n“He was not playing a lot and that is my responsibility as a coach and we decided with him it was better to have a loan period to play to grow up to become stronger,” said Mourinho.\n“Internally again with the board and technical director, we thought Italian football could be good for him to develop. He went to Fiorentina (on loan in Feb. 2015). After that I left and I am not responsible for the process.”\nSalah returned to Chelsea from Fiorentina before joining Roma on loan in August 2015. Salah then signed for them permanently in August 2016 — nine months after Mourinho left Stamford Bridge.\nHe was sold to Liverpool for 36.9 million pounds last June.\n“Credit to Mo, Juergen (Klopp), the team and I am very, very, very happy for him. He is a fantastic boy and he knows I have a great care for him,” said Mourinho. Reporting by Neil Robinson; Editing by Toby Davis",
