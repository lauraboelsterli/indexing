    "text": "NEW YORK, April 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Digital Remedy , a white-labeled ad operations and sales solution for publishers, advertisers and influencers, today announced the acquisition of CrowdHere , a curated collective of new media filmmakers and creative futurists. CrowdHere CEO Nick Pahade has been appointed as chief operating officer (COO) and president of Digital Remedy, a first for the company. Pahade—who has been on the Board of Digital Remedy for four years and has held various executive positions at Publicis, IPG, WPP and GSI Commerce—will report to CEO Mike Seiman and be based at Digital Remedy’s global headquarters in New York City. The CrowdHere team will be retained and operate as a flagship product under the Digital Remedy infrastructure. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n“As Digital Remedy continues our 18-year trajectory of growth and diversification, we must remember that the only constant in digital is change itself,” said Digital Remedy CEO Mike Seiman. “The addition of Nick to our executive team, with his experience and entrepreneurism, is a direct commitment to ensuring the continued growth of Digital Remedy.”\nAs part of Digital Remedy, CrowdHere can scale to support more advertisers with access to the company’s seasoned sales team coupled with its product and technical teams to amplify the reach of its finished projects.

CrowdHere will elevate the company’s ability to support publisher and advertiser goals of securing—and distributing—content that resonates across social as well as the over-the-top (OTT), connected TV (CTV) and on-demand (OD) landscapes.\n“CrowdHere’s successes point to the budding trend of video curation as a solution to overcoming the brand safety challenges that can be encountered with content marketing,” said Nick Pahade, COO and President of Digital Remedy. “Marrying our crowdsourced video content and group of thousands of global filmmakers with Digital Remedy will push content curation to the next level.”\nTo learn more, please visit: http://www.digitalremedy.com/crowdhere/ .\nAbout Digital Remedy\nDigital Remedy is the digital media solutions and technology company that delivers advertisers, publishers, and influencers the innovation, technology, and customer service they need to make the most of their online advertising endeavors.
