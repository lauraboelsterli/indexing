That’s almost 10 million barrels above the five-year average.\nU.S. crude production C-OUT-T-EIA rose by 46,000 barrels per day (bpd) on the previous week, to 10.59 bpd. That’s an increase of more than a quarter since mid-2016.\nAmerican crude oil output has overtaken that of top exporter Saudi Arabia. Only Russia currently produces more, at around 11 million bpd.\nWith U.S. output surging, some analysts warn that the 20-percent climb in Brent prices since February is starting to look overdone.\n“The market does look a little toppish,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.\nReporting by Henning Gloystein Editing by Joseph Radford\n ",
