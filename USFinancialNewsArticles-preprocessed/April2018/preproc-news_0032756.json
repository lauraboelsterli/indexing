    "text": "April 19, 2018 / 7:44 PM / Updated an hour ago New York's 'Fearless Girl' to stare down the Stock Exchange Peter Szekely 3 Min Read \nNEW YORK (Reuters) - The bronze statue of a little girl that became a tourism phenomenon by staring down Wall Street’s massive “Charging Bull” sculpture is to be moved to a nearby spot where its stern gaze will be on the male-dominated New York Stock Exchange, city officials said on Thursday. A girl poses with the 'Fearless Girl' statue on Broadway in the Financial District of Manhattan in New York City, U.S., April 19, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid \n“Fearless Girl,” whose message is for a bigger role for women in corporate America and whose appearance in lower Manhattan on the eve of International Women’s Day last year sparked a social media sensation, will be moved by the end of 2018, officials said. \n“She is a powerful symbol of the need for change at the highest levels of corporate America — and she will become a durable part of our city’s civic life,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement. \nAlthough the diminutive 50-inch (127-cm) statue was originally intended to be planted in front of the “Charging Bull” for only a week in March 2017, the city extended its stay by another 11 months after an outpouring of support.

It also opted not to use its equity clout last year in seven of eight shareholder resolutions to enhance boardroom diversity. \n“Fearless Girl” is not without detractors, including Arturo Di Modica, who objected to the placement in front of his “Charging Bull.” \nAlthough city officials said they are looking into moving “Charging Bull” as well, Di Modica’s lawyer, Norman Siegel, said the sculptor would need to give his permission, and has yet to be contacted about it.
