REUTERS/Denis Balibouse \n“The pressure on the Swiss franc is still there, the currency has devalued and the overvaluation has reduced, but the franc is still a safe haven,” she told an event in Zurich. \nSNB alternate governing board member Dewet Moser said the central bank stood ready to take action if the franc started to rise again. \n“We know from the experience of the past years that the \nmarket situation can suddenly change. The SNB... therefore must remain alert,” Moser said. “We analyse the events very closely and are ready to influence developments if necessary.” \nThe SNB has deployed negative interest rates and currency market interventions over the last three years to check the rise of the franc whose strength weighs on the export-reliant Swiss economy. \nThe strategy has begun to bear fruit, with the currency losing ground versus the euro this year.
