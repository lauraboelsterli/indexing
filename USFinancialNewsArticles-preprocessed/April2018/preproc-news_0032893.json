    "text": "April 18 (Reuters) - The following are the top stories on the business pages of British newspapers. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.\nThe Times\nRoyal Bank of Scotland Group has cleared a key hurdle towards its hopes of paying a dividend for the first time in 11 years by striking a 3.5 billion pound deal to fill the hole in its staff pension fund. bit.ly/2vqoXO6\nMarks & Spencer Group Plc is to shut a distribution centre near Warrington in Cheshire, placing 450 jobs at risk, as it seeks to revamp the way in which its products reach stores. bit.ly/2EVgEco\nThe Guardian\nWPP Plc has hired a New York-based recruitment firm Russell Reynolds as it begins the global search to replace founder and chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell. bit.ly/2ERoVhz\nAustralia has joined the U.S. and UK in publicly blaming Russia for a \"malicious\" global cyber-attack last year.
