    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - UK Asset Resolution, the British ‘bad bank’ set up to manage the assets of two failed lenders, has sold two portfolios of residential mortgages to an investor group led by Barclays ( BARC.L ), boosting the public purse by 5.3 billion pounds ($7.39 billion).\nThe sale of around 45,000 Bradford & Bingley and Mortgage Express housing loans is expected to complete within the next few weeks, the company said in a statement on Thursday.\nThe 5.3 billion pounds sum includes the final 4.7 billion pounds repayment of a 15.65 billion pounds Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) loan extended to Bradford & Bingley when it was nationalized in 2008.\n“This marks a significant moment in B&B&rsquo;s history with all 15.65 billion pounds returned to the FSCS and ultimately the taxpayer,” Ian Hares, Chief Executive Officer of UKAR said in a statement.\n“When complete, this sale will reduce UKAR’s balance sheet to 14.5 billion, an 87 percent reduction since its formation.”\nEquity funding for the acquisition was provided by Pimco, while a finance package in the form of a commitment to buy investment grade bonds has been structured by a consortium comprising Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, Nationwide, NatWest Bank and Santander UK.\n($1 = 0.7174 pounds)\nReporting By Sinead Cruise, editing by Carolyn Cohn\n ",
