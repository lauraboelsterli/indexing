    "text": "April 24, 2018 / 11:35 PM / Updated 4 hours ago U.S. Senate confirms new director for spy agency, cyber command Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate confirmed on Tuesday President Donald Trump’s choice to lead the U.S. Cyber Command and National Security Agency, Army Lieutenant General Paul Nakasone. FILE PHOTO - Lieutenant General Paul Nakasone, nominee to lead the National Security Agency and US Cyber Command, testifies before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., March 15, 2018. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein \nNakasone has an extensive background in cyber issues, having held positions including serving as chief of the U.S. Army’s cyber command since late 2016. \nNakasone, 54, replaces Admiral Mike Rogers, who is retiring after nearly four years in the “dual-hat” position leading the NSA, the country’s largest spy agency, and the military’s cyber warfare division. \nDuring his confirmation hearing, Nakasone said he did not think Russia, China and other countries had seen enough of a U.S. response to cyber attacks to change their behaviour. Slideshow (2 Images) \nHe also said he had not come to a decision on whether the NSA and Cyber Command should be separated. They have been combined since the cyber operation was created in 2009, but there has been debate recently over whether they would be more effective as separate entities. \nOpponents of the idea say it is essential that they work closely together against a growing threat. \nNakasone’s confirmation also means he becomes a four-star general.
