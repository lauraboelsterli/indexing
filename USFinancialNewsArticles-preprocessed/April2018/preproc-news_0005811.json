Was renamed as the British Empire and Commonwealth Games in 1952 with the 1954 event in Vancouver the first to use the title.\nThe last BE&C Games were held in Kingston in 1966, the first time they had been held outside of Britain, Australia, Canada or New Zealand.\nRenamed the Commonwealth Games for the 1978 Edmonton event.\nKuala Lumpur becomes the first Asian city to host the Games in 1998.\nQuestions raised over the future of the Games after the 2010 event in Delhi is blighted by construction delays, budget over-runs, poor living conditions at the athletes’ village, a number of high-profile withdrawals and low spectator numbers.\nOnly one city, South Africa’s Durban, bid for the 2022 event, with the bid rubber-stamped at Commonwealth Games Federation meeting in Auckland in 2015 giving Africa its first Games.\nThe coastal city, however, was stripped of the event last March after a failure to meet promises contained in its bid, with the 2022 event awarded to Birmingham.\nTHE GOLD COAST GAMES Bid was initiated by the Queensland state premier Anna Bligh in 2008.\nWas the only bidder until Sri Lankan city Hambantota entered the race in 2010.\nAwarded the 2018 event on Nov. 11, 2011, becoming the fifth Australian city to host the Commonwealth Games (Sydney, 1938; Perth, 1962; Brisbane, 1982; Melbourne 2006)\nMore than 80 percent of the venues had already been built prior to the bid being awarded.\nState and local government invested more than A$1 billion ($767.80 million) in upgrading the public transport system, with an extension to the light rail tram network connecting key venues.\nThe mascot Borobi is a blue koala with indigenous markings on its body. Borobi is an Aboriginal term for koala.\nBeach volleyball and women’s sevens are making their debut.\nCompiled by Greg Stutchbury; Editing by Amlan Chgakraborty\n ",
