FILE PHOTO: A car with the Volkswagen VW logo badge is seen on display at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., January 16, 2018. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo\nGroup earnings before interest and taxes declined 3.6 percent to 4.21 billion euros ($5.13 billion), VW said, below the 4.47 billion-euro consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of banks and brokerages. The new Volkswagen CC is displayed during a media preview of the Auto China 2018 motor show in Beijing, China April 25, 2018. REUTERS/Damir Sagolj\nWithout the accounting changes, operating profit came in slightly above last year’s level of 4.37 billion euros, VW said.\nThe carmaker stuck to its 2018 guidance published in February, predicting a return on sales of between 6.5 and 7.5 percent before special items, compared with 7.4 percent last year.\nRevenue is expected to exceed the 2017 record of 231 billion euros by as much as 5 percent while group deliveries may moderately exceed last year’s 10.7 million vehicles, VW said.\n($1 = 0.8207 euros)",
