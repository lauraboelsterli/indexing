    "text": "Humana is teaming up with two private-equity firms to buy privately held Curo Health Services for about $1.4 billion, the group's second such deal in five months that will create the largest hospice operator in the United States.\nThe consortium, which includes TPG Capital and Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, will merge Curo with the hospice business of Kindred Healthcare , which it agreed to buy in December for about $810 million.\nThis is the latest deal in a rapidly consolidating healthcare sector, with companies looking for new ways to bolster profits as the industry faces greater scrutiny for rising healthcare costs.\nReuters reported last month that Walmart was in early-stage talks with Humana for developing closer ties, with the acquisition of Humana being discussed as one possibility.\n\"We view the (Curo) acquisition as financially prudent for Humana but without a majority ownership position, achieving its operational goals could be more challenging,\" Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Steven Halper wrote in a note.\nThe deal indicates that Humana should not be viewed as a takeover target, Halper added, saying that a deeper relationship between Humana and Walmart is entirely possible.\nHumana's insurance business is focused on individuals in the U.S. government's Medicare program for the elderly and the disabled. The deals builds on Humana's focus on using healthcare providers in members' homes to improve patient care and save costs.\nSoaring healthcare costs have been a national issue, and the federal government has been restricting spending for healthcare, putting pressure on insurers.\nLast year, Aetna announced a $69 billion deal to be bought by CVS Health , fueling interest in how smaller rival Humana will compete.\nHumana will get a 40 percent interest in Curo and the deal is anticipated to close in summer.\nEvercore is the exclusive financial adviser to Humana. Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, and Manatt, Phelps & Phillips are legal advisers to Humana.\nDebevoise & Plimpton and Mintz Levin are legal advisers to TPG and WCAS. Ropes & Gray is also acting as legal adviser to WCAS.\nJefferies is the exclusive financial adviser and Kirkland & Ellis legal adviser to Curo.",
