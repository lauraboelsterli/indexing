    "text": "Botox maker Allergan reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Monday and raised its full-year forecast for adjusted net income, driven by higher sales of its medical aesthetics products including the blockbuster wrinkle treatment.\nThe company's shares rose about 2.4 percent to $166.70 in premarket trading.\nSales of Botox, its biggest drug by revenue that is also used in treating chronic migraine and overactive bladders, jumped 14.5 percent to $817.3 million in the first quarter.\nThe company's aesthetics unit, which also sells products to remove excess body fat, posted a near 30 percent jump in sales.\nThe Dublin, Ireland-based company has been conducting a strategic review of its business and considering acquisitions and divestitures.\nAllergan backed away from a bid for Shire Plc earlier this month, after confirming reports that it was mulling an offer for the rare-disease specialist.\nThe company managed to grow its revenue despite \"exclusivity challenges\" for older products, Chief Executive officer Brent Saunders said in a statement.\nU.S. Sales of Allergan's eye drug, Restatsis, which is expected to face competition from cheaper drugs, fell 17.2 percent.\nThe company now expects 2018 adjusted earnings of $15.65 to $16.25 per share, slightly above its previous forecast of $15.25 to $16 per share.\nNet loss attributable to shareholders was $332.5 million, or 99 cents per share, compared with $2.63 billion, or $7.86 per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding one-time items, Allergan reported a profit of $3.74 per share, topping analysts' expectations of $3.36, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nTotal revenue rose 2.8 percent to $3.67 billion, topping analysts' average estimate of $3.59 billion.\nCantor Fitzegerald analyst Louise Chen said a beat and raise was widely anticipated by the street since Allergan's setup looked \"conservative heading into the year.\"",
