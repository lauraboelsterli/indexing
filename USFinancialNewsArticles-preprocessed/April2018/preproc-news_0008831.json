    "text": "Hanley Ramirez delivered a walk-off RBI single to right field with one out in the 12th inning as the Boston Red Sox came back to beat the Tampa Bay Rays 3-2 in their home opener Thursday at Fenway Park.\nJackie Bradley Jr. doubled off Rays reliever Andrew Kittredge (0-2) to lead off the bottom of the 12th inning. Christian Vazquez’s sacrifice bunt moved Bradley to third and both Mookie Betts and Andrew Benintendi walked to set up Ramirez’s heroics.\nRamirez and Xander Bogaerts each drove in a run in the ninth for Boston, which won its sixth straight game after opening the season with a 6-4 loss at Tampa Bay. The Red Sox then won three in a row over the Rays to cap the season-opening series.\nMatt Duffy hit a two-run blast for his first homer of the season for Tampa Bay, which dropped its sixth straight after coming from four runs down to beat Boston in the opener. The Rays have been outscored 27-11 during their skid.\nBobby Poyner (1-0) pitched two scoreless innings of relief and struck out three to earn the win.\nTampa Bay starter Yonny Chirinos allowed three hits and struck out four in five scoreless innings while Boston starter David Price went seven scoreless with three hits, three walks and five strikeouts.\nAfter Mallex Smith walked to lead off the Rays’ eighth, Duffy sent a 1-1 pitch from Red Sox reliever Carson Smith into the center-field seats to make it 2-0.\nBut Tampa Bay closer Alex Colome squandered the save with a shaky ninth.\nRamirez ripped an RBI single to center to make it 2-1 after Betts led off the frame with a single to left and Benintendi walked. Bogaerts drove a ball off the wall in left-center to tie it two batters later.\nJackie Bradley Jr. was thrown out on a bang-bang play at first after grounding to second with two outs and the bases loaded. Boston challenged the call, but the ruling stood, sending the game to extra innings.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
