    "text": "\nShares of Spotify dropped on Wednesday, a day after debuting on public markets . \nThe stock opened at $140 — higher than its reference price of $132 set Monday — but lower than Tuesday's $149.01 close, amid declines in the broader market. \nBut even as markets recovered , Spotify closed 3 percent lower, at $144.22 a share. The stock price fell as low as $135.51 a share at one point in the day. \nSpotify's unusual public debut was seen as an initial success for the music streaming service, but could pose a challenge to Wall Street if the stock performs well.
