REUTERS/David Mercado/File Photo He also said that it was too early to talk about the format of cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC countries after 2018, and that cooperation may not necessarily be about extending output quotas, once the deal on oil production curbs expires by the end of this year, TASS reported.\nReporting by Maria Kiselyova and Vladimir Soldatkin; Editing by Jon Boyle\n ",
