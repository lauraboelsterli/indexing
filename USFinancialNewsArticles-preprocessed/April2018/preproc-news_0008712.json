    "text": "Achieves as-reported second quarter EPS of $3.27 and $3.22 in ongoing quarterly EPS First half as-reported EPS tracks ahead of the prior year from benefits of newest soybean technologies, lower taxes and improved glyphosate pricing INTACTA RR2 PRO TM soybeans reach 60 million acres in FY18, as expected Roundup Ready Xtend ® Crop System expected to reach nearly 50 million acres, with Roundup Ready 2 Xtend ® soybeans trending to 40 million acres and Bollgard ® II XtendFlex ® cotton to 8 million acres; initial estimates are for 60 million acres in FY19 Expects to hold genetic share for the full year in corn despite lower volumes and pricing in the quarter Gross profit in Agricultural Productivity segment up by more than 30 percent from improved glyphosate pricing\nST. LOUIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- At the halfway point of its fiscal year, Monsanto Company (NYSE: MON) today highlighted progress related to its FY18 business objectives, including the expected acres of INTACTA RR2 PRO TM soybeans in South America and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend ® soybeans in the U.S., coupled with the benefits from improved glyphosate pricing. The company also noted that results for its second quarter of fiscal year 2018 represented a solid performance, with as-reported earnings per share of $3.27 and $3.22 in ongoing earnings per share.\nWith Bayer leading the regulatory process for the pending merger, the companies continue to cooperate with regulators and have seen solid progress. The number of anti-trust approvals continues to increase, most notably from the European Commission, China and Brazil, and, as a part of this process, Bayer has announced several planned divestitures. With these actions, Monsanto continues to be confident in the companies’ collective ability to secure the required approvals within the second calendar quarter of 2018 and in the time contemplated by the agreement.\nSecond Quarter Six Months ($ in millions, except per share amounts) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net Sales by Segment Corn seed and traits $ 2,721 $ 2,902 $ 3,508 $ 3,851 Soybean seed and traits 912 862 1,640 1,462 Cotton seed and traits 123 108 243 224 Vegetable seeds 198 193 312 324 All other crops seeds and traits 134 121 155 173 TOTAL Seeds and Genomics $ 4,088 $ 4,186 $ 5,858 $ 6,034 Agricultural productivity $ 931 $ 888 $ 1,819 $ 1,690 TOTAL Agricultural Productivity $ 931 $ 888 $ 1,819 $ 1,690 TOTAL Net Sales $ 5,019 $ 5,074 $ 7,677 $ 7,724 Gross Profit $ 2,966 $ 2,952 $ 4,278 $ 4,211 Operating Expenses $ 1,070 $ 1,088 $ 2,140 $ 2,100 Interest Expense – Net $ 81 $ 84 $ 190 $ 202 Other (Income) Expense– Net $ (24 ) $ (88 ) $ (121 ) $ (45 ) Net Income Attributable to Monsanto Company $ 1,459 $ 1,368 $ 1,628 $ 1,397 Diluted Earnings per Share $ 3.27 $ 3.09 $ 3.65 $ 3.16 Items Affecting Comparability – EPS Impact (For definitions of adjustments to EPS, see note 1.)

We continue to pursue new innovations to benefit modern agriculture, as evidenced by several recent agreements, and we look forward to reaching additional milestones for the merger with Bayer.”\n“We met our acreage target for INTACTA RR2 PRO TM soybeans in South America, and the Roundup Ready Xtend ® Crop System is on a path to record trait adoption,” added Brett Begemann, president and chief operating officer for Monsanto. “In just the third year of the trait on the market, U.S. farmers are on the way to planting nearly 50 million acres of dicamba-tolerant soy and cotton in 2018, nearly doubling last season’s acreage. Based on anticipated market demand, we're expecting 60 million acres in 2019. Farmers clearly see the value in this weed control technology, and we are eager to partner with them to successfully use this vital tool.”\nResults of Operations\nNet sales for the company's fiscal year 2018 second quarter were essentially flat compared to the prior year's second quarter at approximately $5.0 billion. Gross profit totaled approximately $3.0 billion for the second quarter of fiscal years 2018 and 2017.\nThe second quarter results were driven by improved glyphosate pricing, as well as better pricing and increased acres from INTACTA RR2 PRO TM soybeans, offset by decreased corn volumes from the combination of timing and expected lower planted acres in the U.S., and from reduced corn prices from continued lower commodity prices in Brazil.\nSelling, general and administrative costs were $652 million, and research and development expenses were $394 million for the second quarter, basically flat, while other income declined by more than $60 million due to lower gains from asset sales and from currency and hedging related costs in the quarter. Finally, the effective tax rate declined to 21 percent, primarily from the lower U.S. corporate tax rate plus some discrete items.\nThe company’s fiscal year 2018 second quarter EPS on an as-reported basis was $3.27, compared to $3.09 in the prior year. EPS on an ongoing basis was $3.22, just above the prior year’s $3.19. The company is modestly ahead of the prior year at the first-half mark, with EPS for the first six months of fiscal year 2018 of $3.65 on an as-reported basis and $3.63 on an ongoing basis. (For a reconciliation of as-reported EPS to ongoing EPS, see note 1).\nCash Flow\nFor the first half of fiscal year 2018, cash flow from operations was a source of approximately $1.6 billion, compared to $1.5 billion the same period last year. Net cash required by investing activities for the first half of fiscal year 2018 was approximately $366 million, compared to $438 million for the same period of fiscal year 2017. Net cash required by financing activities for the first half of 2018 was $714 million, compared to net cash required of $494 million for the same period of fiscal year 2017.\nFinally, free cash flow was a source of $969 million for the first half of fiscal year 2018, compared to a source of $994 million for the first half of fiscal year 2017. The 2018 results were driven by the year-to-date improvement in net income, offset by the increase in capex as the company continues investing in its dicamba manufacturing plant, slated for completion in 2020. (NOTE: free cash flow is defined as operating cash flows less capital expenditures. For a reconciliation of free cash flow, see note 1.)\nOutlook\nFor the full year, the company continues to expect growth to be driven by pricing for glyphosate and the continued adoption of new technologies in Seeds and Genomics, such as INTACTA RR2 PRO TM soybeans, Roundup Ready 2 Xtend ® soybeans and Bollgard ® II XtendFlex ® cotton, as well as reductions in related launch costs for these products.\nThe company also remains diligent in its work to complete the restructuring and cost savings initiative that it began in fiscal year 2015. Selling, general and administrative costs and research and development expenses now are expected to be down slightly year over year.\nIn addition, the company expects that benefits related to strategic asset sales and licensing contributions should be about 30 percent below the roughly $350 million pre-tax average annual contribution for the last three years.\nOverall, with the solid start to the first half of the year and considering these factors, Monsanto continues to expect pre-tax income growth for fiscal year 2018, on a stand-alone basis.\nIncluding the effects of the recent U.S. tax reform legislation, the company expects the as-reported effective tax rate to be in the range of 23 to 25 percent, for the full fiscal year, as the Argentina valuation allowance is expected to increase during the second half of the year. For fiscal year 2019, the company is expecting an as-reported effective tax rate in the range of 24 to 28 percent, reflecting the new lower corporate tax rate in the U.S., the loss of the U.S. domestic manufacturing deduction, and a lack of some of the discrete benefits from this year.\nSeeds and Genomics Segment Detail\n($ in millions) Net Sales Gross Profit (A) Second Quarter Six Months Second Quarter Six Months Seeds and Genomics 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 Corn seed and traits $ 2,721 $ 2,902 $ 3,508 $ 3,851 $ 1,790 $ 1,932 $ 2,205 $ 2,467 Soybean seed and traits 912 862 1,640 1,462 672 628 1,260 1,079 Cotton seed and traits 123 108 243 224 101 77 174 150 Vegetable seeds 198 193 312 324 93 99 151 168 All other crops seeds and traits 134 121 155 173 81 41 79 53 TOTAL Seeds and Genomics $ 4,088 $ 4,186 $ 5,858 $ 6,034 $ 2,737 $ 2,777 $ 3,869 $ 3,917 (A) Fiscal second quarter 2017 seeds and genomics gross profit includes a pretax restructuring charge totaling $5 million related to certain asset impairment charges, primarily in the corn business, which is included in cost of goods sold. For the six months ended Feb. 28, 2018 and Feb. 28, 2017, seeds and genomics gross profit includes a pretax restructuring charge totaling $10 million and $6 million, respectively, related to certain asset impairment charges, primarily in the soy and corn business, respectively, which is included in cost of goods sold.\n($ in millions) Earnings Before Interest & Taxes (EBIT)\nSecond Quarter Six Months Seeds and Genomics 2018 2017 2018 2017 EBIT (For a reconciliation of EBIT, see note 1.)

Interest and taxes are recorded on a total company basis. We do not record these items at the segment level.\nThe Seeds and Genomics segment includes seeds, biotechnology trait products and digital agriculture products.\nSales for Monsanto's Seeds and Genomics segment in the second quarter were approximately $4.1 billion, down approximately two percent compared to the prior year period. Gross profit in the segment was $2.7 billion for the quarter, down approximately one percent when compared to the prior year. This reflects the balance of continued demand for new soybean and cotton technologies, juxtaposed with challenging commodity prices in markets where demand for grain continues to grow.\nFor soybeans, gross profit was up seven percent globally, at $672 million, despite an extremely competitive U.S. market. A key contributor was the ongoing demand for traits uniquely suited for South American geographies. The company reached its target of 60 million planted acres of INTACTA RR2 PRO TM soybeans in South America, where the team continued to deliver improved prices in local currency in the second quarter. In addition, the company recently received regulatory approval to plant the next-generation INTACTA 2 XTEND TM soybeans in Brazil and looks forward to a planned commercial launch in 2021.\nIn the U.S., the company continues to expect 40 million acres of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend ® soybeans to be planted in fiscal year 2018, which would be a record for new trait adoption in three years. In addition to the increased yields that growers have seen, the company remains dedicated to improving the grower experience. Ahead of the 2018 growing season, through the combined efforts of Monsanto, states and other industry participants, training has been conducted with more than 25,000 applicators to enable them to use dicamba to control weeds in the Roundup Ready ® Xtend Crop System. Earlier this year, Monsanto worked with The Climate Corporation to create and launch a free mobile app to help applicators plan successful XtendiMax herbicide applications. This digital tool provides location-specific weather forecasts, digital record-keeping capabilities and educational resources related to the Roundup Ready ® Xtend Crop System and has been one of the most widely downloaded apps in recent weeks, with high early user ratings.\nThe gross profit for Monsanto’s corn business was down seven percent, mostly due to volumes, which were down because of timing delays from the first half of the year to the second half, and from the expectation of lower planted corn acres. Confirming this timing shift, the company saw a nearly 40 percent increase in its U.S. branded corn seed shipments in March compared to the prior year. The company also saw a modest decline in corn pricing in the quarter, primarily as a result of the 30 percent decline in the corn commodity price in Brazil year over year. For the full year, the company now expects to hold genetic share globally, based on the performance of its portfolio, while it anticipates global germplasm pricing to be down modestly in local currency.\nIn complementary crops, Bollgard ® II XtendFlex ® cotton is now anticipated to be planted across eight million acres in the U.S., up from more than six million acres, as expectations for planted acres rise. This expansion helped contribute to a 31 percent boost in cotton gross profit for the second quarter.\nFollowing a brief commercial pause, the company is now moving forward with another season of Ground Breakers ® farm trials with NemaStrike TM technology in the U.S. With nearly 15 percent of global agricultural production lost to nematodes annually, there is clearly a need for the solution this product can deliver.\nThe Climate Corporation continued to see major advancements. In Europe, Climate is continuing its work following recent pre-launch announcements for the Climate FieldView TM platform for Germany, France and Ukraine. The team also completed its first season of beta testing in Argentina, complementing existing business in Brazil, Canada and the U.S.\nConnectivity is driving new opportunities for Climate, and the company signed seven new platform partners in the quarter, bringing the total to 25. For instance, in early February Climate and CNH Industrial announced a new partnership to deliver two-way data sharing to benefit customers of Case IH and New Holland Agriculture brands. Strategic discussions continue with dozens of other potential industry partners and collaborators to make it easier for farmers to share data with their agronomic partners for enhanced decision-making. Seamless data connectivity between Climate FieldView TM and other agriculture software systems is a crucial step in enabling farmers to gain customized field insights to help them get the most out of every acre.\nGlobally, expectations for paid acres on the Climate FieldView TM platform for fiscal year 2018 remain at more than 50 million, more than a 40 percent increase over fiscal year 2017.\nAgricultural Productivity Segment Detail\n($ in millions)\nNet Sales Gross Profit (A)\nSecond Quarter Six Months Second Quarter Six Months 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 Agricultural productivity $ 931 $ 888 $ 1,819 $ 1,690 $ 229 $ 175 $ 409 $ 294 TOTAL Agricultural Productivity $ 931 $ 888 $ 1,819 $ 1,690 $ 229 $ 175 $ 409 $ 294 (A) The three and six months ended Feb. 28, 2018 agricultural productivity gross profit includes a pretax restructuring charge totaling $4 million and $7 million, respectively, related to certain facility closures/exit costs and asset impairment charges, respectively, which is included in cost of goods sold.

Interest and taxes are recorded on a total company basis. We do not record these items at the segment level.\nThe Agricultural Productivity segment consists of the crop protection products and lawn-and-garden herbicide products.\nSales for Monsanto's Agricultural Productivity segment were $931 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. The company realized price increases over the prior year in the second quarter, as the generic pricing for glyphosate continued to improve, and reiterated the expectation that global average prices for the rest of the fiscal year should also be higher than the prior year.\nShifting to dicamba-based formulations, the company expects volumes of XtendiMax ® Herbicide with VaporGrip ® Technology to grow with expanding acres of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend ® soybeans and Bollgard ® II XtendFlex ® cotton acres, albeit in a very competitive over-the-top formulation market.\nFor more information on these results, please visit www.monsanto.com/investors/reports for presentation slides related to the second quarter.\nAbout Monsanto Company\nMonsanto is committed to bringing a broad range of solutions to help nourish our growing world.

This press release uses the non-GAAP financial measures of gross profit, operating expenses, net income (loss) attributable to Monsanto Company and diluted earnings per share (EPS), each on an ongoing basis (collectively, “Ongoing Financial Measures”), and EBIT and free cash flow. The Ongoing Financial Measures and EBIT are intended to supplement investor's understanding of our operating performance. The free cash flow measure is intended to supplement investor's understanding of our liquidity. They are different from and not intended to replace gross profit, operating expenses, net income (loss) attributable to Monsanto Company, diluted EPS, cash flows, financial position or comprehensive income (loss), and they are not measures of financial performance as determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.\nOur Ongoing Financial Measures exclude certain items that we do not consider part of ongoing operations. We believe that our Ongoing Financial Measures presented with these adjustments are useful to investors as they best reflect our ongoing performance and business operations during the periods presented and are also useful to investors for comparative purposes. In addition, management uses the Ongoing Financial Measures as a guide in its budgeting and long-range planning processes, and the ongoing EPS financial measure is used as a guide in determining incentive compensation.\nEBIT is defined as earnings (loss) before interest and taxes. Earnings (loss) is intended to mean net income (loss) attributable to Monsanto Company as presented in the Statements of Consolidated Operations under GAAP. EBIT is an operating performance measure for our two business segments. We believe that EBIT is useful to investors and management to demonstrate the operational profitability of our segments by excluding interest and taxes, which are generally accounted for across the entire company on a consolidated basis. EBIT is also one of the measures used by management to determine resource allocations within the company.\nWe define free cash flow as the total of net cash provided or required by operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. We believe that free cash flow is an important liquidity measure for the company and that it is useful to investors and management as a measure of the ability of our business to generate cash. Once business needs and obligations are met, this cash can be used to reinvest in the company for future growth or to return to our shareowners through dividend payments or share repurchases. Free cash flow is also used as one of the performance measures in determining incentive compensation.\nThe following tables reconcile GAAP as-reported financial measures to Non-GAAP financial measures.\nReconciliation of GAAP As-Reported to Selected Non-GAAP Financial Measures:\nThree Months Ended Feb. 28, 2018 (in millions) GAAP As Reported Adjustments (A) Ongoing Basis Net Sales $ 5,019 $ — $ 5,019 Gross Profit 2,966 4 2,970 Operating Expenses (B) 1,070 (35 ) 1,035 Net Income Attributable to Monsanto Company 1,459 (25 ) 1,434 Diluted Earnings per Share 3.27 (0.05 ) 3.22 Six Months Ended Feb. 28, 2018 (in millions) GAAP As Reported Adjustments (A) Ongoing Basis Net Sales $ 7,677 $ — $ 7,677 Gross Profit 4,278 17 4,295 Operating Expenses (B) 2,140 (75 ) 2,065 Net Income Attributable to Monsanto Company 1,628 (11 ) 1,617 Diluted Earnings per Share 3.65 (0.02 ) 3.63 (A) In the three and six months ended Feb. 28, 2018, select GAAP measures have been adjusted to an ongoing basis by eliminating the impact of restructuring charges, environmental and litigation matters, pending Bayer transaction related costs, Argentine-related tax matters, impact of income tax legislation and income from discontinued operations.
