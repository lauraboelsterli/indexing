    "text": "Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard after two years to launch Microsoft, which he helped turn into a multibillion-dollar tech company .\nHe became a millionaire at the ripe age of 26, thanks to Microsoft's IPO, and today he's one of the world's richest people, with an estimated net worth of $90 billion .\nDuring a Q&A with Harvard students last week, the entrepreneur shared a key to success: \"The thing that you're likely to be world-class at is whatever you obsessed over from age 12 to 18. In my case, it was writing software.\"\nshow chapters Bill Gates: These skills will be most in-demand in the job market of the future 8:26 AM ET Tue, 13 March 2018 | 01:10 Gates has been fixated on tech since age 13, when he was a student at Lakeside School in Seattle, Washington. As Gates recalled in a 2005 speech , the school's \"mothers club came up with the money to buy a teletype that connected over the phone lines with a GE time-sharing computer,\" and that machine effectively changed his life. He spent as much time as he could learning about computers, hacking and coding.\nThere's something to be said for chasing a dream. Some of the most successful people are fueled by their enthusiasm for what they're doing , including Gates' longtime friend Warren Buffett. \"Being successful at almost anything means having a passion for it,\" says the Oracle of Omaha . \"If you see somebody with even reasonable intelligence and a terrific passion for what they do, ... things are gonna happen.\"\nBuffett's right-hand man Charlie Munger has a similar perspective. \"I have never succeeded very much in anything in which I was not very interested,\" he says . \"If you can't somehow find yourself very interested in something, I don't think you'll succeed very much, even if you're fairly smart.\"\nNot every successful person says to find a career path that piques your natural interest. Self-made billionaire and \"Shark Tank\" star Mark Cuban, for example, says that following your passion is \" one of the great lies of life .\"\nBut for Gates, Buffett and others , that career advice has worked wonders.\nLike this story?
