    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€” The Latest on Spotify's Wall Street debut (all times local):\n11:20 a.m.\nThe market is still awaiting Spotify's highly anticipated public debut as the streaming music service goes through with its unusual \"direct listing\".\nThe NYSE had set a reference price of $132 for the stock, though the actual price will be determined by shareholders. The Swedish company's use of a \"direct listing\" allows its early investors and employees to sell as many shares as they want whenever they want.\nThe company has traded between $48.93 and $132 over the last 12 months through private transactions, and indications Tuesday showed it could trade as high as $155.\nThe company, with more than 71 million subscribers, is not raising any money through the IPO.",
