    "text": "Arizona teachers voted late Thursday to go on strike next week, making the state the fourth this year to host teacher protests in support of increased pay.\nThe stateâ€™s union, and organizers of a Facebook group where rank-and-file teachers have been posting, announced the results of a vote at a joint press conference in Phoenix. Seventy-eight percent of teachers who cast ballots supported the protest, they said, and the walkout is set to begin next Thursday.\n ",
