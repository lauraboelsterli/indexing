    "text": "16 COMMENTS Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has been admitted to a hospital for diverticulitis for the second time in recent days, but he remains in contact with his department’s leadership and the White House, according to a statement released Wednesday.\nMr. Azar was first hospitalized Sunday night following a “minor infection” for observation and intravenous antibiotics “out of an abundance of caution,” HHS said Sunday. He was discharged Monday from St. Vincent hospital in Indianapolis.\n“I’m grateful for the incredible doctors & nurses who provided me with excellent care during my one-night stay at @StVincentIN,” Mr. Azar tweeted Monday. “Also thankful for my wife, who insisted that I call my primary care doctor when I wasn’t feeling well. Glad to be back at work for the American people.”\nOn Wednesday, the department said he was readmitted for additional treatment and observation on the recommendation of his doctor.\n“Secretary Azar has been and will continue to be in regular contact with HHS leadership, the White House, and members of Congress as he remains fully engaged with the responsibilities of his job,” according to a statement.\nDiverticulitis occurs when pouches in the wall of the colon become inflamed or infected and can be very painful. Complicated cases may require surgery.\nWrite to Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.com",
