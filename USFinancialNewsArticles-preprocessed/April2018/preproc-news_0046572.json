(the “Company”) (Nasdaq:LECO) today reported first quarter 2018 net income of $60.8 million, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.92. This compares with $55.8 million, or $0.84 EPS in the prior year period. Reported EPS includes special item after-tax charges of $12.5 million, or $0.18 EPS. Excluding these items, first quarter 2018 adjusted net income increased 25.1% to $73.3 million, or $1.10 EPS, as compared with $58.6 million, or $0.88 EPS in the prior year period. The first quarter 2018 effective tax rate was 27.8% due to special items. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 24.5%, which compares to 28.1% in the comparable 2017 period.\nFirst quarter 2018 sales increased 30.4% to $757.7 million from an 18.3% benefit from acquisitions, 5.2% higher volumes, a 4.2% increase in price and 2.7% from favorable foreign exchange.\nOperating income for the first quarter 2018 was $85.2 million, or 11.2% of sales. This compares with operating income of $79.4 million, or 13.7% of sales, in the comparable 2017 period. On an adjusted basis, operating income increased 17.2% to $97.3 million, or 12.8% of sales, as compared with $83.0 million, or 14.3% of sales, in the prior year period.

Mapes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Higher capital investment and the drive for higher productivity have increased demand across our main product categories and trends remain positive. While we work to mitigate inflationary headwinds, we are continuing to invest in long-term profitable growth. In the quarter, our European integration team continued to pace ahead of plan and we celebrated the grand opening of our new Welding Technology and Training Center.

Management believes that excluding these special items enables them to make better period-over-period comparisons and benchmark the Company's operational performance against other companies in its industry more meaningfully. Furthermore, management believes that non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with meaningful information that provides a more complete understanding of Company operating results and enables investors to analyze financial and business trends more thoroughly. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed in isolation, are not a substitute for GAAP measures and have limitations including, but not limited to, their usefulness as comparative measures as other companies may define their non-GAAP measures differently.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe Company’s expectations and beliefs concerning the future contained in this news release are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
