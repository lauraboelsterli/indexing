The big finishes for American athletes comes five years after the Boston Marathon bombing , which killed three people and left hundreds injured including runners and spectators of the race.\nThe moment Des Linden made the move and got out front\nThe call with @LisaWBZ @LevanReid @KVSwitzer #WBZ #BostonMarathon pic.twitter.com/7w3wodAUKX\n‚Äî Jessi Miller Bradley (@JessiWBZ) April 16, 2018\nLast year, Linden came in fourth at the Boston Marathon, and in 2011, she came in second, nearly missing a first-place finish.\nDuring this year‚Äôs Boston Marathon ‚Äî even before her win ‚Äî Linden made headlines for stalling to wait for fellow American Shalane Flanagan, who had to stop and duck into a port-a-potty towards the beginning of the race. Flanagan, who won the New York Marathon in 2017 , placed sixth in Monday‚Äôs Boston Marathon.\nIn record cold temps, Desi Linden‚Äôs #Bostonmarathon :\n-Waited back for her countrywoman, Shalane Flanagan to take a bathroom break\n-Caught back up to the pack\n-Won the race in an unofficial time of 2:39:54, becoming the first American woman to win since 1985.\nBoom.\n‚Äî Malika Andrews (@malika_andrews) April 16, 2018\nShalane Flangagan, who won NYC Marathon in Nov and is aiming to win her hometown Boston Marathon, stops in a porta potty about midway through the race. Fellow American Desi Linden lags behind to help her rejoin the lead pack.\n‚Äî Sara Germano (@germanotes) April 16, 2018\nIn 1985, Lisa Larsen Weidenbach won the Boston Marathon. That 1985 race was one year before prize money started being awarded to winners, according to NBC Sports , an incentive for more runners around the world to take part in the marathon.",
