    "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - South Koreaâ€™s former president Park Geun-hye has submitted to a court a document disclosing her intention to give up on an appeal proceeding against her conviction for corruption, the Yonhap news agency reported on Monday.\nFILE PHOTO: Former South Korean President Park Geun-hye arrives at a court in Seoul, South Korea, August 7, 2017. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/File Photo However, her case is still expected to be heard in an appeals court as the prosecution filed an appeal last week, on the grounds that she had unfairly avoided certain charges, a court official said.\nA lower court jailed Park for 24 years this month on charges including bribery, abuse of power and coercion.\nShe had denied wrongdoing.\nA lawyer for Park could not be immediately reached.\nReporting by Joyce Lee; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ",
