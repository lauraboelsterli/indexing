    "text": "8 COMMENTS The improper use of oxygen masks should come as no surprise (“ Many Fliers on Plane Failed Air-Mask Test ,” U.S. News, April 20). It’s unrealistic to expect passengers in an emergency to remember safety instructions from a video or demonstration, no matter how entertaining or how often repeated. The solution isn’t better instruction, but better design. Masks should be designed so the natural use is the right use; they should fit more easily over the nose and mouth than over the mouth alone, feature a prominent “adults first” sign and have an outer layer that’s reassuringly full of air. Don’t blame users for bad design.\nRob Cook\nSan Anselmo, Calif.",
