    "text": "Impact of tariffs on China soybean supply being closely watched - ag ministry Published 16 Hours Ago Reuters \nBEIJING, April 10 (Reuters) - China is still watching for any impact to soybean supplies, after the government warned it would levy a 25 percent tariff on imports of the crop from the United States, the agriculture ministry said on Tuesday, the first official comment on the issue. \nCurrent supplies to the world's top buyer of soy were \"basically normal,\" the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said in its monthly crop report, with South America the main supplier to China during the first part of the year. \nBut further developments and the impact on supplies for the whole year must continue to be monitored, it added. \n(Reporting by Dominique Patton; Editing by Christian Schmollinger)",
