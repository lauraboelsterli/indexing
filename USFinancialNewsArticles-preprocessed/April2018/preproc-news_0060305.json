    "text": "24 COMMENTS James Nichter’s “ A Vietnam Myth That Refuses to Die ” (op-ed, April 20) based largely on an interview with Anna Chennault, absolves Chennault, leading female fundraiser of the 1968 Nixon presidential campaign, of her role in sabotaging Vietnam peace talks to help Nixon’s election. It is untrue in all respects. As Vice President Hubert Humphrey’s assistant, I had direct knowledge of the matter.\nThe Johnson White House learned through intelligence intercepts of Chennault’s discussions on Nixon’s behalf with the South Vietnamese ambassador. She urged the South Vietnamese to boycott peace negotiations with North Vietnam. Nixon, she said, would continue to support the South Vietnamese war effort whereas Humphrey had pledged to end the war in 1969. President Lyndon Johnson met with his national-security team and chose not to publicly disclose the Nixon-Chennault initiative. On Humphrey’s behalf I then asked James Rowe, a law partner of Chennault attorney Tommy Corcoran, to tell Corcoran and the South Vietnamese ambassador that we knew of the Nixon initiative and to urge South Vietnam to come to the conference table.\nTwo days before the election the South Vietnamese responded with an unequivocal no. Humphrey was furious. He stated he would enter negotiations with North Vietnam without the South Vietnamese. We didn’t publicly disclose the Nixon-Chennault intervention because we couldn’t reveal we knew of it from intercepts, and we anticipated that Nixon would simply brand it an election-eve campaign ploy.\nNixon did sidetrack peace negotiations immediately after his inauguration. More Americans died in Vietnam during the Nixon presidency than during the Kennedy and Johnson presidencies combined.\nTed Van Dyk\nBellingham, Wash.",
