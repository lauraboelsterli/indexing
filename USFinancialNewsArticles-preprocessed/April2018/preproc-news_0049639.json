    "text": "LONDON, April 23 (Reuters) - The gap between German and U.S. 10-year borrowing costs hit its widest level in nearly three decades in early trading on Monday following a sharp rise in U.S. Treasury yields.\nThe 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit its highest level since January 2014 at 2.9790 percent.\nThis briefly pushed the Germany/U.S. 10-year bond yield spread to 236 basis points, the widest since April 1989.\nYields in most Euro zone government bonds also rose between two and four basis points.
