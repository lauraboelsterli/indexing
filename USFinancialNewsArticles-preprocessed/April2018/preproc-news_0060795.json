    "text": "DUBAI, April 29 (Reuters) - Kuwait Finance House (KFH), the countryâ€™s biggest Islamic lender, reported a 13.9 percent rise in first-quarter net profit, according to a statement on Sunday.\nNet profit rose to 44.0 million dinars ($146 million) in the three months to March 31, from 38.6 million dinars in the same period a year ago, the statement said.\nEFG Hermes forecast the lender would make a quarterly net profit of 42.2 million dinars.\nThe bank said the increase in net profit for the period was due to a 12 percent rise in net operating income as a result of a growth in financing.
