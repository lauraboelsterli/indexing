    "text": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s financial watchdog has launched an on-site inspection of Suruga Bank Ltd ( 8358.T ) in connection with loans it made to customers for housing investment, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Friday.\nThe Financial Services Agency (FSA) last month ordered the bank to report on loans it made to retail customers who built so called share houses, where tenants share bathrooms and other facilities.\nThe regulator is checking whether senior officials were involved in falsifying documents used for examining customers’ ability to repay the loans, the Nikkei said.\nThe bank was not immediately reachable for comment on the FSA inspection.\nSuruga Bank, based in Shizuoka prefecture in central Japan, told Reuters last month that it made the loans to customers who invested in these facilities.\nThese are operated by a property firm Smart Days Inc, which this week filed for bankruptcy protection.\nSuruga Bank shares have fallen 36 percent since mid-January.\nReporting by Junko Fujita; Editting by William Mallard and Gopakumar Warrier\n ",
