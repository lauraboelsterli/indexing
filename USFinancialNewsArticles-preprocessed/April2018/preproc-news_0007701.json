    "text": "April 8, 2018 / 2:30 PM / Updated 4 hours ago Tennis-France, Croatia reach Davis Cup semis, Nadal keeps Spain alive Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nApril 8 (Reuters) - Holders France reached the semi-finals of the Davis Cup for a third year in a row after Lucas Pouille came back to beat Fabio Fognini 2-6 6-1 7-6(3) 6-3 in Genoa on Sunday and clinch their tie with Italy 3-1. \nCroatia also made it into the last four as Australian Open runner-up Marin Cilic crushed Kazakhstan’s Mikhail Kukushkin 6-1 6-1 6-1 to seal their tie 3-1. \nCroatia will meet the United States in the semis in September following Jack Sock and Ryan Harrison’s doubles win against Belgium’s Sander Gille and Joran Vliegen on Saturday which gave the U.S. a 3-0 win. \nWorld number one Rafael Nadal continued his impressive return from injury by dispatching fourth-ranked Alexander Zverev of Germany in straight sets 6-1 6-4 6-4 to keep Spain’s hopes of staying in the competition alive and forcing a fifth rubber between David Ferrer and German Philipp Kohlschreiber. \nFerrer and Kohlschreiber’s match was locked at one set each at the Plaza de Toros in Valencia on Sunday, which will determine who meets France in the other last four tie.
