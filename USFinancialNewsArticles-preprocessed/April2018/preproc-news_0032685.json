    "text": "April 19, 2018 / 6:17 AM / Updated 26 minutes ago Sky reports strong quarter before bid battle steps up Paul Sandle 3   Sky ( SKYB.L ), the pay-TV group at the centre of a takeover battle between Fox, Disney and Comcast, reported a strong third quarter on Thursday, underlining its appeal to rival U.S. entertainment groups who want to expand in Europe.

REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo \nChief Executive Jeremy Darroch said the British company was “well placed for the future” regardless of which company emerged as its ultimate owner. \nSky added 38,000 customers, taking its customer base to nearly 23 million homes. \nCore earnings for the nine months to end-March were up 10 percent to 1.7 billion pounds on like-for-like revenue up 5 percent to 10.1 billion pounds. \nThe latest battle to buy Sky started in December 2016, when Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox ( FOXA.O ), the owner of 39 percent of the company, agreed to buy the rest. \nSince then, the deal has been stuck in regulatory purgatory, a tortuous process due to end in June.
