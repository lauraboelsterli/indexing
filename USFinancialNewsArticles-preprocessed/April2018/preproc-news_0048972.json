    "text": "1 COMMENTS Earnings season is in full swing, with 17% of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported quarterly results through Friday and the majority of the firms in the index on deck over the next two weeks. \nIn all, the companies are expected to report an 18% jump in earnings for the quarter, according to FactSet, which would mark the highest growth rate since the first quarter of 2011. Analysts have been steadily raising that estimate in recent months as companies have touted the benefits of a lower tax rate, a healthy consumer and higher oil prices.\nOf the companies that have reported so far, 80% have posted per-share earnings that beat expectations of Wall Street analysts, with the companies on average topping estimates by 5.9%. Both of those metrics are ahead of five-year averages. At the sector level, health-care, energy and real-estate companies in the index have delivered the highest percentage of better-than expected performances, while materials and consumer-discretionary firms have underperformed.\nhttps://asset.wsj.net/dynamic-insets/charts/cdc_f38b81e8c49b454c90be004e.json \nUnitedHealth Group stock being traded on Jan. 31, 2018, at the New York Stock Exchange.

Companies that reported stronger-than-expected earnings have seen their shares on average rise by 0.1% two days before the earnings release through two days after, well below the five-year average increase of 1.1%. And the companies that disappointed by posting weaker-than-expected numbers have seen their shares slide 0.9% over the same period, much smaller than the five-year average decline of 2.4%.\nWrite to Michael Wursthorn at Michael.Wursthorn@wsj.com and Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com",
