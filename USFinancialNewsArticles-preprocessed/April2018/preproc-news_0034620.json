Obuv Rossii’s revenues increased by 6.1% up to RUB 2.257 bln. However prolonged winter over essential part of Russia in 1Q 2018 resulted in the shift of the spring season start, which impacted the LFL in 1Q 2018. The sales of the considerable part of the spring collection shifted to 2Q 2018. The Group significantly expanded the territory of its sales, opened 34 new stores and entered 10 new cities. In the first quarter, we achieved high results in e-commerce: traffic in Group’s online stores increased by 46%, the share of omnichannel sales in retail revenue reached 13.4%.
