FILE PHOTO: A statue is pictured next to the logo of Germany's Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt, Germany September 30, 2016. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File Photo \nThe German bank is now considering retaining the business under its new chief executive, Christian Sewing, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity. They noted that a final decision has not yet been made. \nA Deutsche Bank spokesman declined to comment. Bloomberg first reported the news earlier on Tuesday. \nDeutsche Bank has been active in India since the beginning of the 1980s. It employs more than 12,000 people in the country, though many work in IT support rather than in classical banking activities. \nThe German lender sold its Indian mortgage business in 2010 and its asset management business five years later.
