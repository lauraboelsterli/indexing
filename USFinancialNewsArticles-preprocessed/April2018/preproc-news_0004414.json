    "text": "Simon Dawson | Bloomberg | Getty Images The Pfizer logo sits on Viagra tablets, produced by Pfizer Inc. \nPfizer is in talks with Procter & Gamble on a sale of its consumer business, sources tell CNBC. \nThe business includes Chapstick lip balm, Advil pain reliever and Centrum vitamins and has been for sale for months. Drug giants GlaxoSmithKline and Reckitt Benckiser Group as well as J ohnson & Johnson have already looked at the business. \nP&G remains the one potential bidder, though the two sides are far apart on price, with P&G looking to pay $15 billion, while Pfizer was seeking $20 billion or more, the sources said. \nPfizer is considering other options, including a joint venture with other drug makers. The pharmaceutical giant hopes to reach a decision by the end of the month. It announced a review of the business last year. David Faber “Squawk on the Street” Co-Anchor Related Securities",
