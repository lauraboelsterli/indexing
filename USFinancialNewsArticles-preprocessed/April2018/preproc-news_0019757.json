The Sixers (51-30) lead the Cleveland Cavaliers (50-31) by one game heading into Wednesday’s finale. The Cavaliers host the New York Knicks on Wednesday.\nPhiladelphia led the Hawks 89-79 heading into the fourth quarter. Atlanta would not go away and cut the deficit to five with a John Collins put-back dunk with three minutes to play. However, Ben Simmons had a late dunk, and Ersan Ilyasova added a layup to help the Sixers finish off Atlanta.\nSimmons shook off an illness that put his status for Tuesday’s game in question to score 14 points, grab 10 rebounds and hand out six assists with six turnovers. Ilyasova scored 26 points off the bench and Marco Belinelli added 20 points for Philadelphia.\nTaurean Prince led the Hawks with 27 points. Prince set a Hawks franchise record with 18 3-point attempts in the game, making six. Tyler Dorsey had 17 points off the bench, and Dewayne Dedmon added 14 points and seven rebounds for Atlanta.\nThe 76ers haven’t lost since a 101-98 home defeat to the Indiana Pacers on March 13. Philadelphia is headed back to the playoffs for the time since 2012 and is expected to get All-Star center Joel Embiid back at some point in the postseason. Embiid has been out for two weeks since sustaining an orbital fracture and going through the NBA’s concussion protocol.\nStarting forward Dario Saric took an unintentional elbow to the mouth while battling for a rebound on the first possession of the game. He sustained a lacerated upper lip and did not return.\nAtlanta is in position for a high lottery after finishing the season at 24-58.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
