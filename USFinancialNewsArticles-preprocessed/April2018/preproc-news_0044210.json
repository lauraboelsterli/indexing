    "text": "April 20, 2018 / 3:24 PM / Updated 13 minutes ago Xerox, Fujifilm in talks to renegotiate deal - CNBC Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nApril 20 (Reuters) - Xerox Corp and Fujifilm Holdings are in active talks to renegotiate a deal the two struck in January, CNBC reported, citing comments made by the companies’ lawyers at a court hearing on Thursday. \nThe $6.1 billion deal, which would combine Xerox into an existing joint venture with Fuji, has been opposed by the printer copier maker’s top shareholders Darwin Deason and activist investor Carl Icahn, saying it unfairly favors Fuji. \nOn Tuesday, Icahn and Deason suggested alternatives to the merger including a plan for the U.S. company to monetize some assets. \nBoth Fujifilm and Xerox were not immediately available for comments.
