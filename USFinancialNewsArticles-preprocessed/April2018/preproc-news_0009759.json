    "text": "GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations human rights office urged Israel on Friday to ensure that its security forces do not use excessive force against Palestinian protesters at the Gaza-Israel border.\nIsraeli soldiers are seen next to the border fence on the Israeli side of the Israel-Gaza border, as black smoke rises while Palestinians protest on the Gaza side of the border April 6, 2018. REUTERS/Amir Cohen Firearms should only be used as a last resort, and unjustified recourse to their use may amount to wilful killing of civilians, a breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention, U.N. human rights spokeswoman Elizabeth Throssell told a briefing.\nA Palestinian died on Friday of wounds suffered a week ago during protests against Israel along the enclaveâ€™s border, health ministry officials said. That raised to 20 the death toll in confrontations with Israeli soldiers that began on March 30.\nReporting by Stephanie Nebehay, editing by Larry King\n ",
