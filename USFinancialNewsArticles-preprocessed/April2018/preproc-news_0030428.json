    "text": "LONDON, April 14 (Reuters) - Global energy trader Mercuria Group agreed to take an interest in the oil refining system of Chinaâ€™s ChemChina, sources familiar with the matter said.\nAs part of the deal, ChemChina would increase its stake in Mercuria. ChemChina already holds a 12 percent stake in the trading firm and would remain a minority shareholder.\nThe deal, once signed, would be the first time that a foreign company had gained a stake in Chinese refineries.
