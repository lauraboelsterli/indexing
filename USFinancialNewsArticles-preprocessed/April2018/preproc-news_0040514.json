    "text": "CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Chemed Corporation (Chemed) (NYSE: CHE), which operates VITAS Healthcare Corporation (VITAS), the nation’s largest provider of end-of-life care, and Roto-Rooter, the nation’s largest commercial and residential plumbing and drain cleaning services provider, reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018, versus the comparable prior-year period, as follows:\nConsolidated operating results:\nRevenue increased 8.2% to $439 million GAAP Diluted Earnings-per-Share of $2.66, an increase of 49.4% Adjusted Diluted EPS of $2.72, an increase of 49.5%\nVITAS segment operating results:\nNet Patient Revenue of $292 million, an increase of 3.4% Average Daily Census (ADC) of 17,209, an increase of 6.1% Admissions of 18,279, an increase of 4.1% Net Income of $32.0 million, an increase of 55.4% Adjusted EBITDA of $44.7 million, an increase of 16.3%\nRoto-Rooter segment operating results:\nRevenue of $147 million, an increase of 19.1% Net Income of $22.9 million, an increase of 56.9% Adjusted EBITDA of $33.9 million, an increase of 28.7% Adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.0%, an increase of 171 basis points\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) mandated changes in revenue recognition under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). For Chemed the accounting standard mandated reclassification of certain costs within the 2018 income statement when compared to prior-year formats. These reclassifications do not impact EBITDA, pretax income or net income. This accounting standard has been adopted on a modified retrospective basis, meaning prior-year results are not reclassified and are reported using historical revenue recognition accounting standards.\nThis resulted in the reclassification of net room and board expenses associated with certain patients residing in nursing homes to be reclassified from cost of services to revenue, effectively reducing VITAS revenue and cost of sales by $2.6 million. In addition, uncollectable accounts receivable, commonly referred to as normal bad debt expense, historically included in selling, general and administrative expenses for VITAS and Roto-Rooter, are now netted against service revenue and sales.\nThe discussion of operating results below does recast net room and board and estimated uncollectable receivables in the first quarter of 2017 to facilitate analysis of operating results in a format consistent with the 2018 revenue recognition accounting standard.\nVITAS\nVITAS net revenue was $292 million in the first quarter of 2018, which is an increase of 5.5%, when compared to the prior-year period. This revenue increase is comprised primarily of a geographically weighted average Medicare reimbursement rate increase of approximately 0.7%, a 6.1% increase in average daily census, and a reduction in Medicare Cap that increased revenue 0.6%. This growth is partially offset by acuity mix shift that negatively impacted revenue growth 1.8% when compared to the prior-year period.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, VITAS reversed $1.8 million in Medicare Cap billing limitations recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the 2018 Medicare Cap billing period.\nAt March 31, 2018, VITAS had 30 Medicare provider numbers, two of which have a current estimated 2018 Medicare Cap billing limitation of approximately $616,000.\nOf VITAS’ 30 unique Medicare provider numbers, 27 provider numbers have a Medicare Cap cushion of 10% or greater, one provider number has a cap cushion between 5% and 10% and two provider numbers have a Medicare Cap billing limitation for the 2018 Medicare Cap period.\nAverage revenue per patient per day in the quarter was $189.76, which is 1.2% below the prior-year period. Routine home care reimbursement and high acuity care averaged $163.53 and $706.24, respectively. During the quarter, high acuity days of care were 4.8% of total days of care, 60-basis points less than the prior-year quarter.\nThe first quarter of 2018 gross margin, excluding Medicare Cap, was 21.7%, which is a 97-basis point improvement when compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expense was $20.5 million in the first quarter of 2018, which is a favorable decrease of 2.4% compared to the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding Medicare Cap, totaled $42.9 million in the quarter, an increase of 11.6%. Adjusted EBITDA margin, excluding Medicare Cap, was 14.8% in the quarter which is an 89-basis point improvement when compared to the prior-year period.\nRoto-Rooter\nRoto-Rooter’s plumbing and drain cleaning business generated sales of $147 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $24.7 million, or 20.2%, over the prior-year quarter. Revenue from water restoration totaled $27.7 million, an increase of $9.6 million, or 53.3%, when compared to the prior-year quarter.\nRoto-Rooter’s gross margin in the quarter was 47.5%, a 69-basis point decline when compared to the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $33.9 million, an increase of 28.7%. The Adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter was 23.0% which is a 152-basis point improvement over the prior year.\nChemed Consolidated\nAs of March 31, 2018, Chemed had total cash and cash equivalents of $14 million and debt of $143 million.\nIn June 2014, Chemed entered into a five-year Amended and Restated Credit Agreement that consisted of a $100 million amortizable term loan and a $350 million revolving credit facility. The interest rate on this facility has a floating rate that is currently LIBOR plus 112.5 basis points. At March 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $244 million of undrawn borrowing capacity under this credit agreement.\nDuring the quarter, the Company repurchased 300,000 shares of Chemed stock for $81.1 million which equates to a cost per share of $270.42. On March 6, 2018, Chemed’s Board of Directors authorized an additional $150 million for stock repurchase under Chemed’s existing share repurchase program. As of March 31, 2018, there was $124.4 million of remaining share repurchase authorization under this plan.\nChemed restarted its share repurchase program in 2007. Since that time Chemed has repurchased 13.6 million shares, aggregating over $1.0 billion at an average share cost of $76.75. Including dividends over this period, Chemed has returned over $1.2 billion to shareholders.\nGuidance for 2018\nThe first-quarter 2018 operating results did exceed Chemed management’s expectations. The Company has reiterated the earnings guidance issued in February 2018 and anticipates providing updated guidance for the second half of 2018 when it reports second-quarter results.\nConference Call\nChemed will host a conference call and webcast at 10 a.m., ET, on Friday, April 20, 2018, to discuss the Company's quarterly results and to provide an update on its business.

In reporting its operating results, Chemed provides EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Diluted EPS measures to help investors and others evaluate the Company’s operating results, compare its operating performance with that of similar companies that have different capital structures and evaluate its ability to meet its future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Chemed’s management similarly uses EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Diluted EPS to assist it in evaluating the performance of the Company across fiscal periods and in assessing how its performance compares to its peer companies. These measures also help Chemed’s management to estimate the resources required to meet Chemed’s future financial obligations and expenditures. Chemed’s EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Diluted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We calculated Adjusted EBITDA Margin by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by service revenue and sales. A reconciliation of Chemed’s net income to its EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Diluted EPS is presented in the tables following the text of this press release.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements contained in this press release and the accompanying tables are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
