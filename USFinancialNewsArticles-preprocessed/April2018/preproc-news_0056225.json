    "text": "— Reports Earnings of 67 Cents per Diluted Share —\nSANTA ANA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- First American Financial Corporation (NYSE: FAF), a leading global provider of title insurance, settlement services and risk solutions for real estate transactions, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nCurrent Quarter Highlights\nTotal revenue of $1.3 billion, down 1 percent compared with last year Title Insurance and Services segment pretax margin of 8.6 percent Purchase revenues up 8 percent compared with last year Average revenue per order up 6 percent Closed orders per day up 1 percent Commercial revenues of $152.9 million, up 5 percent compared with last year Specialty Insurance segment total revenues up 3 percent, with a pretax margin of 8.7 percent Debt-to-capital ratio of 17.4 percent as of March 31, 2018 Cash flow from operations of $43.2 million, compared with $6.1 million last year\nSelected Financial Information\n($ in millions, except per share data)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Total revenue $ 1,297.4 $ 1,317.0 Income before taxes 93.1 83.9 Net income $ 76.2 $ 58.3 Net income per diluted share 0.67 0.52 Total revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.3 billion, a decline of 1 percent relative to the first quarter of 2017. Net income in the current quarter was $76.2 million, or 67 cents per diluted share, compared with net income of $58.3 million, or 52 cents per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. Net realized investment losses in the current quarter were $5.7 million, or 4 cents per diluted share, compared with net realized losses of $0.1 million last year. This quarter’s effective tax rate of 18.2 percent includes a benefit of $4.7 million, or 4 cents per diluted share, related to stock-based compensation. In the first quarter of 2017, stock-based compensation also reduced the effective tax rate due to the impact of a $2.4 million benefit, or 2 cents per diluted share.\n“The year is off to a strong start, with the company achieving a pretax title margin of 8.6 percent in the first quarter,” said Dennis J. Gilmore, chief executive officer at First American Financial Corporation. “Revenue growth in our purchase and commercial businesses largely offset the impact of the downward trend in refinance transactions. We benefited from our continued focus on operating efficiency and from higher investment income driven by the rise in short-term interest rates.\n“As we approach the peak of the spring selling season, we remain optimistic about the outlook for 2018. Given the ongoing economic expansion and current trends in the housing market, we expect further revenue growth in our purchase business. Our commercial business has a healthy pipeline of activity and we will continue to benefit from rising investment income.\n“Longer term, First American is well positioned in the marketplace, with a strong balance sheet and ample financial flexibility to take advantage of strategic growth opportunities. We are focused on growing our core title and settlement business and leveraging our unique assets, such as our data, technology and bank, to provide innovative solutions to our customers.”\nTitle Insurance and Services\n($ in millions, except average revenue per order)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Total revenues $ 1,185.5 $ 1,202.9 Income before taxes $ 102.4 $ 98.2 Pretax margin 8.6 % 8.2 % Direct open orders 254,500 259,600 Direct closed orders 173,600 191,300 U.S. Commercial Total revenues $ 152.9 $ 146.3 Open orders 31,500 31,400 Closed orders 19,000 19,200 Average revenue per order $ 8,100 $ 7,600 Total revenues for the Title Insurance and Services segment during the first quarter were $1.2 billion, down 1 percent compared with the same quarter of 2017. Direct premiums and escrow fees were up 3 percent compared with the first quarter of 2017, driven by a 13 percent increase in the average revenue per direct title order that was largely offset by a 9 percent decline in the number of direct title orders closed. The growth in the average revenue per direct title order to $2,303 was primarily attributable to the shift in the order mix to higher-premium residential purchase and commercial transactions, the increase in the average revenue per commercial order, and higher residential real estate values. Agent premiums, which are recorded on approximately a one-quarter lag relative to direct premiums, were down 8 percent in the current quarter as compared with last year, primarily due to the decline in refinance activity.\nInformation and other revenues were $186.0 million this quarter, up 3 percent compared with the same quarter of last year. Higher revenues from recent acquisitions were partly offset by lower revenues from the company’s centralized lender business, largely due to the decline in refinance and foreclosure activity.\nInvestment income was $41.4 million in the first quarter, up $14.8 million, or 56 percent, primarily due to the increase in short-term interest rates that drove higher interest income in the company’s investment portfolio and cash balances. Net realized investment losses totaled $3.8 million in the current quarter, compared with losses of $0.2 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nPersonnel costs were $393.6 million in the first quarter, an increase of $8.8 million, or 2 percent, compared with the same quarter of 2017. This increase was driven by personnel costs associated with recent acquisitions. In addition, higher incentive compensation expenses were offset by lower employee benefit costs, and temporary labor and severance costs.\nOther operating expenses were $190.9 million in the first quarter, up $7.6 million, or 4 percent, compared with the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily driven by the impact of recent acquisitions and a net increase in spending across a number of expense categories.\nThe provision for policy losses and other claims was $38.5 million in the first quarter, or 4.0 percent of title premiums and escrow fees, unchanged from the first quarter of 2017. The current quarter rate reflects an ultimate loss rate of 4.0 percent for the current policy year and no change in the loss reserve estimates for prior policy years.\nPretax income for the Title Insurance and Services segment was $102.4 million in the first quarter, compared with $98.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. Pretax margin was 8.6 percent in the current quarter, compared with 8.2 percent last year.\nSpecialty Insurance\n($ in millions)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Total revenues $ 113.4 $ 110.3 Income before taxes $ 9.9 $ 10.0 Pretax margin 8.7 % 9.1 % Total revenues for the Specialty Insurance segment were $113.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 3 percent compared with the first quarter of 2017. The home warranty business results benefited from lower claim frequency. While the company’s property and casualty business experienced higher than expected claim losses in the quarter, primarily due to higher severity, the overall loss ratio for the segment declined to 56.6 percent. However, due to $1.8 million in net realized investment losses, the pretax margin was 8.7 percent, compared with 9.1 percent in the first quarter of last year.\nTeleconference/Webcast\nFirst American’s first quarter 2018 results will be discussed in more detail on Thursday, April 26, 2018, at 11 a.m. EDT, via teleconference.
