    "text": "TORONTO, April 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- McEwen Mining Inc. (NYSE:MUX) (TSX:MUX) reports consolidated production for Q1 2018 of 35,069 gold ounces and 695,651 silver ounces, or 44,344 gold equivalent ounces (1) (“GEOs”), using a 75:1 gold to silver ratio.\nConsolidated Production Summary\nQ1 ‘18 Q4 ‘17 Q3 ‘17 Q2 ‘17 Q1 ‘17 Gold ounces 35,069 48,609 19,051 22,191 20,096 Silver ounces 695,651 926,739 749,749 779,487 722,767 GEOs 44,344 60,965 29,047 32,584 29,733 Highlights of the first quarter from our three producing mines and our newest mine in Nevada, which is under construction, are as follows:\nGold Bar Mine, USA (100%)\nConstruction activities at Gold Bar focused on finishing civil works related to the heap leach pad, ponds and site infrastructure, in preparation for major equipment and material deliveries in the second quarter. Construction is advancing on schedule for completion by the end of 2018. During the first three years of operation beginning in 2019 Gold Bar is projected to produce 55,000 , 74,000 and 68,000 ounces of gold respectively.\nBlack Fox Mine, Canada (100%)\nBlack Fox produced 12,078 GEOs, in line with our full year production guidance for 2018 of 48,000 GEOs. A $12 million exploration program is ongoing across the Black Fox Complex, drilling results and other developments will be released quarterly, with the next update anticipated by the end of April.\nA new technical report and resource/reserve estimates for the Black Fox Complex was published on April 6, 2018. The complete report, with an effective date of October 31, 2017, is available on the Company’s website and on www.sedar.com . For comparative purposes the previous resource/reserve estimates by the former property owner had an effective date of December 31, 2016. The new mineral resource estimate for the Black Fox Mine resulted in a 40% increase in gold resource in the Indicated category to 538,000 ounces, and a decrease of 2% in the Inferred category to 44,000 ounces (see Table i) . The overall increase is mainly attributable to improvements in methodology used to constrain high and low-grade domains within lithological and alteration envelopes. This significantly reduced internal dilution that previously resulted in the exclusion of potential resource. Additionally, capping grades and variography parameters were reviewed and tailored to each domain.\nThe new mineral reserve estimate for the Black Fox Mine resulted in a 2% increase in Proven and Probable gold reserves to 113,000 ounces (see Table ii) .\nResource estimates for the Froome and Grey Fox deposits were also updated. The new Froome resource estimate is in line with the previous estimate. At Grey Fox, the updated resource considered a potential underground mining scenario (previously open pit and underground) and was calculated using additional drill hole data, updated geological and structural interpretations and tighter controls on the estimation process. Comparing underground resources only, gold resource in the Indicated category increased by 44% to 465,000 ounces, and the Inferred category decreased by 32% to 100,000 ounces.\nEl Gallo Mine, Mexico (100%)\nEl Gallo produced 12,217 GEOs, in line with our budget and full year production guidance for 2018 of 32,000 GEOs. Mining from the existing open pits will cease in Q2, while heap leaching activities are expected continue until 2020, or as long as it remains economical to do so. Operating expenses will diminish significantly in Q2, while gold production will decline more gradually, resulting in an overall reduction in cost per ounce produced for the balance of 2018.\nSan José Mine, Argentina (49%)\nOur attributable production from San José was 10,822 gold ounces and 692,052 silver ounces, for a total of 20,049 GEOs. Production at San José in the first quarter is typically lower than other quarters due to regularly scheduled maintenance, however the mine is on-track to achieve our full year guidance for 2018 of 91,000 GEOs. We received approximately $5 million in dividends from our interest in San José during Q1, and with spot gold and silver prices significantly above budget, we expect to continue to receive dividends in each of the subsequent quarters.\nFirst Quarter Financial Results\nOperating costs for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 will be released with our 10-Q Quarterly Financial Statements in early May. As of April 6, 2018 we are debt-free with liquid assets of approximately $52 million.\nTable i: Mineral Resource Statement, Black Fox Complex, SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc., October 31, 2017\nClassification Cut-off Grade\nGold (g/t) Quantity\n(‘000 t) Grade Gold\n(g/t) Contained Metal\nGold (‘000 oz) Indicated Mineral Resource Underground Black Fox 3.00 2,145 7.80 538 Froome 3.20 941 5.26 159 Grey Fox 3.60 2,177 6.64 465 Total Indicated 5,263 6.87 1,162 Inferred Mineral Resource Underground Black Fox 3.00 216 6.35 44 Froome 3.20 125 4.70 19 Grey Fox 3.60 453 6.83 100 Total Inferred 794 6.36 163 Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. All figures rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimates. Composites were capped where appropriate. Mineral resources reported at variable cut-off grades as indicated, assuming an underground extraction scenario, a gold price of US$1,500/oz, C$:US$ exchange rate of 1.25; and metallurgical gold recoveries of 96 percent for Black Fox, 90 percent for Froome and 80 percent for Grey Fox.\nTable ii: Mineral Reserve Statement, Black Fox Mine, SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc., October 31, 2017\nClassification Quantity (‘000 t) Grade Gold\n(g/t) Contained Metal\nGold (‘000 oz) Proven Mineral Reserve Underground - - - Total Proven - - - Probable Mineral Reserve Underground 395 8.88 113 Total Probable 395 8.88 113 Mineral reserves are included in the mineral resources . All figures have been rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimate. Mineral reserves are based on a cut-off value of 3.72 g/t gold (4.28 g/t including 15% dilution) assuming a gold price of US$1,250/oz, a C$:US$ exchange rate of 1.25:1:00, milling recoveries of 96%, royalty of 4.55%, and operating cost of C$171/t. Mineral reserves are stated at a mill feed reference point and include for diluting materials and mining losses.\nAbout McEwen Mining\nMcEwen has the goal to qualify for inclusion in the S&P 500 Index by creating a profitable gold and silver producer focused in the Americas.
