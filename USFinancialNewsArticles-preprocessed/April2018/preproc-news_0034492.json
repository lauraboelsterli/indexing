(Nasdaq:SHLM) today announced that it has established a record date of May 7, 2018, and a meeting date of June 14, 2018, for a special meeting of its stockholders to, among other things, consider and vote on a proposal to approve the previously announced Agreement and Plan of Merger with LyondellBasell Industries N.V. and LYB Americas Holdco Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of LyondellBasell.
