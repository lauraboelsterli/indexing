    "text": "Trump on Russia probe: 'No Collusion or Obstruction (other than I fight back)' Published 8 Hours Ago The Associated Press \nPresident Donald Trump is raging against what he calls the \"corrupt Russia Investigation,\" saying that there is \"No Collusion or Obstruction (other than I fight back).\" \nTrump tweeted Wednesday that the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian meddling in the 2016 election \"takes tremendous time and focus.\" He also complained about the Monday FBI raid of the office of his personal attorney, Michael Cohen, saying \"they do the Unthinkable, and RAID a lawyers office for information! BAD!\" TRUMP TWEET \nThe president was so incensed by the FBI's raid of his personal attorney's office and hotel room that he's privately pondered firing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and publicly mused about ousting Mueller. \nFive people familiar with the president's views say the raid of Cohen's records left the president more angry than advisers had seen him in weeks. Trump himself tweeted that \"Attorney-client privilege is dead!\" \nNervous White House aides have expressed new fears about the president's unpredictability in the face of the Cohen raid, which he viewed as an assault on a longtime defender and a sign that Mueller's probe into potential ties between Russia and the Trump campaign was \"going too far.\" \nThe president also pushed back against reports of tumult within his administration, which has seen a flood of high-level exits and is plagued by reports of internal conflict. He says it is \"Very calm and calculated.\" ",
