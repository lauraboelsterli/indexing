    "text": "April 18, 2018 / 9:38 PM / Updated an hour ago Qualcomm begins layoffs as part of cost cuts Munsif Vengattil 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc ( QCOM.O ) has begun cutting jobs as part of its promise to investors to cut annual costs by $1 billion, the chipmaker said on Wednesday. FILE PHOTO: The logo of Qualcomm is seen during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain February 27, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman \n“Qualcomm is conducting a reduction of our full-time and temporary workforce,” a company spokesperson who declined to be identifies said, without disclosing the exact numbers of job cuts. \nThough the company first evaluated non-headcount expense reductions, it concluded that a workforce reduction is needed to support long-term growth and success, the spokesperson said. \nQualcomm said it offered affected employees severance packages. It employed about 33,800 full-time, part-time and temporary employees, as of Sept 24. \nBloomberg, which first reported the layoffs, said the size of the job cuts is large enough that Qualcomm will have to file a WARN notice, or Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification, with the state of California. \nQualcomm had in January said it would implement a series of targeted reductions across businesses to save $1 billion in annual costs, as part of its attempt to win over investors support against a hostile bid from rival Broadcom Inc ( AVGO.O ). \nThe bid, however, was canceled by the Trump administration on national security grounds. \nThe chipmaker has been ramping up its operations since then to improve earnings growth.
