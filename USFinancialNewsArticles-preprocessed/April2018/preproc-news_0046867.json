    "text": "JACKSON, Miss.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Trustmark Corporation (NASDAQ:TRMK) reported net income of $36.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, representing diluted earnings per share of $0.54. Diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of 2018 increased 12.5% when compared to core earnings in the previous quarter and 17.4% when compared to the same period in the prior year. This level of earnings resulted in a return on average tangible equity of 13.05% and a return on average assets of 1.10%. Trustmark’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share payable June 15, 2018, to shareholders of record on June 1, 2018.\nThis press release features multimedia.

Host, President and CEO, stated, “The first quarter marked a positive start to 2018, as we placed continued emphasis on balance sheet optimization, capital deployment and disciplined expense management. The strong performance of our mortgage and insurance businesses shows the value of our diverse business model. Thanks to our talented associates, solid profitability and strong capital base, Trustmark remains well positioned to continue meeting the needs of our customers and creating long-term value for our shareholders.”\nBalance Sheet Management\nContinued balance sheet optimization through maturing investment securities run-off and opportunistic share repurchases Capital base continues to provide flexibility in pursuing growth opportunities Noninterest-bearing deposits represent 27.4% of total deposits\nLoans held for investment totaled $8.5 billion at March 31, 2018, a decrease of 0.7% from the prior quarter and an increase of 6.4% from the comparable period one year earlier. Acquired loans totaled $215.5 million at March 31, 2018, down $46.0 million from the prior quarter. Collectively, loans held for investment and acquired loans totaled $8.7 billion at March 31, 2018, down $102.0 million, or 1.2%, from the prior quarter.\nDeposits totaled $11.0 billion at March 31, 2018, up $398.3 million, or 3.8%, from the prior quarter. Trustmark continues to maintain an attractive, low-cost deposit base with approximately 60% of deposit balances in checking accounts. Deposit costs remain well controlled with the 9 basis point linked-quarter increase in interest bearing deposit cost driven in part by public fund deposits.\nTrustmark’s capital position remained solid, reflecting the consistent profitability of its diversified financial services businesses. During the first quarter, Trustmark repurchased $2.5 million of its common shares in open market transactions and has $96.7 million in remaining authority under its existing stock repurchase program, which expires March 31, 2019. At March 31, 2018, Trustmark’s tangible equity to tangible assets ratio was 9.00%, while the total risk-based capital ratio was 13.44%.\nCredit Quality\nOther real estate decreased 8.5% and 29.3% from the prior quarter and year-over-year, respectively Recoveries exceeded charge-offs; net recoveries represented -0.03% of average loans Allowance for loan losses represented 314.28% of nonperforming loans, excluding specifically reviewed impaired loans\nNonperforming loans totaled $68.7 million at March 31, 2018, up 1.7% from the prior quarter and 12.1% year-over-year. Other real estate totaled $39.6 million, reflecting a decline of 8.5% from the previous quarter and 29.3% from the same period one year earlier. Collectively, nonperforming assets totaled $108.3 million, reflecting a linked-quarter decrease of 2.3% and year-over-year decrease of 7.7%.\nAllocation of Trustmark's $81.2 million allowance for loan losses represented 1.04% of commercial loans and 0.64% of consumer and home mortgage loans, resulting in an allowance to total loans held for investment of 0.95% at March 31, 2018, representing a level management considers commensurate with the inherent risk in the loan portfolio. Collectively, the allowance for both held for investment and acquired loan losses represented 0.98% of total loans, which includes held for investment and acquired loans.\nUnless otherwise noted, all of the above credit quality metrics exclude acquired loans.\nRevenue Generation\nNet interest margin, excluding acquired loans, was 3.37%, an increase of 2 basis points from the prior quarter Maturing investment securities run-off is accretive to the net interest margin Deposit costs remain well controlled Noninterest income totaled $46.8 million, up 6.4% linked quarter and 1.7% year-over-year\nNet interest income (FTE) in the first quarter totaled $105.3 million, resulting in a net interest margin of 3.46%, down 2 basis points from the prior quarter. Relative to the prior quarter, net interest income (FTE) decreased $3.8 million, reflecting a $3.2 million decrease in interest income and a $592 thousand increase in interest expense. During the first quarter of 2018, the yield on acquired loans totaled 8.13% and included $594 thousand in recoveries from the settlement of debt, which represented approximately 0.99% of the annualized total acquired loan yield. The net interest margin was negatively impacted by approximately 6 basis points linked-quarter and year-over-year due to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which reduced the fully tax equivalent adjustment as a result of the lower corporate tax rate. This compression year-over-year is principally offset by the runoff of maturing investment securities, while linked quarter is offset by the runoff of maturing investment securities and quarterly day count.\nNoninterest income in the first quarter increased 6.4% from the prior quarter to total $46.8 million, as higher mortgage banking revenues and insurance commissions more than offset seasonal reductions in various fee-income categories. Mortgage banking revenue totaled $11.3 million in the first quarter, up $5.0 million from the prior quarter and $1.1 million year-over-year. The linked-quarter change reflects a net positive mortgage valuation adjustment and a net positive mortgage servicing hedge ineffectiveness that more than offset decreased secondary marketing gains. Mortgage loan production totaled $289.1 million, down 14.3% from the prior quarter and 4.7% year-over-year. Insurance revenue totaled $9.4 million in the first quarter, up 6.9% from the prior quarter and 2.2% year-over-year; this performance primarily reflects growth in the group health insurance and property and casualty businesses.\nWealth management revenue in the first quarter totaled $7.6 million, down 2.0% and up 2.1% from the prior quarter and year-over-year, respectively. The linked-quarter decline is primarily attributable to decreased commission-based transactions within investment services. Bank card and other fees declined $640 thousand from the prior quarter due to seasonal reductions in interchange income and other miscellaneous bank fees. Service charges on deposit accounts declined $336 thousand from the prior quarter, reflecting seasonal reductions in NSF and overdraft fees.\nNoninterest Expense\nTotal noninterest expense declined 0.5% linked quarter and increased 0.4% year-over-year to $102.5 million Core noninterest expense, which excludes other real estate expense and intangible amortization, totaled $100.2 million, down 0.6% from the prior quarter and up 1.5% year-over-year\nSalaries and employee benefits decreased $345 thousand from the prior quarter to total $58.5 million. Services and fees increased 2.1%, or $327 thousand, linked-quarter. Other real estate expense totaled $866 thousand, up $200 thousand from the prior quarter, while net occupancy-premises expense totaled $6.5 million, down 1.7% from the prior quarter. Other expense totaled $11.8 million, a decline of $783 thousand, or 6.2%, on a linked-quarter basis.\nTrustmark remains committed to optimization of its retail delivery channels to promote additional growth. In the first quarter, Trustmark opened a location in Pensacola, Florida, that not only serves as a branch, but also as headquarters for the Fisher Brown Bottrell Insurance agency.\nAdditional Information\nAs previously announced, Trustmark will conduct a conference call with analysts on Wednesday, April 25, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. Central Time to discuss the Corporation’s financial results.

Reliance Bank was merged into Trustmark National Bank simultaneously with the merger of Trustmark and RB Bancorporation. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement dated November 14, 2016, Trustmark paid $22.00 in cash for each share of Reliance common stock outstanding, which represented total consideration for Reliance common shareholders of approximately $23.7 million. In addition, Trustmark paid off Reliance Preferred Stock of $1.1 million bringing the total consideration paid to $24.8 million.\nThis merger was accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 805, “Business Combinations.” Accordingly, the assets and liabilities, both tangible and intangible, were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the merger date. The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are subject to adjustment if additional information relative to the closing date fair values becomes available through the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the merger date of April 7, 2017.\nThe excess of the consideration paid over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired was $13.5 million, which was recorded as goodwill under FASB ASC Topic 805. The identifiable intangible assets acquired represent the core deposit intangible at fair value at the merger date. The core deposit intangible is being amortized on an accelerated basis over the estimated useful life, currently expected to be approximately ten years.\nLoans acquired from Reliance were evaluated under a fair value process. Loans with evidence of deterioration in credit quality and for which it was probable at acquisition that Trustmark would not be able to collect all contractually required payments are referred to as acquired impaired loans and accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 310-30, “Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality.”\nThe operations of Reliance are included in Trustmark’s operating results from April 7, 2017 and did not have a material impact on Trustmark’s results of operations. During the second quarter of 2017, Trustmark included non-routine merger transaction expenses in other noninterest expense totaling $3.2 million (change in control expense of $1.3 million; professional fees, contract termination and other expenses of $1.9 million).\nNote 2 - Securities Available for Sale and Held to Maturity\nThe following table is a summary of the estimated fair value of securities available for sale and the amortized cost of securities held to maturity ($ in thousands):\n3/31/2018 12/31/2017 9/30/2017 6/30/2017 3/31/2017 SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE\nU.S. Government agency obligations Issued by U.S. Government agencies $ 40,118 $ 45,018 $ 49,723 $ 51,277 $ 53,247 Issued by U.S. Government sponsored agencies 263 267 271 272 274 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 75,013 79,229 89,144 96,514 109,895 Mortgage-backed securities Residential mortgage pass-through securities Guaranteed by GNMA 62,457 65,746 60,902 58,422 42,667 Issued by FNMA and FHLMC 767,676 814,450 860,131 860,571 733,214 Other residential mortgage-backed securities Issued or guaranteed by FNMA, FHLMC, or GNMA 954,537 1,016,790 1,087,169 1,157,241 1,202,719 Commercial mortgage-backed securities Issued or guaranteed by FNMA, FHLMC, or GNMA 197,433 217,135 221,749 223,391 223,538 Total securities available for sale $ 2,097,497 $ 2,238,635 $ 2,369,089 $ 2,447,688 $ 2,365,554 SECURITIES HELD TO MATURITY\nU.S. Government agency obligations Issued by U.S. Government sponsored agencies $ 3,703 $ 3,692 $ 3,680 $ 3,669 $ 3,658 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 46,011 46,039 46,069 46,098 46,273 Mortgage-backed securities Residential mortgage pass-through securities Guaranteed by GNMA 12,974 13,539 14,191 14,399 14,977 Issued by FNMA and FHLMC 128,517 133,975 139,172 144,282 118,733 Other residential mortgage-backed securities Issued or guaranteed by FNMA, FHLMC, or GNMA 653,325 678,926 708,715 740,042 771,296 Commercial mortgage-backed securities Issued or guaranteed by FNMA, FHLMC, or GNMA 179,445 180,315 190,456 191,264 201,130 Total securities held to maturity $ 1,023,975 $ 1,056,486 $ 1,102,283 $ 1,139,754 $ 1,156,067 TRUSTMARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALS March 31, 2018 ($ in thousands) (unaudited) Note 2 - Securities Available for Sale and Held to Maturity (continued)\nAt March 31, 2018, the net unamortized, unrealized loss included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying balance sheet for securities held to maturity previously transferred from securities available for sale totaled approximately $18.5 million ($13.9 million, net of tax).\nManagement continues to focus on asset quality as one of the strategic goals of the securities portfolio, which is evidenced by the investment of approximately 96% of the portfolio in GSE-backed obligations and other Aaa rated securities as determined by Moody’s.

In addition, the table includes net interest margin excluding acquired loans, which equals reported net interest income-FTE excluding interest income on acquired loans, annualized, as a percent of average earning assets excluding average acquired loans.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the yield on acquired loans totaled 8.13% and included $594 thousand in recoveries from the settlement of debt, which represented approximately 0.99% of the annualized total acquired loan yield. The net interest margin was negatively impacted by approximately 6 basis points linked quarter and year-over-year due to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform Act) which reduced the fully tax equivalent adjustment as a result of the lower corporate tax rate. This compression year-over-year is principally offset by the runoff of maturing investment securities, while linked quarter is offset by the runoff of maturing investment securities and quarterly day count.\nNote 5 – Mortgage Banking\nTrustmark utilizes a portfolio of exchange-traded derivative instruments, such as Treasury note futures contracts and option contracts, to achieve a fair value return that offsets the changes in fair value of mortgage servicing rights (MSR) attributable to interest rates. These transactions are considered freestanding derivatives that do not otherwise qualify for hedge accounting under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Changes in the fair value of these exchange-traded derivative instruments, including administrative costs, are recorded in noninterest income in mortgage banking, net and are offset by the changes in the fair value of the MSR. The MSR fair value represents the present value of future cash flows, which among other things includes decay and the effect of changes in interest rates. Ineffectiveness of hedging the MSR fair value is measured by comparing the change in value of hedge instruments to the change in the fair value of the MSR asset attributable to changes in interest rates and other market driven changes in valuation inputs and assumptions.\nThe following table illustrates the components of mortgage banking revenues included in noninterest income in the accompanying income statements:\nQuarter Ended 3/31/2018 12/31/2017 9/30/2017 6/30/2017 3/31/2017 Mortgage servicing income, net $ 5,588 $ 5,471 $ 5,295 $ 5,439 $ 5,458 Change in fair value-MSR from runoff (2,507 ) (2,605 ) (2,892 ) (2,896 ) (2,387 ) Gain on sales of loans, net 4,585 5,300 5,083 5,001 3,550 Other, net 295 (1,120 ) (450 ) 629 772 Mortgage banking income before hedge ineffectiveness 7,961 7,046 7,036 8,173 7,393 Change in fair value-MSR from market changes 9,521 1,168 (2,393 ) (1,291 ) 1,466 Change in fair value of derivatives (6,217 ) (1,930 ) (218 ) 2,126 1,326 Net positive (negative) hedge ineffectiveness 3,304 (762 ) (2,611 ) 835 2,792 Mortgage banking, net $ 11,265 $ 6,284 $ 4,425 $ 9,008 $ 10,185 TRUSTMARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALS March 31, 2018 ($ in thousands) (unaudited) Note 6 – Salaries and Employee Benefit Plans\nDefined Benefit Pension Plan\nPrior to 2017, Trustmark maintained a noncontributory tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan (Trustmark Capital Accumulation Plan, the “Plan”), in which substantially all associates who began employment prior to 2007 participated. As previously reported, on July 26, 2016, the Board of Directors of Trustmark authorized the termination of the Plan, effective as of December 31, 2016. To satisfy commitments made by Trustmark to associates (collectively, the “Continuing Associates”) covered through acquired plans that were merged into the Plan, the Board also approved the spin-off of the portion of the Plan associated with the accrued benefits of the Continuing Associates into a new plan titled the Trustmark Corporation Pension Plan for Certain Employees of Acquired Financial Institutions (the “Spin-Off Plan”), effective as of December 31, 2016, immediately prior to the termination of the Plan. In order to terminate the Plan, in accordance with Internal Revenue Service and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation requirements, Trustmark was required to fully fund the Plan on a termination basis and contributed the additional assets necessary to do so. The final distributions were made from current plan assets and a one-time pension settlement expense of $17.6 million was recognized when paid by Trustmark during the second quarter of 2017.\nNote 7 – Other Noninterest Income and Expense\nOther noninterest income consisted of the following for the periods presented ($ in thousands):\nQuarter Ended 3/31/2018 12/31/2017 9/30/2017 6/30/2017 3/31/2017 Partnership amortization for tax credit purposes $ (2,202 ) $ (2,478 ) $ (2,521 ) $ (2,287 ) $ (2,274 ) Increase in life insurance cash surrender value 1,738 1,816 1,813 1,782 1,714 Other miscellaneous income 1,523 3,343 4,448 6,142 2,451 Total other, net $ 1,059 $ 2,681 $ 3,740 $ 5,637 $ 1,891 Trustmark invests in partnerships that provide income tax credits on a Federal and/or State basis (i.e., new market tax credits, low income housing tax credits and historical tax credits). The income tax credits related to these partnerships are utilized as specifically allowed by income tax law and are recorded as a reduction in income tax expense.\nTrustmark received no nontaxable proceeds related to bank-owned life insurance during the first quarter of 2018 compared to nontaxable proceeds of $1.7 million and $2.7 million during the fourth and third quarters of 2017, respectively, and $4.9 million related to life insurance acquired as part of a previous acquisition during the second quarter of 2017, which were recorded in other miscellaneous income in the table above.\nOther noninterest expense consisted of the following for the periods presented ($ in thousands):\nQuarter Ended 3/31/2018 12/31/2017 9/30/2017 6/30/2017 3/31/2017 Loan expense $ 2,791 $ 2,276 $ 3,013 $ 2,827 $ 2,792 Amortization of intangibles 1,397 1,522 1,539 1,544 1,564 Defined benefit plans non-service cost reclass\nfrom salaries and employee benefits\n885 968 966 1,875 1,913 Other miscellaneous expense 6,709 7,799 7,885 10,550 8,432 Total other expense $ 11,782 $ 12,565 $ 13,403 $ 16,796 $ 14,701 Trustmark adopted ASU 2017-07, “Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715)-Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost” effective January 1, 2018 and was required to reclassify the defined benefit plans non-service cost from salaries and employee benefits to other expense on the consolidated statements of income for each period presented.\nAs previously discussed in Note 1 – Business Combinations, non-routine Reliance merger transaction expenses totaled $3.2 million and were included in other miscellaneous expense during the second quarter of 2017.\nTRUSTMARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALS March 31, 2018 ($ in thousands) (unaudited) Note 8 – Income Taxes\nThe income tax provision consisted of the following for the periods presented ($ in thousands):\nQuarter Ended 3/31/2018 12/31/2017 9/30/2017 6/30/2017 3/31/2017 Current $ 2,180 $ 3,850 $ 8,108 $ 5,427 $ 5,261 Deferred 3,300 4,300 600 300 3,900 Elimination of deferred tax valuation allowance — (8,650 ) — — — Income tax provision before re-measurement 5,480 (500 ) 8,708 5,727 9,161 Re-measurement of net deferred tax assets — 25,619 — — — Income tax provision $ 5,480 $ 25,119 $ 8,708 $ 5,727 $ 9,161 During 2013, a deferred tax valuation allowance was created as a result of Trustmark’s merger with BancTrust Financial Group, Inc. and was established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that was more likely than not to be realized in future years. Trustmark has continually evaluated this allowance since inception and, based on the weight of the available evidence, has determined that the deferred tax assets will not be subject to the limitations on the deductibility of built-in losses (Internal Revenue Service Code, Section 382) in future years. Therefore, during the fourth quarter of 2017, the valuation allowance was eliminated creating a decrease in deferred income tax expense of $8.7 million.\nFollowing the recent enactment of the Tax Reform Act which resulted in the reduction of the corporate federal income tax rate, Trustmark re-measured its net deferred tax assets and recorded an increase in deferred income tax expense of $25.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNote 9 – Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to capital ratios defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and banking regulators, Trustmark utilizes various tangible common equity measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy. Tangible common equity, as defined by Trustmark, represents common equity less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.\nTrustmark believes these measures are important because they reflect the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures allows readers to compare certain aspects of Trustmark’s capitalization to other organizations. These ratios differ from capital measures defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes shareholders’ equity associated with preferred securities, the nature and extent of which varies across organizations. In Management’s experience, many stock analysts use tangible common equity measures in conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare capital adequacy of banking organizations with significant amounts of goodwill or other tangible assets, typically stemming from the use of the purchase accounting method in accounting for mergers and acquisitions.\nThese calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by GAAP and banking regulators. Because GAAP does not include these capital ratio measures, Trustmark believes there are no comparable GAAP financial measures to these tangible common equity ratios. Despite the importance of these measures to Trustmark, there are no standardized definitions for them and, as a result, Trustmark’s calculations may not be comparable with other organizations. Also there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, Trustmark encourages readers to consider its consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

Trustmark views net income adjusted for significant non-routine transactions as a measure of our core operating business, which excludes the impact of the items detailed below, as these items are generally not operational in nature. This non-GAAP measure also provides another basis for comparing period-to-period results as presented in the accompanying selected financial data table and the audited consolidated financial statements by excluding potential differences caused by non-operational and unusual or non-recurring items. Readers are cautioned that these adjustments are not permitted under GAAP. Trustmark encourages readers to consider its consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nThe following table presents adjustments to net income and select financial ratios as reported in accordance with GAAP resulting from significant non-routine items occurring during the periods presented ($ in thousands, except per share data):\nQuarter Ended 3/31/2018 12/31/2017 3/31/2017 Amount Diluted EPS Amount Diluted EPS Amount Diluted EPS Net Income (GAAP) $ 36,830 $ 0.542 $ 15,768 $ 0.232 $ 31,248 $ 0.461 Significant non-routine transactions (net of taxes): Re-measurement of net deferred taxes — — 25,619 0.377 — — Elimination of deferred tax valuation allowance — — (8,650 ) (0.127 ) — — Net Income adjusted for significant non-routine\ntransactions (Non-GAAP)\n$ 36,830 $ 0.542 $ 32,737 $ 0.482 $ 31,248 $ 0.461\nReported Adjusted Reported Adjusted Reported Adjusted (GAAP) (Non-GAAP) (GAAP) (Non-GAAP) (GAAP) (Non-GAAP) Return on equity 9.50 % n/a 3.96 % 8.22 % 8.27 % n/a Return on average tangible equity 13.05 % n/a 5.60 % 11.30 % 11.39 % n/a Return on assets 1.10 % n/a 0.45 % 0.94 % 0.95 % n/a n/a - not applicable\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180424006356/en/\nTrustmark Investor Contacts:\nLouis E.
