(“PRA” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:PRAH) today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, revenue was $701.8 million, which represents growth of 43.9%, or $214.1 million, compared to the first quarter of 2017 at actual foreign exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, revenue grew $198.3 million, an increase of 40.7% compared to the first quarter of 2017. On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” or ASC 606, using the modified retrospective method for all contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. The prior periods were not restated under this guidance and remain as previously reported. The primary impact of applying this new guidance on our statement of operations is that (i) we now recognize reimbursements from our customers for payments to investigators as revenue, whereas these payments and costs were previously recorded on a net basis, and (ii) we include all reimbursed costs in the total project costs when measuring our progress under our research contracts instead of recording these amounts on a separate basis.\nThe impact of the adoption of ASC 606 on the Company’s revenue is summarized below:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 Three Months\nEnded March 31,\n2017\nAs Reported As Reported Reclassification\nfrom adoption of\nASC 606 Impact from\nadoption of\nASC 606 Balances\nwithout\nadoption of\nASC 606 Revenue: Revenue $ 701,837 $ (636,362 ) $ (65,475 ) $ — $ — Service revenue — 559,921 — 559,921 427,080 Reimbursement revenue — 76,441 — 76,441 60,680 Total revenue $ 701,837 $ — $ (65,475 ) $ 636,362 $ 487,760 Excluding the impact of the adoption of ASC 606 and reimbursement revenue, revenue increased $132.8 million, which represents growth of 31.1% at actual foreign exchange rates and 28.5% on a constant currency basis. Organic revenue growth, excluding the adoption of ASC 606, reimbursement revenue and $56.8 million of revenue attributable to our Data Solutions segment, was 17.8% at actual foreign exchange rates and 15.2% on a constant currency basis.\nNet new business for our Clinical Research segment for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $650.3 million, representing a net book-to-bill ratio of 1.29 for the period. Our calculation of the net book-to-bill ratio excludes the revenue impact of adopting ASC 606, excludes reimbursement revenue and excludes revenue from our Data Solutions segment. Net new business during the quarter contributed to an ending backlog of $3.8 billion at March 31, 2018.\n“We are off to another solid start and our first quarter results were in line with our expectations” said Colin Shannon, PRA’s Chief Executive Officer. “We continue to execute across the business and I was really pleased with our double-digit revenue and earnings growth and our 1.29 book-to-bill ratio. We are focused on client deliverables and our key strategic objectives, and we look forward to delivering strong results for the rest of 2018.”\nDirect costs were $381.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $287.5 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in direct costs was primarily due to an increase in labor-related costs of $50.9 million in our Clinical Research segment as we continue to hire billable staff to ensure appropriate staffing levels for our current studies and our future growth. In addition, our Data Solutions segment resulted in $40.6 million of incremental direct costs when compared to the first quarter of 2017. We also had an unfavorable impact of $14.0 million from fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates during the three months ended March 31, 2018. Excluding the impact of the adoption of ASC 606 and reimbursement revenue, direct costs were 68.1% of revenue during the first quarter of 2018 compared to 67.3% of revenue during the first quarter of 2017. The increase in direct costs as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the aforementioned increase in salaries and related benefits.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $91.7 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $74.3 million for the first quarter of 2017. Excluding the impact of the adoption of ASC 606 and reimbursement revenue, selling, general and administrative costs were 16.4% of revenue during the first quarter of 2018 compared to 17.4% of revenue during the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue is primarily attributable to our ability to continue to effectively leverage our selling and administrative functions.\nTransaction-related costs represent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration related to our recent acquisitions. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, we recorded an $11.6 million reduction in the fair value of the earn-out liability associated with the Symphony Health acquisition, which reflects updates to the current estimate.\nGAAP net income was $39.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, or $0.59 per share on a diluted basis, compared to GAAP net income of $25.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, or $0.39 per share on a diluted basis.\nEBITDA was $98.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, representing an increase of 70.9% compared to the first quarter of 2017. The increase in EBITDA was driven by lower foreign currency losses and the revaluation of the acquisition-related earn-out liability discussed above. Adjusted EBITDA was $95.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, representing growth of 38.2% compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted net income was $56.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, representing 39.1% growth compared to the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.85 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, representing 37.1% growth compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nA reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures, including EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share and our 2018 guidance, to the corresponding GAAP measures is included in this press release.\nGuidance\nThe Company is reaffirming its full year 2018 service revenue guidance to between $2.84 billion and $2.95 billion, GAAP net income per diluted share to between $2.80 and $2.95 and Adjusted Net Income per diluted share to between $4.00 and $4.15. We anticipate an annual effective income tax rate estimate of approximately 24%, which includes the expected impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our effective tax rate may differ from this estimate, due to, among other things, changes to estimates of the geographic allocation of our pre-tax income as well as changes in interpretations, analysis, and additional guidance that may be issued by regulatory agencies as it relates to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nOur guidance assumes a EURO rate of 1.25 and a GBP rate of 1.37. All other foreign currency exchange rates are as of January 31, 2018.\nConference Call Details\nPRA will host a conference call at 9:00 a.m. ET on April 26, 2018, to discuss the contents of this release and other relevant topics.

The Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement after the date of this release, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by applicable law.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release includes EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share, each of which are financial measures not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Management believes that these measures provide useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding our operating results as they exclude certain items whose fluctuation from period- to- period do not necessarily correspond to changes in the operating results of our business. As a result, management and our board of directors regularly use EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA as a tool in evaluating our operating and financial performance and in establishing discretionary annual bonuses. Adjusted EBITDA is also the basis for covenant compliance EBITDA, which is used in certain covenants in the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities. In addition, management believes that EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income (including adjusted net income per diluted share) facilitate comparisons of our operating results with those of other companies by backing out of GAAP net income items relating to variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense), taxation, and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense), which may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to operating performance. We believe that EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income (including adjusted net income per diluted share) are frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of issuers, many of which also present EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income (including adjusted net income per diluted share) when reporting their results in an effort to facilitate an understanding of their operating results.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these measures in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, because not all companies use identical calculations, these presentations of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income (including adjusted net income per diluted share) may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nEBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income (including diluted adjusted net income per share) represent EBITDA and net income (including diluted net income per share), respectively, adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, loss (gain) on disposal of fixed assets, loss on modification or extinguishment of debt, foreign currency losses (gains), other non-operating expense (income), equity in (gains) losses of unconsolidated joint ventures (net of tax), transaction-related costs, acquisition-related costs, severance costs and restructuring charges, prior year foreign research and development credits, lease termination expense, non-cash rent adjustment, adjustment to reflect amounts attributable to noncontrolling interest and other charges. Adjusted Net Income is also adjusted to exclude amortization of intangible assets, amortization of terminated interest rate swaps, and amortization of deferred financing costs. EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as measures of our liquidity. EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider such measures either in isolation or as substitutes for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP.\nSome of these limitations are:\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt;\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes;\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect historical capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\nalthough depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and\nother companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nBecause of these limitations, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business or as a measure of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations.\nConstant Currency\nConstant currency comparisons are based on translating local currency amounts in the current year period at actual foreign exchange rates for the prior year. The Company routinely evaluates its financial performance on a constant currency basis in order to facilitate period- to- period comparisons without regard to the impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates.\nPRA HEALTH SCIENCES, INC.

(Gain) loss on disposal of fixed assets represents the costs incurred in connection with the sale or disposition of fixed assets, primarily IT equipment and furniture and fixtures. We exclude these (gains) losses from adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income because they result from investing decisions rather than from decisions made related to our ongoing operations. Foreign currency losses, net primarily relates to gains or losses that arise in connection with the revaluation of short-term inter-company balances between our domestic and international subsidiaries. In addition, this amount includes gains or losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of third-party accounts receivable and payables denominated in a currency other than the local currency of the entity making the payment. We exclude these gains and losses from adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income because they result from financing decisions rather than from decisions made related to our ongoing operations and because fluctuations from period- to- period do not necessarily correspond to changes in our operating results. Other non-operating (income) expense, net represents income and expense that are non-operating and whose fluctuations from period- to -period do not necessarily correspond to changes in our operating results. Transaction-related costs for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 consist of fair-value revaluations of acquisition-related earn-out liabilities. Acquisition-related costs primarily relate to costs incurred in connection with due diligence performed in connection with contemplated acquisitions, the acquisition of Symphony Health, the acquisition of Nextrials, Inc., the acquisition of Parallel 6, Inc., and the integration cost for the Takeda joint venture, as well as costs related to other potential acquisitions to enhance our strategic objectives. Integration costs primarily consist of professional fees, rebranding costs, the elimination of redundant facilities and any other costs incurred directly related to the integration of these acquisitions. Lease termination expense represents charges incurred in connection with the termination of leases at locations that are no longer being used by the Company. Severance and restructuring charges represent amounts incurred in connection with the elimination of redundant positions within the organization, including positions eliminated in connection with acquisitions made by the Company. We have escalating leases that require the amortization of rent expense on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. The non-cash rent adjustment represents the difference between rent expense recorded in the consolidated statement of operations and the amount of cash actually paid. Represents charges incurred that are not considered part of our core operating results. Represents the tax effect of adjusted pre-tax income at our estimated effective tax rate.\nSource:PRA Health Sciences, Inc.",
