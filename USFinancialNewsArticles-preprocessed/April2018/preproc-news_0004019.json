    "text": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla., April 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ION Media today announced that it closed the purchase of the full power UHF broadcast TV station in Portland, Maine (WPME-TV) from Ironwood Communications. The station will affiliate with ION Television’s successful programming lineup, effective immediately, as WIPL-TV.\nThe transaction will expand the company’s station portfolio to 65 full power stations in 59 of the largest U.S. markets, and add nearly 400,000 new households to ION’s industry-leading broadcast reach.\n“We remain on course to expand our nationwide U.S. TV broadcast distribution footprint,” said Brandon Burgess, Chairman & CEO of ION Media. “We see dual benefits in our broadcast reach focus: Growing demand for ION Television’s programming lineup, plus having the preeminent UHF spectrum footprint in an increasingly wireless world.”\nThe acquisition also fortifies ION Media’s position as the largest U.S. holder of full power broadcast TV spectrum, covering 1.3 billion MHz pops across all key metropolitan areas, in the advent of wireless spectrum innovation and development.\nAbout ION Media\nION Media is an independent, privately held media company launched in 2007.
