    "text": "Jacob deGrom shut out the Padres on five hits over 7 1/3 innings Friday night and Asdrubal Cabrera had a hand in each of the Mets’ first four runs as New York scored a 5-1 victory in San Diego to snap a two-game losing streak.\nDeGrom ran his record to 3-0 while striking out eight and walking three in a 110-pitch effort. All five of the Padres’ hits were singles.\nMatt Harvey, who has lost his spot in the Mets’ rotation, pitched the ninth in relief and gave up a leadoff homer to Franchy Cordero to spoil the shutout before retiring the side.\nCabrera, meanwhile, scored the Mets’ first run in the first and then hit a three-run homer on the first pitch thrown by Padres reliever Craig Stammen with two out in the top of the seventh.\nCabrera opened the game with a double off Padres starter and loser Clayton Richard (1-3). Cabrera moved to third on a fly to right by Yoenis Cespedes and scored on a single by Todd Frazier.\nThe Mets and deGrom held onto the 1-0 lead until the seventh.\nJuan Lagares and Jose Lobaton opened the seventh with back-to-back singles off Richard putting Mets at the corners. DeGrom bunted, but Lagares was forced to hold at third while Lobaton advanced to second. Both runners were forced to hold as Amed Rosario grounded out to second.\nThe right-handed Stammen was summoned from the bullpen to replace the left-handed Richard, forcing the switch-hitting Cabrera to hit from the left side. He drove Stammen’s first pitch 394 feet into the right field stands for his fifth homer of the season.\nThe Mets added a run in the eighth after Padres reliever Kazuhisa Makita hit Lagares with two out. Lagares scored from first on Lobaton’s double to right-center.\nFreddy Galvis had two of the Padres’ hits while Christian Villanueva extended his hitting streak to 10 straight games with a sixth-inning single. The Padres have scored two runs over their last three games.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
