CarePayment’s unique engagement approach, and proven track record of increasing the financial health of both providers and their patients, continues to not only attract some of the most prestigious provider brands in the country, but also experienced, innovative talent like Brian.”\nBefore joining CarePayment, McCarthy served as vice president and general counsel at OccuSystems, Inc., a private-equity backed healthcare company headquartered in Nashville.

Patient member numbers will continue to see exponential growth in the first half of 2018 due in large part to new partnerships with two large academic medical centers.\nAbout CarePayment\nCarePayment is a patient financial engagement company that accelerates providers' transition to the new consumer-driven healthcare market.
