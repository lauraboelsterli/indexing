    "text": "ALBANY, Ore., Willamette Community Bank (\"WCB\" or the \"Bank\"), one of Western Oregon's finest small community banks, today announced the appointment of Joan Reukauf as its new President and Chief Executive Officer. Ms. Reukauf has previously served as WCB's Interim Chief Executive Officer, has been an executive with the Bank since 2010 and has served as Senior Vice President and Chief Operations Officer since 2013. She succeeds departing CEO Daniel McDowell, who has announced his intention to resign for personal reasons.\nKerry Johnson, Chair of Willamette Community Bank's Board of Directors, stated that \"We are honored and delighted that Joan has agreed to lead WCB into the next chapter of its remarkable story.\" She continued, \"Joan is one of the Willamette Valley's best-known young business leaders, and we are confident that she is the right person to help us continue to grow, achieve a more efficient cost structure, and above all, broaden our customer appeal by enhancing our client experience and expanding our loan operations.\" The change is to be effective immediately.\nMs. Reukauf said that \"Working for WCB for the last eight years has been a privilege. I am looking forward to leading this great company and continuing to build its legacy in the community. Community banking is about helping communities grow and WCB leads that effort with an extraordinary staff of people in each of our branches. I am thrilled to continue this company's path into the future and to work closely with our customers and our shareholders.\"\nIn the near term Ms. Reukauf will serve in an interim role pending the receipt of the required bank regulatory approvals; however, Ms. Johnson indicated that \"We expect these approvals to be received in due course, and we anticipate that Joan will continue to lead the bank into a bright future as we refine and continue executing our growth strategy.\"\nAbout Willamette Community Bank\nWillamette Community Bank ( http://www.willamettecommunitybank.com ) is an Oregon chartered commercial bank headquartered in Albany, Oregon, with branches in nearby Salem and Lebanon.
