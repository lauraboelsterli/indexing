    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday denied the existence of a man portrayed in a sketch released by porn star Stormy Daniels, who said he warned her to stop discussing claims she had a sexual encounter with Trump.\nAdult-film actress Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, arrives at ABC studios to appear on The View talk show in New York City, New York, U.S. April 17, 2018. REUTERS/Mike Segar Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, says she had sex with Trump in 2006 and is fighting a 2016 non-disclosure agreement arranged by Trump’s personal attorney, in which she was paid $130,000 to keep silent.\nOn Tuesday, she and her attorney, Michael Avenatti, released a sketch of a man whom she said had threatened her in 2011, and offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to his identification.\nAvenatti announced on Wednesday the reward had been increased to $131,000.\nTrump has largely remained quiet on the subject, although he told reporters earlier this month that he did not know about the payment to Daniels.\nHowever, on Wednesday, in his first reference to Daniels via Twitter, he said in a post: “A sketch years later about a nonexistent man. A total con job, playing the Fake News Media for Fools (but they know it)!”\nAsked for comment, Avenatti referred to his own Twitter posts on Wednesday: “In my experience, there is nothing better in litigation than having a completely unhinged, undisciplined opponent who is prone to shooting himself in the foot. Always leads to BIGLY problems…like new claims (i.e. defamation).”\nTrump’s lawyers are seeking at least $20 million in damages from Daniels for violations of the non-disclosure agreement.\nReporting by Makini Brice; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ",
