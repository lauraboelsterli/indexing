    "text": "ACTON, Mass., April 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Psychemedics Corporation (NASDAQ:PMD) today announced first quarter financial results for the period ended March 31, 2018. The Company also announced a quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share payable to shareholders of record as of May 8, 2018, to be paid on May 18, 2018. This will be the Company’s 87 th consecutive quarterly dividend.\nThe Company’s revenue 2018 was $10.9 million versus $10.2 million 2017, an increase of 7%. Net income 2018 was $1.3 million or $0.23 per diluted share, versus $1.5 million or $0.27 per diluted share, for the comparable period last year, a decrease of 17%.\nRaymond C. Kubacki, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said,\n\"First Quarter revenues were a record for any 1Q in the Company's history. Our domestic revenues showed a very healthy pick up, increasing 13%. We saw significant strength in our Transportation, Oil and Gas, and Distributor market segments. Our Brazil business remains healthy and we continue to have a strong market share in the Brazil market, which represents a very large opportunity for our Company.\n\"Earnings continue to be healthy but were negatively impacted by increased auditing and accounting fees required by our becoming an accelerated filer and added sales taxes and expenses associated with establishing and operating our Brazil subsidiary (which was not in place in 1Q 2017 but represents an important long-term factor). Nonetheless, we still showed an 18% pre-tax margin.\n\"While the Company’s tax rate had a small increase from 33% to 35%, this reflects the inclusion of Brazilian income taxes (not present in Q1 2017), partially offset by a reduction in the U.S. federal income tax rate.\n\"We are encouraged by the continuing strength and momentum in our domestic business and also look forward to the expansion of the Brazil market this September when professional drivers are required to renew their licenses every 2 1/2 years instead of the current 5 years. This is expansion by law and would virtually double the market size as it unfolds.\n“The Company’s balance sheet remains strong with $8.3 million in cash and $10.4 million of working capital. The total equipment financing obligation outstanding was $3.1 million as of March 31, 2018. Our directors share our confidence in the future of Psychemedics and remain committed to rewarding shareholders and sharing the financial success of the Company with them as we grow. Therefore, we are pleased to increase the quarterly dividend from $0.15 to $0.18 per share, an increase of 20%. This dividend represents our 87th consecutive quarterly dividend.”\nContact:\nNeil Lerner\nVice President of Finance\n(978) 206-8220\nNeill@psychemedics.com\nPsychemedics Corporation is the world’s largest provider of hair testing for the detection of drugs of abuse.
