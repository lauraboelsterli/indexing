China's State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attends a news conference at the Government Guesthouse in Hanoi, Vietnam April 1, 2018. REUTERS/Kham \nChina will unveil new measures on reform and opening up at the annual forum, Wang told a news briefing in Beijing. The forum will be held in China’s southern island province of Hainan, from April 8 to 11. \nChinese leaders have pledged to roll out fresh market-opening measures this year, which marks the 40th anniversary of China’s landmark economic reforms and opening up under former leader Deng Xiaoping. \nPresident Xi will make “the most authoritative interpretation” on reforms and opening up, Wang said. \n“People will hear a series of new important measures on reforms and opening up,” he said. \nForeign leaders including Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi will attend the forum, known as Asia’s Davos, Wang said.
