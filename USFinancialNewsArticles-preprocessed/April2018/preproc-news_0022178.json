    "text": "AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) has asked it to rule on whether it has jurisdiction over the deportations of Rohingya people from Myanmar to Bangladesh, a possible crime against humanity, according to a filing published on Monday.\nRohingya refugee child looks through the fence at a refugee camp in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh March 22, 2018. REUTERS/Mohammad Ponir Hossain A ruling affirming jurisdiction could pave the way for Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda to investigate the deportation of many thousands of Rohingya, though Myanmar is unlikely to cooperate.\n“This is not an abstract question but a concrete one, affecting whether the Court may exercise jurisdiction ... to investigate and, if necessary, prosecute,” Bensouda said in the filing.\nThe main reason for doubt over jurisdiction is that, while Bangladesh is a member of the court, Myanmar is not.\nBensouda argued that, given the cross-border nature of the crime of deportation, a ruling in favour of ICC jurisdiction would be in line with established legal principles.\nBut she acknowledged uncertainty around the definition of the crime of deportation and limits of the court’s jurisdiction.\nHer request is the first of its kind filed at the court. She asked the court to call a hearing to hear her arguments, as well as those of other interested parties.\nThe magistrate assigned to consider the request, Congolese judge Antoine Kesia-Mbe Mindua, will have considerable leeway in determining how to proceed.\nAccording to the United Nations, some 700,000 mostly Muslim Rohingya fled their homes into Bangladesh after militant attacks in August last year triggered a military crackdown that the United Nations has said constitutes ethnic cleansing.\nBuddhist-majority Myanmar rejects that charge, saying its forces have been waging a legitimate campaign against Rohingya who attacked government forces. Many in Myanmar regard the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.\nReporting by Toby Sterling; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ",
