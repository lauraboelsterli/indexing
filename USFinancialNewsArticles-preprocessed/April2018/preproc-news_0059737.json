REUTERS/Kirill Kudryavtsev/Pool\nWashington imposed sweeping sanctions on some of Russia’s biggest companies and businessmen on April 6, striking at allies of President Vladimir Putin to punish Moscow for its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and other so-called malign activities.\nAsked about a proposal drafted by Russia’s lower house of parliament to criminalise observance of U.S. sanctions, Medvedev said the restrictions were aimed at destroying Russia’s socio-political system and harming the economy and individuals.\n“If this is so, then the implementation of these sanctions by citizens of our country should be an offence. No one should have the right to observe these American sanctions for fear of having to take administrative or criminal liability,” he said.
