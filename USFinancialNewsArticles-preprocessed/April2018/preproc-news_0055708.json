    "text": "HOUSTON, April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nCBTX, Inc. (the “Company”) (NASDAQ:CBTX), the bank holding company for CommunityBank of Texas N.A., today announced net income of $9.1 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $6.9 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 and $2.0 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nHighlights\nLoans increased $44.5 million during the first quarter of 2018, an 8% annualized growth rate for the quarter.\nNet interest income increased $3.2 million or 12.4%, from the first of quarter 2017 to the first quarter of 2018, primarily due increased average loans and yields on loans.\nIncome tax expense decreased $893,000 from the first quarter 2017 to the first quarter of 2018 and $4.2 million from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018 due to the reduction of the federal tax rate from 35% to 21% and a fourth quarter 2017 charge of $3.9 million related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\").\nOperating Results:\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income was $29.0 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $25.8 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $28.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in net interest income in the first quarter of 2018 from the first quarter of 2017, was due to increased average loans and repayment of our note payable in the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased average yields on loans and federal funds sold. The increase in net interest income in the first quarter of 2018 from the fourth quarter of 2017 was due to increased average loans and average loan yields and the impact of the repayment of our note payable.\nThe yield on interest-earning assets was 4.49% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 4.26% for the first quarter of 2017 and 4.29% for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe cost of interest-bearing liabilities, including borrowings, was 0.55% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 0.57% for the first quarter of 2017 and 0.56% for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe net interest margin was 4.19% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 3.93% for the first quarter of 2017 and 3.98% for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nProvision (Recapture) for Loan Losses\nProvision for loan loss was $865,000 for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $960,000 for the first quarter of 2017 and $1.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe allowance for loan losses was $25.3 million, or 1.08% of total loans, at March 31, 2018, compared to $25.9 million, or 1.17% of total loans, at March 31, 2017 and $24.8 million, or 1.07% of total loans, at December 31, 2017.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income was $3.4 million for the first quarter of 2018, $3.4 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $3.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Although noninterest income was flat between the first quarter 2018 and the first quarter 2017, there was a decrease in gains on sales of assets and an increase in bank-owned life insurance income from the first quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018. The increase in noninterest income from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to higher gains on sales of loans in the first quarter of 2018.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense increased $1.9 million during the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2017 and decreased $1.7 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe decrease in noninterest expense during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 is due primarily to a $2.5 million charge for change of control payments to certain employees triggered by our initial public offering, which is reflected in salaries and employee benefits and increased professional and director fees in the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the $2.5 million charge for change of control payments, noninterest expense for the first quarter of 2018 increased $795,000 primarily due to increased salaries and employee benefits due to increases in salaries and incentive compensation and health insurance premiums, partially offset by lower professional and director fees.\nThe increase in noninterest expense in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 is primarily due to increased salaries and employee benefits due to increases in salaries and incentive compensation, health insurance premiums and stock compensation expense.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense was $2.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, $3.0 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $6.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a deferred tax asset impairment charge of $3.9 million related to the recent Tax Act.\nThe effective tax rates were 19.0% for the first quarter of 2018, 30.7% for the first quarter of 2017 and 76.3% for the fourth quarter of 2017. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 reflects reduction of the federal tax rate from 35% to 21% in the recent Tax Act.\nBalance Sheet Highlights :\nLoans\nLoans were $2.4 billion at March 31, 2018, $2.2 billion at March 31, 2017 and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2017. The increases from the prior year and linked quarter are primarily due to organic growth.\nAsset Quality\nNonperforming assets remain low relative to total assets at $6.1 million, or 0.20% of total assets, at March 31, 2018, $7.2 million, or 0.25% of total assets, at March 31, 2017 and $8.4 million, or 0.27% of total assets at December 31, 2017.\nNonperforming loans were $5.8 million, or 0.24% of total loans, at March 31, 2018, $6.1 million, or 0.27% of total loans, at March 31, 2017 and $7.6 million, or 0.33% of total loans, at December 31, 2017.\nAnnualized net charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans were 0.05% for the first quarter of 2018, 0.02% for the first quarter of 2017 and 0.00% for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nDeposits and Borrowings\nTotal deposits were $2.6 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $2.5 billion at March 31, 2017 and $2.6 billion at December 31, 2017.\nTotal borrowings (excluding junior subordinated debentures) were $861,000 at March 31, 2018, $29.0 million at March 31, 2017 and $1.5 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease in borrowings is due to scheduled payments and our fourth quarter repayment in full of the outstanding balance of our note payable. On December 13, 2017, we entered into a loan agreement providing for a $30 million revolving line of credit and from that date through March 31, 2018, we made no borrowings under that agreement.\nCapital\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company remains well capitalized. Our ratio of total shareholders’ equity to total assets was 14.69% and our tangible equity to total tangible assets was 12.19% at March 31, 2018 and our ratio of total shareholders’ equity to total assets was 12.48% and our tangible equity to total tangible assets was 9.74% at March 31, 2017. Tangible equity to total tangible assets is a non‑GAAP financial measure. See the table captioned “Non‑GAAP to GAAP Reconciliation.”\nIn November 2017, we completed our initial public offering of our common stock issuing 2,760,000 common shares at $26.00 per share and net proceeds of $64.5 million, which is the primary cause of the increase in these ratios.\nAbout CBTX, Inc.\nCBTX, Inc. is the bank holding company for CommunityBank of Texas, N.A., a $3.1 billion asset bank, offering commercial banking solutions to local small and mid-sized businesses and professionals in Houston, Beaumont and surrounding communities in southeast Texas.

Forward-looking statements include information regarding the Company’s future financial performance, business and growth strategy, projected plans and objectives, as well as projections of macroeconomic and industry trends, which are inherently unreliable due to the multiple factors that impact economic trends, and any such variations may be material. Statements preceded by, followed by or that otherwise include the words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “projects,” “estimates,” “plans” and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “should,” “would,” “may” and “could” are generally forward-looking in nature and not historical facts, although not all forward-looking statements include the foregoing. Further, certain factors that could affect our future results and cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to whether the Company can: prudently manage and execute its growth strategy; manage risks associated with its acquisition and de novo branching strategy; maintain its asset quality; address the volatility and direction of market interest rates; continue to have access to debt and equity capital markets; and achieve its performance goals. The foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read together with the other cautionary statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (‘SEC”) and other reports and statements that the Company has filed with the SEC. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if the Company’s underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from what its anticipates. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and the Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for the Company to predict which will arise. In addition, the Company cannot assess the impact of each factor on its business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

AND SUBSIDIARY\nNon‑GAAP to GAAP Reconciliation (Unaudited)\n(In thousands, except per share data and percentages)\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and the prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, we also evaluate our performance based on certain additional non‑GAAP financial measures. We classify a financial measure as being a non‑GAAP financial measure if that financial measure excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding or including amounts, that are not included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP as in effect from time to time in the United States in our statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows. Non‑GAAP financial measures do not include operating and other statistical measures or ratios or statistical measures calculated using exclusively financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non‑GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable or other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the way we calculate the non‑GAAP financial measures may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names.\nWe calculate (1) tangible equity as total shareholders’ equity, less goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, and (2) tangible book value per share as tangible equity divided by shares of common stock outstanding at the end of the relevant period. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for tangible book value per share is book value per share. We calculate tangible assets as total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for tangible equity to tangible assets is total shareholders’ equity to total assets. We believe that tangible book value per share and tangible equity to tangible assets are measures that are important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in book value per share and total shareholders’ equity to total assets, exclusive of change in intangible assets.\nThe following tables reconcile, as of the dates set forth below, total shareholders’ equity to tangible equity, total assets to tangible assets and presents book value per share, tangible book value per share, tangible equity to tangible assets and shareholders’ equity to total assets:\n3/31/2018 12/31/2017 9/30/2017 6/30/2017 3/31/2017 Tangible Equity Total shareholders’ equity $ 451,571 $ 446,214 $ 381,121 $ 371,964 $ 363,643 Adjustments: Goodwill 80,950 80,950 80,950 80,950 80,950 Other intangibles 6,521 6,770 7,031 7,298 7,513 Tangible equity $ 364,100 $ 358,494 $ 293,140 $ 283,716 $ 275,180 Tangible Assets Total assets $ 3,074,790 $ 3,081,083 $ 2,989,838 $ 2,940,877 $ 2,914,548 Adjustments: Goodwill 80,950 80,950 80,950 80,950 80,950 Other intangibles 6,521 6,770 7,031 7,298 7,513 Tangible assets $ 2,987,319 $ 2,993,363 $ 2,901,857 $ 2,852,629 $ 2,826,085 Common shares outstanding 24,833 24,833 22,063 22,063 22,062 Book value per share $ 18.18 $ 17.97 $ 17.27 $ 16.86 $ 16.48 Tangible book value per share $ 14.66 $ 14.44 $ 13.29 $ 12.86 $ 12.47 Total shareholders’ equity to total assets 14.69 % 14.48 % 12.75 % 12.65 % 12.48 % Tangible equity to tangible assets 12.19 % 11.98 % 10.10 % 9.95 % 9.74 % Investor Relations: James L.
