    "text": "ROSELAND, N.J., April 18, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nWHAT: ADP ® will release its quarterly Workforce Vitality Report (WVR) with deeper labor market insights on Wednesday, April 25, 2018.\nEstablished in October 2014, the WVR offers an in-depth analysis of the vitality of the U.S. labor market based on data that identifies labor market trends and dynamics across multiple dimensions, including employment growth, wage growth and hours worked. Importantly, the WVR also distinguishes between job holders, job switchers and new entrants, which is key to understanding the health of the labor market. In addition to the macro data presented in the report, there are also segment-specific findings by industry, state, gender, age, experience and pay level.\nThe updated WVR from the ADP Research Institute ® will include all of the same segment-specific data, but also include updates to provide improved, more granular insights.\nEnhancements to the report will include the use of monthly data, rather than quarterly numbers, to sharpen labor market picture, the addition of information around new entrants to the workforce and deeper insights into seasonality and employment by firm size.\nDetailed information about changes to the methodology and an updated calendar of release dates will be available at http://workforcereport.adp.com/ on Wednesday, April 25.\nWVR data dating back to 2014, with the new methodology, will be available.\nWHEN: Wednesday, April 25, 2018\nABOUT ADP (NASDAQ: ADP) :\nPowerful technology plus a human touch.
