The sector has quickly asserted itself as a multi-billion dollar space both globally and abroad with advancing legalization and with the growth has come a variety of new niches for companies to play in. A recent study by New Frontier Data illustrates the potential for $132 billion in tax revenues when it comes to legal cannabis, displaying just how formidable the industry figures to be in coming years. Companies are capitalizing on this swelling market through product diversification as previously mentioned, as well as expansion into new markets. Active companies today include: Body and Mind Inc.
