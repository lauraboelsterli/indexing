    "text": " 15 AM / a few seconds ago Drug retailer Rite Aid's revenue misses estimates Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Drug retailer Rite Aid ( RAD.N ), which is being bought by U.S. grocer Albertsons Cos Inc, posted smaller-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue, hurt by a decline in reimbursement rates and prescription volumes. FILE PHOTO: A sign marks a Rite Aid pharmacy in Somerville, Massachusetts, U.S., June 29, 2017. REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo \nRevenue fell to $5.39 billion from $5.90 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $5.57 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nThe company posted net loss from continuing operations of $483.7 million, or 46 cents per share, for the quarter ended March 3, compared with a loss of $25.1 million, or 2 cents per share, a year earlier. \nThe loss includes $325 million of income tax expense related mainly to the revaluation of the companyâ€™s deferred tax assets in connection with the new U.S. tax law. \nExcluding one-time items, Rite Aid reported a loss of 1 cent per share.
