    "text": "Highlights\nNet income of $4.1 million for the first quarter of 2018 Diluted earnings per share of $0.58 for the first quarter of 2018 Book value per share of $20.17 as of March 31, 2018, an increase of $1.11, or 5.8%, since March 31, 2017 Tangible book value per share of $19.29 as of March 31, 2018, an increase of $1.19, or 6.6%, since March 31, 2017 Loan growth of $15.6 million during the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 1.4% Deposit growth of $62.3 million during the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 5.6%\nMANITOWOC, Wis., County Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq:ICBK), the holding company of Investors Community Bank, an agricultural and commercial bank headquartered in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, reported net income of $4.1 million, or $0.58 diluted earnings per share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to net income of $2.6 million, or $0.38 diluted earnings per share, for the first quarter of 2017. This represents a return on average assets of 1.15% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to 0.85% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Net income for the first quarter of 2018 was positively impacted by loan growth, as well as a recovery on a previously charged off commercial loan which resulted in a reduction in the provision for loan losses. The reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate also had a positive impact on net income.\n“Historically the first quarter has been a more modest one for loan growth, and 2018 was no different. That being said, our pipelines for both commercial and agriculture loans remain strong,” stated Timothy J. Schneider, President of County Bancorp, Inc. and CEO of Investors Community Bank. “After seeing solid core deposit growth in the fourth quarter of 2017, the first quarter saw a slight retraction. The core deposit gathering strategies we put into place in 2017 and continue in 2018 are still expected to show improvement for the balance of the year.”\nHe added, “The Company earned solid net income and earnings per share in the first quarter of 2018, much of which was due to the large recovery on a commercial loan discussed further below. This recovery resulted in a lower loan loss provision for the quarter, which offset some of the additional migration of loans into nonperforming assets. The dairy sector in general continues to feel the stress of three years of lower milk prices. We continue to work through this dairy cycle with our clients and have recently seen some improvement in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange milk price futures for the balance of 2018 and into 2019.”\nLoans and Total Assets\nTotal assets at March 31, 2018 were $1.5 billion, an increase of $63.2 million, or 4.5%, and $208.8 million, or 16.7%, over total assets as of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively. Total loans were $1.2 billion at March 31, 2018, which represents a $15.6 million, or 1.4%, and $115.5 million, or 11.0%, increase over total loans at December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively. For the first quarter 2018, we continued to see solid loan demand in all of our market areas.\nIn addition to the on-balance sheet loan growth, participated loans that we continue to service totaled $611.4 million at March 31, 2018, which is an increase of $10.7 million, or 1.8%, and $29.7 million, or 5.1%, over December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively.\nDeposits\nTotal deposits at March 31, 2018 were $1.2 billion, an increase of $62.3 million, or 5.6%, and $191.1 million, or 19.5%, over total deposits as of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively. Core deposit (demand deposits, money markets, and certificates of deposit) generation remained challenging, showing a decrease of $11.9 million during the first quarter of 2018 due to normal cyclical trends related to agricultural and municipal deposits. We continue to supplement our deposit needs with wholesale deposits, which include brokered deposits and national certificates of deposit. Brokered deposits and national certificates of deposit at March 31, 2018 were $502.8 million, which was an increase of $77.8 million, or 18.3%, from December 31, 2017, and an increase of $139.6 million, or 38.4%, from March 31, 2017.\nNet Interest Income and Margin\nNet interest income improved slightly to $10.3 million for three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $10.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, net interest income increased to $10.3 million from $9.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to loan growth.\nNet interest margin decreased to 3.01% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to 3.06% for the three months ended December 31, 2017. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the net interest margin of 3.01% decreased from 3.07% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decline reflected the impact of costs related to deposits and borrowings increasing more than the yields on loans and investments. Yields on interest bearing assets increased by 0.25% between the first quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018 while the costs of interest bearing liabilities increased by 0.35%.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company executed an interest rate swap on two sets of its trust preferred floating rate securities. The swaps converted the interest rate paid on one set of trust preferred securities from a floating rate, reset quarterly, of three month LIBOR plus 1.53% (currently 3.65%) to a fixed rate of 4.354% and for the other set, from a floating rate of three month LIBOR plus 1.69% (currently 3.81%) to a fixed rate of 4.514%. Both swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting under ASC 815-20-25-3, so any market value adjustments will be marked to market through accumulated other comprehensive income, assuming the hedge remains highly effective through the life of the swaps. The swaps will commence June 15, 2018 and will mature on June 15, 2028.\nNon-Interest Income and Expense\nNon-interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was unchanged at $2.0 million compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nNon-interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased $0.3 million to $2.0 million compared to $1.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increase is directly related to increases in loan servicing rights which was the result of higher volumes of loans being serviced.\nNon-interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 decreased by $0.4 million to $6.8 million compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017. While employee compensation and benefits increased by $0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017, non-interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was higher by $0.4 million compared to the three months ended March 31, 2018 primarily due to business development expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 which were accelerated from future periods to maximize the tax advantage of the higher corporate tax rate in 2017 and the write-down of an OREO property of $0.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNon-interest expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased $0.9 million to $6.8 million from $5.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increase is primarily related to the recognition of a gain on the sale of an OREO property of $0.4 million included for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, which helped offset expenses during the same period. Small increases quarter-over-quarter were seen in employee compensation and benefits and information processing expenses.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $1.4 million compared to $2.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was signed into law. Among other changes was a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the Company decreased the value of its net deferred tax asset by $0.9 million, which was included in income tax expense for the three months ended December 31, 2017. The additional variance in income tax expense was caused by the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate.\nIncome tax expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 decreased to $1.4 million compared to $1.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 due the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate.\nAsset Quality\nNon-performing assets as a percent of total assets increased to 1.83% at March 31, 2018, from 1.15% at December 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, non-performing assets were $26.7 million, up from $16.1 million at December 31, 2017. Non-performing loans increased $6.1 million from one relationship being put on non-accrual status and three properties were transferred from non-accrual status into OREO for an increase of $4.4 million in OREO during the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company recorded net recoveries of $1.3 million compared to net charge offs of $0.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017. A recovery of $1.2 million was recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2018 on a multi-family real estate loan, acquired in 2016 as part of the Fox River Valley acquisition.\nA provision for loan losses of $0.1 million was recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as a result of a $1.4 impairment on an agricultural relationship that partially offset the net recovery mentioned above. For the three months ended December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, the provision for loan losses was $12 thousand and $0.8 million, respectively.\nAbout County Bancorp, Inc.\nCounty Bancorp, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation and registered bank holding company founded in May 1996, and our wholly-owned subsidiary Investors Community Bank, a Wisconsin-chartered bank, are headquartered in Manitowoc, Wisconsin.
