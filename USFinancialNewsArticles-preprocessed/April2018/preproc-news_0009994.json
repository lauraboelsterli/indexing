    "text": "Daniel Descalso, David Peralta and John Ryan Murphy all homered, and the Arizona Diamondbacks handed Clayton Kershaw his second straight loss with a 6-1 victory over the visiting Los Angeles Dodgers on Tuesday at Chase Field.\nRight-hander Zack Godley tossed seven strong innings as Arizona won for the fourth time in five games to start the season.\nLeft-handed hitters Descalso and Peralta hit their homers off the left-handed Kershaw, and Murphy homered in the eighth to complete the scoring.\nGodley (1-0) gave up one run and four hits while outdueling Kershaw. He struck out three and walked one and departed after 96 pitches.\nRight-hander Yoshihisa Hirano pitched a perfect eighth inning and left-hander T.J. McFarland worked a flawless ninth, striking out Matt Kemp to end the contest.\nKershaw (0-2) struck out six in six innings and allowed two runs, four hits and one walk. He has allowed three runs in his two starts this season, all on solo homers.\nPeralta and Murphy each had two hits for Arizona, which had eight overall.\nDescalso smacked a one-out solo homer well over the fence in right-center field to get the Diamondbacks on the board in the second inning.\nThe Dodgers tied the score in the third as Austin Barnes hit a leadoff double to left and moved around on two fly balls with Chris Taylor’s drive to center bringing in the run.\nPeralta lined a one-out shot over the fence in right in the third to give Arizona a 2-1 lead.\nThe Diamondbacks loaded the bases with no out in the seventh against Los Angeles left-hander Scott Alexander. After Peralta struck out, Ketel Marte coaxed a walk in a 10-pitch at-bat to force in Deven Marrero and make it 3-1.\nRight-hander Pedro Baez entered and walked Paul Goldschmidt and A.J. Pollock to force in two more runs.\nMurphy added a solo blast in the eighth when he sent an offering from right-hander Zach Neal over the fence in left.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
