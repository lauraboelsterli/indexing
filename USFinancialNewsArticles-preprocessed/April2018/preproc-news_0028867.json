FILE PHOTO: Tennis - France versus Great Britain - Davis Cup Quarter Final - Kindarena, Rouen, France - 7/4/17 Great Britain's Dan Evans in action against France's Jeremy Chardy during his Quarter Final Reuters / Gonzalo Fuentes \nThe 27-year-old, who tested positive for cocaine during the Barcelona Open last year, is eligible to return for the tournament starting April 28. \n“I want to thank everyone who has supported me throughout this difficult period,” Evans, the former world number 41, said in a statement. \n“I have learned a lot about myself in my time away from the game, a sport that I love very dearly. I am now committed to training hard, resuming my career and getting back to where I was, although appreciate this will take time.” \nEvans was handed a wildcard by the LTA after he passed the “agreed checks” over the last six weeks. \n“(Dan) has begun to support the development of the LTA’s anti-doping education materials to help emerging young players avoid similar mistakes,” LTA performance director Simon Timson said.
