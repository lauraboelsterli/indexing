    "text": "April 30 (Reuters) - AMP announced the resignation of Chairwoman Catherine Brenner on Monday, the second senior executive at the Australian wealth manager to exit after damaging revelations at a judicial inquiry into the country’s financial sector of serious misconduct at the firm.\nThe country’s largest listed wealth manager said in a statement that Brenner would depart immediately, adding the board would cut all directors’ fees for the rest of calendar year 2018 by a quarter.\nBrenner would be replaced by Mike Wilkins, who has been appointed executive chairman until a new chair is appointed on a permanent basis.
