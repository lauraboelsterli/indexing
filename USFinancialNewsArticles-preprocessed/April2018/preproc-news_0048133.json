    "text": "HONG KONG (Reuters) - Ping An Healthcare and Technology Co Ltd, a unit of Ping An Insurance (Group) Co of China Ltd ( 2318.HK ) ( 601318.SS ), plans to raise up to HK$8.77 billion ($1.1 billion) in a Hong Kong initial public offering to help expand its e-commerce business.\nThe unit, also known as Ping An Good Doctor, plans to sell a total of 160.09 million shares at up to HK$54.80 apiece, it said in a filing to the Hong Kong bourse on Monday.\nIn January, Reuters reported that Ping An Insurance had raised nearly $1 billion for a medical data collection and analysis business ahead of a Hong Kong IPO.\nThe operator of China’s largest internet healthcare platform, in terms of users and daily online consultations, said proceeds from the IPO would also be used to fund acquisitions and strategic alliances as well as for research.\nThe price will be fixed on April 26 and dealing in the shares is expected to begin on May 4.\nCiti and J.P. Morgan are the joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners of the issue.\nPing An Healthcare was close to securing cornerstone investors for its IPO, including Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC, Malaysia’s sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional, and U.S. asset manager BlackRock, Reuters’ publication IFR reported, citing people familiar with the situation.\nPing An Healthcare, in which Ping An Insurance will hold 39.27 percent on completion of the global offering, delivers on-demand healthcare through its mobile platform, including online family doctors, healthcare and health mall services.\nIt has established a nationwide network of healthcare service providers covering 3,100 hospitals, 1,100 health check-up centres, 500 dental clinics and 7,500 pharmacy outlets.\nUnderlying strong demand for the issue has provided solid support to the Hong Kong dollar, pushing the currency up to 7.8425 per U.S. dollar, its strongest in five weeks.\nReporting by Donny Kwok; Editing by Stephen Coates\n 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
