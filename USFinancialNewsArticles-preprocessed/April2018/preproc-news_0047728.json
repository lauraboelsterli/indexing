These statements include, but are not limited to, any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance, achievements or events. Forward-looking statements can generally be identified by phrases such as \"believes,\" \"expects,\" \"potential,\" \"continues,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"seeks,\" \"predicts,\" \"anticipates,\" \"intends,\" \"projects,\" \"estimates,\" \"plans,\" \"could,\" \"designed\", \"should be,\" and other similar expressions that denote expectations of future or conditional events rather than statements of fact. Forward-looking statements also may relate to strategies, plans and objectives for, and potential results of, future operations, financial results, financial condition, business prospects, growth strategy and liquidity, and are based upon financial data, market assumptions and management's current business plans and beliefs or current estimates of future results or trends available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out of date or incomplete.
