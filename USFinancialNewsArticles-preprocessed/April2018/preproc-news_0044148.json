    "text": "Published: Apr 19, 2018 8:15 a.m. ET Share \nOpenAP membership can cost up to $10 million over five years Getty Images One of NBCU’s products matches marketer data to TV viewership data – from Comcast and other sources -- so advertisers can identify which shows capture viewers that look most like their customers. \nBy Alexandra Bruell \nComcast Corp.’s NBCUniversal CMCSA, +0.74% has been reluctant to support OpenAP, a TV audience targeting concept from a consortium of TV networks, instead touting its own data and targeting efforts. \nNow, the media company is changing its tune. ‘[The goal is to] build a significantly more accelerated advanced ad business for all TV programmers. We felt that our capabilities, plus the fact that there’s a consortium of three other media companies, helps us do that collectively and more effectively than any of the independent companies.’ Krishan Bhatia, executive vice president of business operations and strategy at NBCUniversal \nNBCU is joining rivals Viacom Inc. VIA, -0.56% , Turner TWX, -0.50% and Fox FOX, -0.27% in their effort to advance TV ad targeting, the company said. \nViacom, Turner and Fox joined forces over a year ago to start building OpenAP, a system intended to standardize the precise categories ad buyers can purchase in TV. That way, an advertiser who wants to reach people in the market for a minivan doesn’t have to deal with different data approaches at different networks when trying to identify which shows best reach their audience. \nThe OpenAP consortium is asking media companies to pay $2.5 million for an “equity” membership, which includes a board seat, in addition to $1.5 million a year with a five-year commitment, according to people familiar with the matter. Altogether, that’s a $10 million buy-in. A membership that does not include a board seat still costs up to $1.5 million a year. ",
