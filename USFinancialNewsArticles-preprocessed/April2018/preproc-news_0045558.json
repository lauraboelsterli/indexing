Sources of economic and industry information include: Colliers International, Keegan & Coppin Company, Inc., ycharts/housing, State of California Employment Development Department, US Census, CBRE, Integra Realty Resources, and Sacramento Association of Realtors and Trading Economics.\nCommercial real estate and employment data continued to be positive in the markets we serve.\nCommercial Real Estate. In the Greater Sacramento Area, when comparing fourth quarter 2017 to fourth quarter 2016, commercial real estate vacancies improved in all segments. Office vacancy decreased from 11.6% to 10.8%, retail vacancy decreased from 10.3% to 9.1%, and industrial vacancy decreased from 8.1% to 5.9%. In Sonoma County, for the same period (fourth quarter 2017 compared to fourth quarter 2016), commercial real estate vacancies also continued to improve. Office vacancy decreased from 14.7% to 12.5%, retail vacancy remained flat at 3.8%, and industrial vacancy decreased from 5.8% to 4.6%.\nIn all segments (office, retail, and industrial), the Greater Sacramento Area reported positive absorption over the past three years, with the exception of first quarter 2016 (retail and office). Sonoma County and the City of Santa Rosa has reported (when data is available) positive absorption over the past three years for the office and industrial segments (retail data is not available).\nIn Greater Sacramento, commercial lease rates have been in a relatively narrow range over the past two years through the fourth quarter 2017 with lease rates ranging from the following: office: $1.71/SF to $1.83/SF; retail: $1.33/SF to $1.36/SF and industrial: $0.46/SF to $0.50/SF. At March 31, 2018, lease rates per square foot were $1.83 for office, $1.34 for retail, and $0.50 for industrial.\nAs a proxy for Sonoma County, the City of Santa Rosa’s gross office lease rates in fourth quarter 2015 averaged $1.75/SF and industrial rates averaged $0.80/SF.

There was no retail rental rate data available for Santa Rosa for this time period. Lease rate data for office and industrial for year-end 2017 has not yet been made available.\nThe Amador region has the lowest level of commercial real estate concentration in the Bank. There is limited supply for commercial real estate in this region and as a result, minimal information is available.\nMulti-family . The multi-family market in the Sacramento area has reflected high occupancy over the last two years. The highest occupancy rate within this time range was in second quarter 2016 at 97.9%, and the lowest was fourth quarter 2017 at 96.4%. Monthly lease rates during this period ranged from $1,157 in first quarter 2016 to $1,359 in fourth quarter 2017.\nThe trailing 12-month cap rate during the past two years ranged with minor fluctuation from 5.58% in first quarter 2016 to 6.10% in third quarter 2017.

There were 17.5 million employed at the end of 2014, 17.9 million employed at the end of 2015, and 18.2 million at the end of 2016. The State added another 353,000 jobs in 2017 bringing the total employed to 18.5 million at December 31, 2017.\nAt December 31, 2015, all three of our markets reported lower unemployment rates than at year end 2014. Unemployment rates at the time were 5.5% and 4.2% for the Sacramento MSA and Santa Rosa-Petaluma MSA, respectively. When comparing December 31, 2016 to December 31 2017, unemployment rates decreased from 5.0% to 3.8% in the Sacramento MSA and 3.7% to 2.8% in the Santa Rosa-Petaluma MSA. However, as of month-end February 2018 the rate for Sacramento and Santa Rosa-Petaluma MSAs increased to 4.3% and 3.0% respectively.\nOver the same period, Amador County has been higher than the State every quarter with the exception of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2017. Amador County had shown improvement from 7.4% at December 31, 2014 to 6.2% at December 31, 2015, and 5.9% at December 31, 2016.

The loan portfolio at March 31, 2018 included: real estate loans of $280.2 million (92% of the portfolio), commercial loans of $20.7 million (7% of the portfolio) and other loans, which consist mainly of leases and consumer loans of $2.8 million (1% of the portfolio). The real estate loan portfolio at March 31, 2018 includes: owner-occupied commercial real estate loans of $68.8 million (25% of the real estate portfolio), investor commercial real estate loans of $113.3 million (40% of the real estate portfolio), multi-family real estate loans of $76.3 million (27% of the real estate portfolio), construction and land development loans of $6.3 million (2% of the real estate portfolio) and residential real estate loans of $15.5 million (6% of the real estate loan portfolio).\nNonperforming assets (“NPAs”) include nonperforming loans, leases, and other assets and other real estate owned. Nonperforming loans includes all such loans and leases that are either placed on nonaccrual status or are 90 days past due as to principal or interest but still accrue interest because such loans are well-secured and in the process of collection. NPAs decreased to $2.8 million at March 31, 2018 from $2.9 million at December 31, 2017 and increased from $1.4 million at March 31, 2017. The NPAs to total assets ratio decreased to 0.41% at the end of March 2018 from 0.44% at December 31, 2017 and increased from 0.21% one year ago.\nAt March 31, 2018 and at December 31, 2017, the Company had one OREO property totaling $961,000. This compares to two OREO properties totaling $1.3 million at March 31, 2017. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company did not add, sell, or modify the value of any OREO properties. At March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2017 there was not a valuation allowance for OREO properties.\nLoans measured for impairment were $12.5 million at the end of March 2018, a decrease from $13.8 million at December 31, 2017, and $17.2 million a year ago. Specific reserves of $524,000 were held on the impaired loans at March 31, 2018, compared to $355,000 at December 31, 2017 and $533,000 at March 31, 2017. There was no provision for loan and lease losses added for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017. There was a provision for loan and lease losses of $150,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company had net recoveries of $10,000 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to net recoveries of $11,000 in the first quarter of 2017. The Company maintains the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level believed to be adequate for known and inherent risks in the portfolio. The methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations, both quantitative and qualitative, in establishing an allowance for loan and lease losses that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date. During 2013, the Company participated in a shared national credit to a large retailer. The Company’s initial loan balance of $3.0 million was paid down to $2.7 million, as agreed until the third quarter of 2017 when this retailer filed for bankruptcy reorganization and the loan was placed on nonaccrual status. The Company has performed an impairment analysis, which resulted in reducing the loan balance to $1.6 million as of March 31, 2018, through charge offs totaling $1.1 million to the allowance for loan and lease losses (“ALLL”). The loan also carries a $200,000 specific reserve reducing the Company’s exposure to $1.4 million. The Company continues to gather the latest information available to perform and update its impairment analysis. As more information becomes available, the Company will update the impairment analysis, which could lead to further charges to the ALLL. The Company maintains the ALLL at a level believed to be adequate for known and inherent risks in the portfolio. The methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations, both quantitative and qualitative, in establishing an allowance for loan and lease losses that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date.\nInvestment securities, which excludes $3.9 million in stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (“FHLB Stock”), totaled $288.8 million at March 31, 2018, up 9.9% from $262.7 million at December 31, 2017 and up 9.6% from $263.6 million at March 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, the investment portfolio was comprised of 89% U.S. Government agencies or U.S. Government-sponsored agencies (primarily mortgage-backed securities), 8% obligations of states and political subdivisions, 2% corporate bonds, and 1% U.S. Treasuries.\nAt March 31, 2018, total deposits were $600.2 million, compared to $556.1 million at December 31, 2017 and $551.0 million one year ago. Core deposits increased 11.0% to $520.4 million at March 31, 2018 from $468.8 million at March 31, 2017 and increased 9.2% from $476.4 million at December 31, 2017. The Company considers all deposits except time deposits as core deposits.\nAt March 31, 2018, noninterest-bearing demand deposits accounted for 35% of total deposits, interest-bearing demand accounts were 12%, savings deposits were 12%, money market balances accounted for 28% and time certificates were 13% of total deposits. At March 31, 2017, noninterest-bearing demand deposits accounted for 36% of total deposits, interest-bearing demand accounts were 12%, savings deposits were 12%, money market balances accounted for 25% and time certificates were 15% of total deposits.\nShareholders’ equity decreased $4.8 million (6.3%) to $72.1 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $76.9 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease in equity from December 31, 2017 was due to a decrease in common stock of $4.0 million primarily related to repurchases made under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program and a $1.9 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income related to an decrease in the unrealized gain on securities, partially offset by an increase in Retained Earnings of $1.0 million due to the net income for the quarter less cash dividends declared.\nNet Interest Income\nThe net interest income during the first quarter 2018 was $4.7 million (a decrease of 1.5%) compared to $4.8 million in the first quarter of 2017 and the net interest margin as a percentage of average earning assets was 3.29% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 3.39% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 3.44% in the first quarter of 2017. Interest income for the first quarter of 2018 remained consistent at $5.1 million (an increase of 0.3%) compared to the first quarter of 2017 and interest expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $329,000 (an increase of 36.0%) compared to $242,000 for the first quarter of 2017.\nThe average tax equivalent yield on earning assets decreased from 3.61% in the first quarter of 2017 to 3.51% for the first quarter of 2018. Much of the decrease in yields from the first quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018 can be attributed to a decrease in loans. When compared to the first quarter of 2017, average loan balances decreased $12.8 million (4.0%) from $320.1 million to $307.3 million for the first quarter of 2018.\nThe average balance of earning assets increased 2.2% from $579.2 million in the first quarter of 2017 to $591.9 million in the first quarter of 2018.\nAverage deposits increased $40.5 million (7.4%) from $545.9 million during the first quarter of 2017 to $586.4 million during the first quarter of 2018. Average borrowings remained consistent at $15.5 million during the first quarters of 2017 and 2018.\nNoninterest Income and Expense\nNoninterest income for the first quarter of 2018 decreased $47,000 (11.2%) to $372,000, compared to $419,000 in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in noninterest income was predominately related to a decrease in income from the gain on sale of securities from $56,000 in 2017 to $1,000 in 2018.\nNoninterest expense decreased $80,000 (2.3%), remaining consistent at $3.4 million for the first quarter of 2017 and 2018. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in other expenses of $81,000. Other expense includes costs such as insurance, director expenses, technology and telephone expenses, and bank charges. Also included was an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $36,000 offset by a decrease in OREO related expenses of $15,000 and a decrease in Occupancy and in Furniture and Equipment expenses totaling $20,000.\nThe fully taxable equivalent efficiency ratio for the first quarter of 2018 increased to 64.8% from 64.4% for the first quarter of 2017.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nFederal and state income taxes decreased $210,000 (34.1%) from $616,000 in the first quarter of 2017 to $406,000 in the first quarter of 2018. The lower provision for taxes in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily resulted from the lower federal tax rate effective January 1, 2018 of 21% compared to 34% in prior year. Income before taxes also decreased $41,000 from the first quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018.\nEarnings Conference Call\nThe first quarter earnings conference call will be held Thursday, April 19, 2018 at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time (4:30 p.m. Eastern Time).

Our honest approach, commitment to community and focus on profitability is intended to lead our clients to greater success. For more information, call (800) 544-0545 or visit AmericanRiverBank.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis news release contains certain non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) financial measures in addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures include tangible book value and taxable equivalent basis. Management has presented these non-GAAP financial measures in this earnings release because it believes that they provide useful and comparative information to assess trends in the Company’s financial position reflected in the current quarter and year-to-date results and facilitate comparison of our performance with the performance of our peers.\nNet Interest Margin and Efficiency Ratio (non-GAAP financial measures)\nIn accordance with industry standards, certain designated net interest income amounts are presented on a taxable equivalent basis, including the calculation of net interest margin and the efficiency ratio. The Company believes the presentation of net interest margin on a taxable equivalent basis using a 21% effective tax rate for 2018 and a 34% effective tax rate for 2017 allows for comparability of net interest margin with industry peers by eliminating the effect of the differences in portfolios attributable to the proportion represented by both taxable and tax-exempt loans and investments. The efficiency ratio is a measure of a banking company’s overhead as a percentage of its revenue. The Company derives this ratio by dividing total noninterest expense by the sum of the taxable equivalent net interest income and the total noninterest income.\nTangible Equity (non-GAAP financial measures)\nTangible common stockholders' equity (tangible book value) excludes goodwill and other intangible assets. The Company believes the exclusion of goodwill and other intangible assets to create “tangible equity” facilitates the comparison of results for ongoing business operations. The Company’s management internally assesses its performance based, in part, on these non-GAAP financial measures.\nAdjustments made to reflect certain expenses\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded expenses related to a change in leadership as well as higher than historical income tax expense resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on December 31, 2017. Management believes that presenting the net income and earnings per share adjusted for these items provides investors with useful information in understanding the financial performance on a comparative basis.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements contained herein are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which involve risks and uncertainties.
