Colorado Springs' booming job market and high quality of life contributed to the city's climb from No. 11 to No. 2 this year, according to a press release from U.S. News.\nMeanwhile, Huntsville offers employment opportunities in STEM fields and scored the highest value score out of all places on this year's list. Portland also soared from No. 32 to No. 6 largely due to more people moving to the area and a growing job market.\nFor those looking to move to a state that can boost their overall well-being, here are the top 10 happiest and healthiest states in the U.S. as of 2017 .\nLike this story?
