FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Premier League - Crystal Palace vs Brighton & Hove Albion - Selhurst Park, London, Britain - April 14, 2018 Brighton manager Chris Hughton before the match Action Images via Reuters/Alan Walter\nBrighton are 13th in the standings with 36 points and sit seven points above the relegation zone with four games left ahead of Saturday’s trip to seventh-placed Burnley.\n“It feels good to have the points in the bag and we would certainly rather be in the position we have than having to chase those points,” Hughton told a news conference.\n“But we know we have work to do still, everybody is aware of the challenge we have with the magnitude of the games we have left. We will go into every game aiming for points and until we are over the line we can’t rest easy.”\nBrighton face a tough climax to the season with matches at home to second-placed Manchester United and away to champions Manchester City and Liverpool, who are in third spot.\n“Saturday’s game is the best opportunity to get to safety because it’s our next game. That’s how you have to treat every game. I still feel the teams below us will be pushing and some will get results,” added Hughton.\n“We can’t think about a number of points we need for safety, we must take every game seriously.” Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Ken Ferris",
