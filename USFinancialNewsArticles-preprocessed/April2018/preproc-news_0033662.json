    "text": "31 COMMENTS When New York Mets general manager Sandy Alderson first started working in baseball in 1981, his Oakland Athletics threw 60 complete games—or one more than every team in the majors combined last season. Their typical 25-man roster included no more than 10 pitchers. The idea that they could possibly need any more seemed ridiculous.\nThings look quite a bit different today. The number of pitchers that teams carry at one time has slowly crept up to keep pace with changes in strategy . The accepted sweet spot settled in at 12.\nBut suddenly, most organizations have determined that even a dozen arms are not enough for the modern baseball landscape. It has resulted in a new industry standard of 13 pitchers, including eight relievers, a shift in how teams utilize their assets that reflects the latest phase of the sport’s evolution.\nThis might not sound like a huge change, but it comes with significant ramifications and provides clear insight into how the game is played in 2018.\n“In today’s game, the 13th pitcher is more valuable than the 13th player,” Alderson said.\nIn 2013, teams across MLB had 13 pitchers on their active rosters for 803 total games before rosters expanded in September, according to Stats LLC. That number grew to 2,243 games last season—a 179% increase—and it will almost certainly climb even further this year.\nKansas City Royals manager Ned Yost hands the ball to relief pitcher Brandon Maurer during a pitching change.

As a result, managers turn to the bullpen earlier and more frequently than at any other point in history, with starters accounting for less than 62% of the innings in 2017, a record low. The average starter lasted just 5 1/3 innings per outing.\nThe data shows that performance drops dramatically when a pitcher faces an opposing batting order for a third time. Hitters posted an .801 on-base-plus-slugging percentage in those situations last season, up from .724 the first time through the lineup. In response, teams simply pull their starter before that happens, putting a greater burden on relievers.\n“At some point, your worst reliever is more effective than your best starter,” Alderson said. “That crossover point is fairly early in a game often.”\nThis alone wouldn’t require a larger bullpen if relievers threw multiple innings at a time. But they don’t, at least not with any semblance of regularity. The average reliever pitches to about 4 1/2 batters per outing, down from five in 2000 and six in 1990, which explains why managers want as many arms as possible at their disposal. As St. Louis Cardinals manager Mike Matheny put it, “If you’re going to be blowing through guys, you better have somebody who’s ready to pitch.”\nHence, eight relievers.\n“The stress of the bullpen has become so great that carrying the additional arm is where managers are most comfortable,” said John Mozeliak, the Cardinals’ president of baseball operations. “When you’re trying to eliminate fatigue or overuse, having that extra arm helps ease that.”\nOnce again, the reason for this change stems from the rise of analytics, which show the benefit of using relievers based on individual matchups, leading to extreme specialization. Mets left-hander Jerry Blevins, for instance, entered Wednesday night’s contest having appeared in 10 games—and seen just 12 hitters, often entering for just one lefty slugger.\nMeanwhile, research shows that it is ideal for relievers to pitch in short, quick bursts, exerting maximum effort on every pitch instead of holding back for later. Last season, 110 different relievers threw at least one fastball of at least 98 mph, up from 91 in 2013. Managers would rather their relievers throw as hard as they can for a few batters at time and then bring in somebody else to do the same thing.\n“You’re apt to go to that when you have a bunch of guys in the ‘pen like that,” Milwaukee Brewers manager Craig Counsell said.\nOf course, an extra pitcher on the roster means teams often have one fewer option on the bench, a new normal with real implications, especially for the position players struggling to find major-league jobs. This past winter featured the slowest free-agent market ever, a freeze-out of veteran players that dominated the conversation in the baseball world all off-season.\nPlenty of factors contributed to this phenomenon, but one that didn’t receive much widespread attention relates directly to the rise of the 13-man pitching staff: With smaller benches—as few as three reserves on American League teams—certain types of players who used to be coveted no longer have a place in the game.\nNew York Mets relief pitcher Jerry Blevins entered Wednesday night’s contest having appeared in 10 games—and seen just 12 hitters. Photo: Ron Sachs/CNP/ZUMA Press Consider Mark Reynolds, who after finishing 2017 with 30 home runs and 97 RBIs couldn’t find work until he agreed to a minor-league contract with the Washington Nationals last week. Or Adam Lind, who signed a minor-league deal with the New York Yankees after posting a .303 batting average and .875 OPS a year ago.\nBoth of them play first base and left field almost exclusively, offering little defensive flexibility. Mozeliak said that with so few bench spots—one of which reserved for a backup catcher—those types of players are “pretty tough to carry.”\n“Positional versatility has become critical in the game,” Counsell said. “You need that player on your roster.”\nFor the Brewers, that player is Hernan Perez, who in his career has appeared at every position besides catcher. (Yes, he has even pitched in two games.) The previous three World Series champions have all had that sort of super-utility player: Marwin Gonzalez for last year’s Houston Astros and Ben Zobrist for the 2016 Chicago Cubs and 2015 Kansas City Royals.\nBaseball executives say this is no coincidence, with every team seeking out their own version of Zobrist. It’s a must, because 13-man pitching staffs are here to stay.\nSaid Mozeliak: “It’s been one of those things where it’s been this natural evolution.”\nWrite to Jared Diamond at jared.diamond@wsj.com",
