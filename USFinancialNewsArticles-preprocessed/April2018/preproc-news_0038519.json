    "text": "MCKINNEY, Texas, April 18, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Torchmark Corporation (NYSE: TMK) reported today that for the 2018, net income was $1.49 per diluted common share (1) , compared with $1.11 per diluted common share for the year-ago quarter. Net operating income for the quarter was $1.47 per diluted common share (1) , compared with $1.15 per diluted common share for the year-ago quarter.\nHIGHLIGHTS:\nNet income as an ROE (1) was 11.5%. Net operating income as an ROE excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities (1) was 14.6%. Life underwriting margins increased over the year-ago quarter by 7% and health underwriting margins increased over the year-ago quarter by 9%. Life premiums increased over the year-ago quarter by 9% at American Income and health premiums increased by 8% at Family Heritage. Net health sales increased over the year-ago quarter by 11%. Average producing agent counts increased over the year-ago quarter by 15% at Liberty National and 11% at Family Heritage. 1.0 million shares of common stock were repurchased during the quarter.\n(1) Includes the impact of the change in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% due to the recent tax reform. See further discussion of the tax reform on page 2.\nFINANCIAL SUMMARY\nQuarter End\n(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data)\n(unaudited)\nNet operating income, a non-GAAP (1) financial measure, has been used consistently by Torchmark's management for many years to evaluate the operating performance of the Company, and is a measure commonly used in the life insurance industry. It differs from net income primarily because it excludes certain non-operating items such as realized investment gains and losses and certain significant and unusual items included in net income. Management believes an analysis of net operating income is important in understanding the profitability and operating trends of the Company's business. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nPer Share\nQuarter Ended\nQuarter Ended\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n%\nChg.\n2018\n2017\n%\nChg.\nInsurance underwriting income (2)\n$\n1.37\n$\n1.23\n11\n$\n160.3\n$\n148.6\n8\nExcess investment income (2)\n0.53\n0.49\n8\n61.9\n59.3\n4\nParent company expense\n(0.02)\n(0.02)\n(2.3)\n(2.2)\nIncome tax (3)\n(0.37)\n(0.56)\n(34)\n(42.8)\n(67.1)\n(36)\nStock compensation benefit (expense), net of tax\n(0.04)\n—\n(5.0)\n0.1\nNet operating income\n$\n1.47\n$\n1.15\n28\n$\n172.2\n$\n138.7\n24\nReconciliation to net income (GAAP):\nReconciling items, net of tax:\nRealized gains (losses) on investments\n0.01\n(0.01)\n1.5\n(1.5)\nPart D adjustments—discontinued operations (4)\n—\n(0.03)\n(0.1)\n(3.6)\nNet income (5)\n$\n1.49\n$\n1.11\n$\n173.6\n$\n133.5\nWeighted average diluted shares outstanding\n(000)\n116,750\n120,430\n(1) GAAP is defined as accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n(2) Definitions included within this document.\n(3) In 2017, new tax legislation revised the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. In the first quarter of FY 2018, income tax expense was calculated based on the 21% rate as compared with a 35% rate for the first quarter of FY 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company recorded $877 million of tax benefits in net income as a result of re-measuring its deferred tax assets and liabilities using the lower corporate tax rate as of the date of enactment. Based on the analysis of the tax reform, the Company was able to determine that this amount is a reasonable estimate of the impact in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. However, the Company will continue to analyze relevant information to complete the accounting for income taxes which may result in an adjustment to tax expense in 2018. The accounting is expected to be complete when the 2017 U.S. corporate income tax returns are filed later in 2018. The Company did not make any adjustments to this estimate in Q1.\n(4) The remaining Part D adjustments are administrative items related to the disposition of this business.\n(5) A GAAP-basis consolidated statement of operations is included in the appendix of this report.\nNote: Tables in this news release may not sum due to rounding.\nFINANCIAL SUMMARY, CONT\nManagement vs. GAAP measures\n(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data)\n(unaudited)\nShareholders' equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, and book value per share, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, are non-GAAP measures that are utilized by management to view the business without the effect of unrealized gains or losses which are primarily attributable to fluctuation in interest rates on the available-for-sale portfolio. Management views the business in this manner because the Company has the ability and generally, the intent, to hold investments to maturity and meaningful trends can more easily be identified without the fluctuations. Shareholders' equity and book value per share are the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nMarch 31,\n2018 (1)\n2017\nNet income as an ROE (2)\n11.5\n%\n11.5\n%\nNet operating income as an ROE (excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities)\n14.6\n%\n14.2\n%\nShareholders' equity\n$\n5,820\n$\n4,745\nImpact of adjustment to exclude net unrealized gains on fixed maturities\n(1,067)\n(820)\nShareholders' equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities\n$\n4,753\n$\n3,925\nBook value per share\n$\n50.13\n$\n39.61\nImpact of adjustment to exclude net unrealized gains on fixed maturities\n(9.19)\n(6.84)\nBook value per share, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities\n$\n40.94\n$\n32.77\n(1) Includes the effects of recent tax reform legislation.\n(2) Calculated using average shareholders' equity for the measurement period.\nCONTINUING INSURANCE OPERATIONS – comparing the first quarter 2018 with first quarter 2017:\nLife insurance accounted for 72% of the Company's insurance underwriting margin for the quarter and 70% of total premium revenue.\nHealth insurance accounted for 27% of Torchmark's insurance underwriting margin for the quarter and 30% of total premium revenue.\nNet sales of life insurance decreased 4%, while net health sales increased 11%.\nINSURANCE PREMIUM REVENUE\n(Dollar amounts in millions)\n(unaudited)\nQuarter Ended\n%\nChg.\nMarch 31,\n2018\nMarch 31,\n2017\nLife insurance\n$\n598.3\n$\n575.8\n4\nHealth insurance\n251.8\n244.8\n3\nTotal\n$\n850.1\n$\n820.6\n4\nINSURANCE UNDERWRITING INCOME\n(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data)\n(unaudited)\nInsurance underwriting margin is management's measure of profitability of its life, health, and annuity segments' underwriting performance, and consists of premiums less policy obligations, commissions and other acquisition expenses. Insurance underwriting income is the sum of the insurance underwriting margins of the life, health, and annuity segments, plus other income, less insurance administrative expenses. It excludes the investment segment, parent company expense and income taxes. Management believes this information helps provide a better understanding of the business and a more meaningful analysis of underwriting results by distribution channel. Insurance underwriting income, a non-GAAP measure, is a component of net operating income, which is reconciled to net income in the Financial Summary section above.\nQuarter Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n% of\nPremium\nMarch 31,\n2017\n% of\nPremium\n%\nChg.\nInsurance underwriting margins:\nLife\n$\n154.8\n26\n$\n144.1\n25\n7\nHealth\n58.0\n23\n53.4\n22\n9\nAnnuity\n2.6\n2.6\n215.5\n200.1\n8\nOther income\n0.3\n0.5\nAdministrative expenses\n(55.5)\n(51.9)\n7\nInsurance underwriting income\n$\n160.3\n$\n148.6\n8\nPer share\n$\n1.37\n$\n1.23\n11\nInsurance Results by Distribution Channel\nTotal premium, underwriting margins, first-year collected premium and net sales by all distribution channels are shown at www.torchmarkcorp.com on the Investors page at \"Financial Reports.\"\nAmerican Income Agency was Torchmark's leading contributor to total underwriting margin ($97 million), on premium revenue of $285 million.

It is defined as net investment income less both the required interest attributable to net policy liabilities and the interest on debt. We also view excess investment income per diluted common share as an important and useful measure to evaluate performance of the investment segment as it takes into consideration our stock repurchase program.\nQuarter Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n%\nChg.\nNet investment income\n$\n218.1\n$\n208.3\n5\nRequired interest:\nInterest on net policy liabilities (1)\n(134.5)\n(128.3)\n5\nInterest on debt\n(21.6)\n(20.7)\n4\nTotal required interest\n(156.1)\n(149.0)\n5\nExcess investment income\n$\n61.9\n$\n59.3\n4\nPer share\n$\n0.53\n$\n0.49\n8\n(1) Interest on net policy liabilities is a component of total policyholder benefits (a GAAP measure).\nNet investment income increased 5%, while average invested assets increased 6%.
