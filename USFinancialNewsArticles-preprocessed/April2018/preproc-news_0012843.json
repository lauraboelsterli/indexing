    "text": "PRAGUE, April 5 (Reuters) - Growth of new car registrations in the Czech Republic is likely to slow in 2018 to 3 percent after a record 2017, the countryâ€™s Car Importers Association said on Thursday.\nSales of new cars jumped 4.6 percent last year, a level the association said would not be matched in 2018 following a slight dip in first-quarter registrations.\nIt had previously forecast 2018 growth at 3 percent to 8 percent, which was based on an external PwC study.\nReporting by Petra Vodstrcilova, Writing by Jason Hovet, Editing by Michael Kahn\n ",
