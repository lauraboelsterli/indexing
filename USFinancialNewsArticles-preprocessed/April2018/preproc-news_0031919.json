It’s going to be a day where the market is going to attempt to move a bit higher.”\nShares of Bank of America rose 0.84 percent in premarket trading after the lender reported a better-than-expected increase in quarterly profit.\nShares of JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup, all of which reported on Friday, were also higher.\nAnalysts are expecting the S&P 500 companies to record an 18.6 percent rise in profit, their strongest earnings growth in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nHowever, many traders say that reactions to results could be muted as market participants have already priced in gains from corporate tax cuts, reflected in the stock market’s strong rally in 2017 and early 2018.\nAt 8:44 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 158 points, or 0.65 percent. S&P 500 e-minis rose 16.25 points, or 0.61 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis gained 41.75 points, or 0.63 percent.\nWaning fears of a broader conflict in Syria pushed short-dated U.S. Treasury yields to their highest level in almost a decade, while crude oil prices eased due to a rise in U.S. drilling activity.\n“We’re seeing a little bit of an uptick in yields and pullback in oil, and those are likely to constrain any strong reaction to earnings and macro news,” said Cardillo.\nData on Monday showed U.S. retail sales increased more than expected in March, rising after three straight monthly declines, as households boosted purchases of motor vehicles and other big-ticket items.\nShares of Netflix, which is expected to report results after market close on Monday, rose 1.44 percent.
