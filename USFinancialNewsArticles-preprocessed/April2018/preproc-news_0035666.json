    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States believes inspectors from the global chemical weapons watchdog have not yet been able to enter the site of the April 7 alleged chemical weapons attack on the Syrian town of Douma, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on Tuesday.\nNauert said she was aware of reports from Syria that inspectors from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons had been able to see the site but “our understanding is that the team has not entered Douma.”\nShe said the United States had information that both chlorine and sarin nerve gas were used in the attack and was concerned that evidence was deteriorating the longer inspectors were kept from reaching the site.\nReporting by Lesley Wroughton; writing by David Alexander; editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ",
