No matter how exemplary a job an executive might do, maintaining shareholders’ backing is paramount. The supervisory board of Volkswagen AG is expected to vote to replace Chief Executive Matthias Müller on Friday, people familiar with the situation told the WSJ’s William Boston. If the move happens, it would mark a stunning turn for the CEO credited with steering the German car maker through its emissions scandal. \nVolkswagen isn’t just any other company, as it is controlled by a distinctive trio of stakeholders. The heirs to Ferdinand Porsche and the German state of Lower Saxony together hold more than 70% of the company’s voting stock, while the IG Metall trade union has 10 seats on its board of directors. \nMeanwhile, Volkswagen’s finance chief Frank Witter is expected to stay put in the event of a new CEO appointment, report CFO Journal’s Nina Trentmann and Mr. Boston. Mr. Witter took the CFO seat shortly after Volkswagen’s emission cheating became public in September 2015, and helped guide the company through the fallout. \n“Mr. Witter is seen as an anchor of stability at Volkswagen,” said Jürgen Pieper, senior advisor at B. Metzler seel. Sohn & Co.
