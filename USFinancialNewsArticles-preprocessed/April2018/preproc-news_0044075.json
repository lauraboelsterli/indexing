    "text": "April 20, 2018 / 12:19 AM / Updated 21 minutes ago Japan's Takeda sweetens $62 billion Shire offer Sam Nussey , Paul Sandle 3 Min Read \nTOKYO/LONDON (Reuters) - Japan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical nudged up its offer for Shire to 44.3 billion pounds ($62 billion) on Friday to try to persuade the rare-disease drugs specialist into talks after it rejected three previous proposals. \nJapan’s biggest drugmaker increased its potential cash and shares bid to 47 pounds a share, up 1 percent from its previous proposal of 46.50 pounds. It also lifted the cash component by 3.25 pounds to 21 pounds a share, a shift that analysts said was needed to appeal to Shire’s shareholders. \nShire said it was considering the new approach. \nThe latest proposal is 7 percent above Takeda’s first offer and 58 percent above London-listed Shire’s share price prior to any takeover speculation, the Japanese firm said. \nBut Shire’s shares were trading at 38.42 pounds on Friday, well below the latest approach and down 3 percent on the day after another company, Allergan, decided not to pursue its own bid on Thursday, ending the prospect of a battle. Related Coverage Takeda weighs raising Shire bid to more than 47 stg/share: sources \nBotox-maker Allergan had seen its shares fall 7 percent after Reuters reported its interest. \nInvestors in Takeda are also cautious. Its shares lost almost 5 percent of their value on Friday as investors fretted over the Japanese firm making a record-breaking purchase of the London-listed company. \nThe drugs industry has seen a flurry of dealmaking across the world, as companies look for scale and for promising new assets to bolster their pipelines.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo \nTakeda said it wanted to work with Shire to agree a recommended deal and to allow an extension to an April 25 deadline imposed by the British regulator to make a firm offer. \n“Takeda believes that the improved proposal represents a highly compelling opportunity for Shire shareholders, which reflects a further increase in value and a material increase in the cash component of the consideration mix,” it said. \nShire, which also makes drugs to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), rejected the previous three approaches, saying they significantly undervalued the company and the drugs it has in development. \nBuying Shire would be the largest ever overseas acquisition by a Japanese company and propel Takeda, led by Frenchman Christophe Weber, into the top ranks of global drugmakers. \nIt would be Weber’s boldest move by far, significantly boosting Takeda’s position in rare diseases, including a blockbuster haemophilia franchise, gastrointestinal disorders and neuroscience, where Shire is a leader in ADHD drugs.

REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett/File Photo \nBut it would be a financial stretch since Shire is worth a lot more than Takeda, which has a market capitalization of 4.1 trillion yen ($31 billion). \nBased on Takeda’s current market value, Shire shareholders would own approximately 49 percent of the enlarged company should the latest proposal be accepted.
