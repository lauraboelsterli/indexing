    "text": "ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria’s Senate on Thursday summoned President Muhammadu Buhari to testify about his administration’s response to a spate of communal killings in central states.\nFILE PHOTO: Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari attends a reception at the closing session of the Commonwealth Business Forum at the Guildhall in London, Britain on April 18, 2017. Daniel Leal-Olivas/Pool via Reuters/File Photo On Wednesday, lawmakers from the lower house of parliament also invited Buhari to discuss the clashes between semi-nomadic herdsmen and settled farmers in central states, in which hundreds of people have died this year.\nThe violence has raised questions about the government’s ability to maintain security in the country, putting pressure on Buhari less than a year before an election he is set to contest.\nReporting by Camillus Eboh; Writing by Paul Carsten\n ",
