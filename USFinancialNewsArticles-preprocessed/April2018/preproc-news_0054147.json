    "text": "Completed Enrollment in Phase 2 Study of Reldesemtiv in Patients with SMA;\nData Expected in Q2 2018\nPreparing to Initiate Second Phase 3 Clinical Trial of Omecamtiv Mecarbil\nSOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cytokinetics, Incorporated (Nasdaq:CYTK) reported financial results for the first quarter of 2018. Net loss for the first quarter was $30.3 million, or $0.56 per share, compared to a net loss for the first quarter of 2017 of $25.9 million, or $0.62 per share. Cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $255.5 million at March 31, 2018.\n“In the first quarter of 2018 we made progress advancing our muscle biology directed drug candidates in mid- and late-stage clinical trials across diseases and conditions of impaired muscle function,” said Robert I. Blum, Cytokinetics’ President and Chief Executive Officer. “We completed enrollment of our Phase 2 clinical study of reldesemtiv in patients with spinal muscular atrophy and look forward to data from that study in the second quarter which may inform future development of reldesemtiv under our collaboration with Astellas. In addition, we made further preparations to initiate the second Phase 3 clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil in patients with heart failure under our collaboration with Amgen. We also continued preclinical development activities with the objective of advancing two drug candidates into Phase 1 trials.”\nRecent Highlights and Upcoming Milestones\nCardiac Muscle Program\nomecamtiv mecarbil (cardiac myosin activator)\nContinued patient enrollment in GALACTIC-HF ( G lobal A pproach to L owering A dverse C ardiac Outcomes T hrough I mproving C ontractility in H eart F ailure), the Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil. Enrollment is proceeding towards 50 percent completion with patients randomized to date having a risk profile consistent with the trial design. The Data Monitoring Committee for GALACTIC-HF has been meeting regularly and reviewing data arising from the trial; there have been no major changes to the trial following these reviews. We expect to complete enrolling patients with chronic heart failure in GALACTIC-HF in approximately one year.\nContinued protocol development, feasibility assessments, regulatory interactions and other readiness activities for a second Phase 3 clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil . This trial is intended to evaluate the potential effect of omecamtiv mecarbil on exercise performance in patients with heart failure and is planned to be conducted by Cytokinetics in collaboration with Amgen. We are finalizing preparations to ensure readiness to begin this trial on a timeframe to be agreed soon.\nSkeletal Muscle Program\ntirasemtiv (fast skeletal muscle troponin activator (FSTA))\nConvened an advisory board of ethicists, patient advocates, trial investigators and experts in pre-approval access to assess whether and how best to continue providing tirasemtiv to those people living with ALS currently in VIGOR-ALS, the open-label extension clinical trial following VITALITY-ALS. Informed by our advisory board, we decided to close VIGOR-ALS and transition patients who wish to remain on tirasemtiv to a Managed Access Program (MAP).\nThe manuscript, “Respiratory Measures in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis,” published online in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration .\nThe manuscript, “VITALITY-ALS, a Phase III Trial of Tirasemtiv , a Selective Fast Skeletal Muscle Troponin Activator, as a Potential Treatment for Patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: Study Design and Baseline Characteristics,” published online in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration .\nreldesemtiv (CK-2127107, next-generation FSTA)\nCompleted enrollment of 70 patients in our Phase 2 clinical trial of reldesemtiv which is designed to assess its effect on multiple measures of muscle function in both ambulatory and non-ambulatory patients with SMA. This trial is being conducted by Cytokinetics in collaboration with Astellas. We expect results to be presented on June 16 at the 2018 Annual Cure SMA Conference.\nContinued site activation and patient enrollment in FORTITUDE-ALS ( F unctional O utcomes in a R andomized T rial of I nvestigational T reatment with CK-2127107 to U nderstand D ecline in E ndpoints – in ALS ), the Phase 2 clinical trial of reldesemtiv which is designed to assess the change from baseline in percent predicted slow vital capacity and other measures of skeletal muscle function after 12 weeks of treatment with reldesemtiv in patients with ALS. This trial has enrolled over 150 patients toward the objective of 445 patients and is being conducted by Cytokinetics in collaboration with Astellas. We expect results from this clinical trial in Q4 2018.\nContinued patient enrollment in the Phase 2 clinical trial of reldesemtiv in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) which is designed to assess its effect on physical function. This trial, designed to enroll 40 patients, is nearing completion and is being conducted by Astellas in collaboration with Cytokinetics. We expect results from this clinical trial in 2H 2018.\nContinued site activation and patient enrollment in the Phase 1b clinical trial of reldesemtiv in elderly subjects with limited mobility which is designed to assess its effect on measures of physical function. This trial is being conducted by Astellas in collaboration with Cytokinetics. We expect Astellas will conduct an interim analysis of data arising from this trial in Q4 2018.\nPre-Clinical Research and Development\nContinued collaboration activities under our joint research program with Astellas directed to the discovery of next-generation skeletal muscle activators.\nContinued independent research activities directed to our other muscle biology programs.\nContinued to advance development compounds under our collaborations with Amgen and Astellas. We expect to advance one of these potential drug candidates to Phase 1 in 2018.\nContinued IND-enabling studies for our unpartnered cardiac sarcomere directed compound. We expect to advance this potential drug candidate to Phase 1 in 2018.\nCorporate\nAnnounced progress against our Vision 2020 initiatives designed to advance and expand our pipeline of muscle biology directed drug candidates in late-stage development to address urgent needs of people living with conditions characterized by impaired muscle function and weakness.\nAnnounced that Robert Califf, M.D., has been appointed to the company’s Board of Directors.
