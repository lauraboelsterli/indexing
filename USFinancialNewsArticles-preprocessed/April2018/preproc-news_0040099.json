The 500-kg British bomb was discovered during building work this week, more than seven decades after the end of World War Two.\nSome 10,000 people - including residents, hospital patients and office workers - were evacuated from 9 a.m. from buildings within an 800 metre radius of the bomb while experts performed the delicate operation.\nThe bomb defusing team talks with media next to dismantled World War Two bomb at a construction site near the central train station in Berlin, Germany, April 20, 2018. REUTERS/Axel Schmidt Police posted a video on Twitter showing officers walking up the stairs in an apartment building with the caption: “We’re not bringing room service or breakfast in bed but a personal wake-up call.”\nSlideshow (9 Images) The gave the all the clear in the early afternoon and the city began getting back to normal.\nLong-distance and local train transport at the central station was disrupted for several hours but police said on Twitter that the station had now re-opened. Bus and tram services also restarted.\nThe evacuation area included the Natural History Museum, the BND intelligence agency, a clinic of the Charite hospital and an army hospital.\nSome roads were closed but were due to gradually reopen.\nGermany still discovers more than 2,000 tonnes of live bombs and munitions every year.\nLast year some 60,000 people were evacuated from their homes in Frankfurt after a massive bomb dropped by Britain’s Royal Air Force was unearthed.\nReporting by Michelle Martin; additional reporting by Laura Dubois; Editing by Toby Chopra and Alison Williams\n ",
