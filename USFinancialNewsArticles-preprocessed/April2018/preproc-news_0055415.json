    "text": "MILAN (Reuters) - Italian railway group Italo said several of its shareholders re-invested in the company after it was taken over by Global Infrastructure Partners by subscribing a share issue for 150 million euros ($182 million), equal to a stake of 7.74 percent.\nIn February, Italo shareholders accepted a 1.98 billion euro takeover offer presented by U.S.-based GIP and scrapped plans for listing the company on the Milan bourse.\nThe closing of the deal was signed on Thursday.\nItalo added in a statement that Luca Cordero di Montezemolo and Flavio Cattaneo were confirmed as the companyâ€™s chairman and CEO, respectively. Both are among the shareholders who decided to re-invest in Italo through the capital increase.\n($1 = 0.8256 euros)\nReporting by Agnieszka Flak, editing by Giulia Segreti\n ",
