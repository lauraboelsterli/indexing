Forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results, performance, prospects, and opportunities to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements in this news release include, but are not limited to, statements regarding: the ability of the Company to achieve material sales growth. Forward-looking statements are necessarily based on a number of estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable, are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to: the ability of the Company to retain or attract qualified personnel to successfully implement products and services following the sales process; those additional risks set out in the Company's public documents filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com ; and other matters discussed in this news release. Although the Company believes that the assumptions and factors used in preparing the forward-looking statements are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on these statements, which only apply as of the date of this news release, and no assurance can be given that such events will occur in the disclosed time frames or at all. Except where required by law, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThis news release contains references to certain financial measures that do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities. These non-GAAP financial performance measures should be viewed as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, the Company’s results of operations reported under IFRS. These financial measures are identified and defined below:\n“Recurring Revenue” includes monthly software subscriptions, and resale of cellular and satellite data. Recurring revenue is recognized monthly as services are delivered and is derived from the subscription revenue category within the Company's financial statements. The Company believes that Recurring Revenue provides useful information to investors because it shows the long-term nature of recurring service revenue.\nA “Subscriber” is defined as a customer's individual asset which is monitored by a telematics device. A Subscriber is an important metric for our investors because it provides an indication of our ability to generate Recurring Revenue from providing recurring service to our customers.\n\"Average Revenue Per Unit\" is calculated monthly as Recurring Revenue divided by the average number of Subscribers during the month. We believe ARPU helps to identify trends and to indicate whether we have been successful in attracting and retaining higher value Subscribers.\nPlease refer to the Company’s December 31, 2017 MD&A dated April 12, 2018 for additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures.\nNeither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nSource:Trakopolis IoT Corp.",
