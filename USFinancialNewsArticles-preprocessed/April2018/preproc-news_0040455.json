    "text": "Marks Seventh Consecutive Year with a Dividend Increase\nNEWTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Hospitality Properties Trust (Nasdaq: HPT) today announced it has raised its regular quarterly cash distribution on its common shares by $0.01 to $0.53 per common share ($2.12 per share per year). This distribution will be paid to HPT’s common shareholders of record as of the close of business on April 30, 2018 and distributed on or about May 17, 2018. Since August 2012, HPT’s common dividend has increased annually for seven consecutive years for a total increase of 17.8%.\nHospitality Properties Trust is a real estate investment trust, or REIT, which owns a diverse portfolio of hotels and travel centers located in 45 states, Puerto Rico and Canada. HPT's properties are operated under long term management or lease agreements. HPT is managed by the operating subsidiary of The RMR Group Inc. (Nasdaq: RMR), an alternative asset management company that is headquartered in Newton, Massachusetts.\nWARNING REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nTHIS PRESS RELEASE CONTAINS FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 AND OTHER SECURITIES LAWS. THESE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED UPON HPT’S PRESENT BELIEFS AND EXPECTATIONS, BUT THESE STATEMENTS AND THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE STATEMENTS ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO OCCUR AND MAY NOT OCCUR FOR VARIOUS REASONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND HPT’S CONTROL. FOR EXAMPLE, THIS PRESS RELEASE STATES THAT HPT’S DIVIDEND RATE WILL BE $0.53/SHARE PER QUARTER OR $2.12/SHARE PER YEAR. A POSSIBLE IMPLICATION OF THIS STATEMENT IS THAT HPT WILL CONTINUOUSLY PAY QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS OF $0.53/SHARE PER QUARTER OR $2.12/SHARE PER YEAR IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, THIS PRESS RELEASE ALSO STATES THAT HPT HAS INCREASED ITS DIVIDEND ANNUALLY FOR SEVEN CONSECUTIVE YEARS AND FOR A TOTAL INCREASE OF 17.8%. A POSSIBLE IMPLICATION OF THIS STATEMENT IS THAT HPT WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE ITS ANNUAL DIVIDEND IN THE FUTURE. HPT’S DIVIDEND RATES ARE SET AND RESET FROM TIME TO TIME BY HPT’S BOARD OF TRUSTEES. THE HPT BOARD CONSIDERS MANY FACTORS WHEN SETTING DIVIDEND RATES INCLUDING HPT’S HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED INCOME, NORMALIZED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS, THE THEN CURRENT AND EXPECTED NEEDS AND AVAILABILITY OF CASH TO PAY HPT’S OBLIGATIONS, DISTRIBUTIONS WHICH MAY BE REQUIRED TO BE PAID TO MAINTAIN HPT’S TAX STATUS AS A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST AND OTHER FACTORS DEEMED RELEVANT BY HPT’S BOARD OF TRUSTEES IN ITS DISCRETION. ACCORDINGLY, FUTURE DIVIDEND RATES MAY BE INCREASED OR DECREASED AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE RATE AT WHICH FUTURE DIVIDENDS WILL BE PAID. FOR THESE REASONS, AMONG OTHERS, INVESTORS ARE CAUTIONED NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE UPON ANY FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS PRESS RELEASE.\nA Maryland Real Estate Investment Trust with transferable shares of beneficial interest listed on the Nasdaq.\nNo shareholder, Trustee or officer is personally liable for any act or obligation of the Trust.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180419005164/en/\nHospitality Properties Trust\nKatie Strohacker, 617-796-8232\nSenior Director, Investor Relations\nwww.hptreit.com\nSource: Hospitality Properties Trust",
