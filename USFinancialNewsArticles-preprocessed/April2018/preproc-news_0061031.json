Consistent with IFRS for a reverse takeover (“RTO”) transaction, the number of common shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 2017 (50,346,986)(and that which is reflected at December 31, 2016, having adjusted retrospectively for the 8-for-1 share rollback: 2,769,486) are those of Contact Gold, the legal entity, while the values reflected are those of Carlin Opportunities Inc. (“Carlin”), the accounting acquirer. Similarly, the comparative financial information presented herein and in the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2017 (the “Consolidated Financial Statements”), reflects only the assets, liabilities and operations of Carlin since its incorporation.\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements, and the corresponding MD&A are available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nAttributable to shareholders: Three months ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Year ended\nDecember 31, 2017 For the period from\nincorporation on\nNovember 23, 2016 to\nDecember 31, 2016 Loss for the period $ 2,237,579 $ 3,238,190 $ 274,048 Loss and comprehensive loss for the period $ 1,959,019 $ 6,028,565 $ 274,048 Basic and diluted loss per share $ 0.04 $ 0.10 $ 0.05\nAs at December 31, 2017 As at December 31, 2016\nCash $ 6,176,258 $ 250 Working capital/(deficit) $ 6,239,022 $ (1,001,710 ) Total assets $ 45,424,278 $ 731,673 Current liabilities $ 524,212 $ 1,005,471 Preferred shares $ 9,466,747 $ -nil Shareholder’s equity/(deficit) $ 35,348,230 $ (273,798 ) Losses attributable to shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $3.2 million, reflect primarily (i) non-cash expenses arising from the RTO transaction ($2.2 million “listing expense”), (ii) exploration and evaluation of the Company’s exploration property interests ($4.3 million), and (iii) costs incurred for professional, legal and advisory fees, wages and salaries and for investor relations activities (in aggregate, $3.2 million), net of (i) a fair value adjustment recognized on the embedded derivatives within the Preferred Shares (gain of $5.8 million) and (ii) foreign currency gains of $0.6 million). Losses from the period from incorporation on November 23, 2016 to December 31, 2016 relate to the professional, legal and advisory fees incurred in order to secure the transactions that gave rise to the establishment of Contact Gold (the “Transactions”).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, exploration and evaluation expenditures predominantly related to activity at the Pony Creek property with the commencement of an active drill program in July. Approximately $4.0 million in expenditures had been incurred through year end for exploration at Pony Creek.\nOther comprehensive loss attributable to shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $2.8 million, and reflects the foreign currency impact arising on the post-acquisition carrying value of the Contact Gold Properties.\nNet cash operating outflows for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $6.1 million reflects the commencement of an active exploration program at Pony Creek, marketing and investor relations activities, and the settlement of balances due to service providers and vendors after closing of the Transactions.\nThe Company’s has elected to capitalize mineral property acquisition costs, and expense exploration expenditures as incurred. Total assets at December 31, 2017 comprise primarily: exploration and evaluation assets of $38.5 million, including the acquisition “bump” of $35.01 million attributed to, and subsequently allocated across, the individual properties and assets acquired by Contact Gold, net of a $2.9 million foreign currency adjustment, and $0.4 million in cash. At December 31, 2016, total assets included $0.73 million in expenditures deferred in advance of closing the Transactions. Some of the deferred balance at year end was subsequently included as part of the $0.59 million in cost capitalized to the acquisition of the Contact Gold Properties, while a portion was included within the total of $1.56 million share issue costs, offsetting the value of share capital.\nTotal liabilities at December 31, 2017, include the value of the Preferred Shares ($9.46 million), and accounts payable and accruals ($0.52 million). The Preferred Shares were concluded to be a form of obligation and have been included as a non-current liability. The terms and conditions of the Preferred Shares are detailed in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting value of the Preferred Shares reflects both a “host” component of the instrument and certain embedded derivatives. At inception these were determined to be $8.14 million and $6.85 million, respectively. The fair values of each will change from period to period, reflecting (i) an accretion to the host, (ii) a fair value adjustment, and the (iii) the impact of foreign exchange on the embedded derivatives ($0.9 million, $0.6 million gain, and $5.8 million gain, respectively in the period from issuance to December 31, 2017).\nThe scientific and technical information contained in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Vance Spalding, CPG, VP Exploration, Contact Gold, who is a “qualified person” within the meaning of National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”).\nDrill intercepts were calculated using a minimum thickness of 3.05 metres averaging 0.14 ppm gold and allowing inclusion of up to 4.57 metres of material averaging less than 0.14 ppm gold for low grade intervals and higher-grade intervals were calculated using a minimum thickness of 3.05 metres averaging 1.00 ppm gold and allowing inclusion of up to 4.57 metres of assays averaging less than 1.00 ppm gold. True width of drilled mineralization is unknown, but owing to the apparent flat lying nature of mineralization, is estimated to generally be at least 70% of drilled thickness. Quality Assurance / Quality Control consists of regular insertion of certified reference standards, blanks, and duplicates. All failures are followed up with additional investigation whenever such an event occurs. Multi element geochemical assays are completed on composites using the MEMS 61 method. All assays are completed at ALS Chemex; an ISO 17025:2005 accredited lab. Check assays are being assayed for gold by Bureau Veritas\nPony Creek is an early stage exploration property and does not contain any mineral resource estimates as defined by NI 43-101. There has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource estimate at Pony Creek or on any of Contact Gold’s properties.
