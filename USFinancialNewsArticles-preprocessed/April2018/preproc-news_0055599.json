    "text": "BOSTON (Reuters) - Massachusetts’ top federal prosecutor defended immigration authorities’ decision to arrest a Chinese woman at a courthouse this week after she was sentenced to probation, a move that outraged the judge overseeing her case.\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling speaks to reporters at his office in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S., January 24, 2018. REUTERS/Nate Raymond/File Photo The judge had expressed concern that the presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at court proceedings could scare off potential witnesses who faced immigration issues. Immigrant advocates have raised similar worries about courthouse arrests under Republican President Donald Trump.\nU.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling in a statement late Thursday said the ICE agents who took Xinyan Wang, 27, into custody outside Boston’s federal courthouse were “doing their jobs: enforcing federal law.”\n“Their efforts to protect the public should be applauded, not criticized,” said Lelling, a Trump appointee.\nThe arrest occurred after U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani on Wednesday sentenced Wang to 12 months of probation for using a fake Chinese passport to take a graduate school entrance exam for another Chinese national.\n“I see no reason for places of redress and justice to become places that people are afraid to show up,” Talwani said.\nMichael Shea, the acting special agent in charge of Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations in Boston, expressed gratitude for Lelling’s support.\nShea said his agency’s mission “may under certain circumstances require enforcement actions to be carried out in courthouse surroundings.”\nIn January, Wang pleaded guilty to charges she used a counterfeit Chinese passport and a bogus visa to pose as someone else to take a Graduate Record Exam, or GRE, in October.\nWang was paid to take the GRE or the TOEFL, the English-language exam used to assess foreign applicants, five other times under assumed names, according to court papers.\nWang was previously a graduate student at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania, but after her adviser’s laboratory’s funding ran out, she enrolled in a community college to keep her student visa, according to her lawyer, Syrie Fried.\nShe said Wang is now seeking asylum as she fears reprisal from the people who made the documents she used.\nReporting by Nate Raymond; Editing by Scott Malone\n ",
