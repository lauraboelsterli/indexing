FILE PHOTO: Special envoy to the United Nations for climate change Michael Bloomberg speaks during the One-on-One discussion panel with International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Christine Lagarde on side of the IMF/World Bank spring meeting in Washington, U.S., April 19, 2018. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas/File Photo \nPresident Donald Trump last year pulled the United States out of the agreement, making the country the only one opposed to the pact. \nBloomberg, in a CBS interview, did not commit to provide funds beyond this year and said he hopes by next year Trump will have changed his mind. \nTrump staunchly opposes the agreement and his administration has rolled back a number of environmental regulations.
