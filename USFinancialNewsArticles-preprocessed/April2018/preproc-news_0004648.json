In December Energa said three offers had been submitted to build the Ostroleka plant, all of which overshot the original budget of 4.8 billion zlotys. \nPolish energy minister had said Ostroleka will be the last coal-fuelled power plant built in Poland. ($1 = 3.4181 zlotys) (Reporting by Agnieszka Barteczko Editing by Marcin Goettig)",
