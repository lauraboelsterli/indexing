Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Wells Fargo had charged more than 800,000 customers for unneeded auto insurance, the expense of which pushed approximately 274,000 Wells Fargo customers into delinquency and resulted in almost 25,000 vehicle repossessions; (ii) the foregoing conduct, when it came to light, would foreseeably subject Wells Fargo to heightened regulatory scrutiny and/or enforcement actions; and (iii) as a result, Wells Fargo’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.\nFollow us for updates on Twitter: twitter.com/GPM_LLP .\nIf you purchased shares of Wells Fargo, you may move the Court no later than April 16, 2018 to ask the Court to appoint you as lead plaintiff.
