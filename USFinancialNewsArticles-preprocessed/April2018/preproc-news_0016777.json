    "text": "MX3D , a Dutch robotics firm, 3D printed a functional stainless steel bridge for pedestrians in Amsterdam's red light district.\nThe 41-foot-long bridge took four robots, 9,920 pounds of stainless steel and six months of printing to complete. MX3D combined an industrial robot, a welding machine and software to make the 3D printers.\nMX3D also wants to add sensors to the bridge to monitor changes in its health over time.\nThe footbridge will undergo a number of load tests before it's installed in Amsterdam in 2019.",
