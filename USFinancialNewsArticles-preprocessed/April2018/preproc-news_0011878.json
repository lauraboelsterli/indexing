Photo: Gary Cameron/Reuters A decade after the financial crisis , The Wall Street Journal has checked in on dozens of the bankers, government officials, chief executives, hedge-fund managers and others who left a mark on that period to find out what they are doing now. Today, we spotlight former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and former Attorney General Eric Holder.\nEric Holder has gone from serving as the nation’s top prosecutor to being one of the business world’s leading advisers.\nHe was sworn in as U.S. Attorney General in February 2009 as policy makers were straining to support financial markets after the collapse of Lehman Brothers a few months earlier.\nUnder his leadership, the Justice Department negotiated several billion-dollar settlements for fraud tied to the mortgage market. But Mr. Holder has faced criticism for not prosecuting anyone on Wall Street for their roles in the financial crisis.\nFrom right to left, Mr. Holder and Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer prepared to testify on Capitol Hill in 2010. Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated Press He stepped down in 2015 to return to Covington & Burling LLP, a Washington law firm known for representing banking clients where Mr. Holder is part of a unit charged with internal corporate investigations.\nThe 67-year-old attorney recently took on the case of ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc., which had been dogged by allegations of gender bias and sexual harassment . Mr. Holder’s team in June 2017 recommended the company reduce founder Travis Kalanick’s leadership role and that it make executives more accountable for fixing problems. Mr. Kalanick stepped down as CEO later that year under pressure from Uber shareholders.\nMr. Holder declined a request for an interview.\nRelated Timothy Geithner: Former Treasury Secretary Is Now a Private-Equity Firm Executive Neel Kashkari: Fed Official Who Bailed Out Big Banks Is Now One of Their Biggest Critics James Cayne: Ex-Bear CEO Now Plays Bridge, Not Markets Kyle Bass: Won Big Betting on Housing Collapse, Now Falters With China Bets Alan Schwartz: Last Bear Head Takes on Wall Street Nobody Thinks the Bailout Would Happen Again A Decade Later, Seeds of Instability Are Germinating How Bear Wrecked Something More Valuable than Money He has recused himself from working on matters that were the subject of Justice Department litigation during his time in office. But he still gets blamed for not prosecuting any individuals from companies at the heart of the financial crisis.\n“A lot of Americans felt they were screwed and all the fat cats that got them into the situation got off scot-free,” said Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economics professor and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve.\nThe former attorney general has said the view that he went easy on banks is “misplaced.” At a Democratic Platform Drafting Committee hearing in June 2016, he said, “we had in some cases statutory and sometimes factual inabilities to bring the cases we wanted to bring.”\nMr. Holder, seen here in 1999, served as deputy attorney general under President Bill Clinton.

A decade later, WSJ's finance and banking editors break down the events that led to the 2008 financial crisis. Photo: Associated Press Mr. Holder, who also served as deputy attorney general under President Bill Clinton, maintains a toehold in politics. He heads the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, where he is pushing states to redraw legislative district maps which it says have been used to help protect Republican majorities.\nHe has criticized President Donald Trump’s administration, saying that the president’s broadsides against the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation undermine the credibility of law-enforcement agents.\nMr. Holder hasn’t said whether he plans to seek office.\n“I think I’ll make a decision by the end of the year about whether there is another chapter in my government service,” he told reporters at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast in February.\nMr. Holder hasn’t said whether he plans to seek office.
