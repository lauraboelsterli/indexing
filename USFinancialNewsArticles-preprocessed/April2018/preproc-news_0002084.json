    "text": "LONDON, April 1 (LPC) - The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has closed an increased US$16bn syndicated loan that refinances a US$10bn facility signed in 2016, according to banking sources.\nThe deal, which closed on March 19, comprises a US$8.35bn term loan and a US$7.65bn murabaha financing.\nHSBC, JP Morgan and MUFG were coordinators, bookrunners and mandated lead arrangers on the deal with Bank of China, Citibank, Credit Agricole, ICBC, Mizuho Bank, Standard Chartered and SMBC as bookrunners and mandated lead arrangers. BNP Paribas, Goldman Sachs, Societe Generale joined as mandated lead arrangers and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley acted as lead arrangers, according to data from Thomson Reuters LPC.\nAs well as the introduction of the Islamic finance tranche the new deal included the extension of its maturity to 2023 from 2021 and a repricing.\nPricing on the deal is 30% lower than on the original loan, which paid 120bp over Libor, bringing pricing on the new deal to 84bp over Libor.\nThe original five-year loan was also coordinated by HSBC, JP Morgan and MUFG, which were joined by BNP Paribas, Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Citibank, Credit Agricole, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, ICBC, Mizuho Bank, Morgan Stanley and SMBC.\nThe Saudi government started issuing debt in the international markets through loans and bonds two years ago in order to refill state coffers hit by a slump in oil prices.\nIts Vision 2030 is a plan to reduce the Kingdomâ€™s dependence on oil, diversify its economy, and develop public service sectors such as health, education, infrastructure, recreation and tourism.\n ",
