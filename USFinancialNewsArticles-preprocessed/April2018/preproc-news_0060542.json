    "text": "April 28, 2018 / 4:48 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Brazil police investigating shooting at Lula supporters' camp-out Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nSAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian police were investigating a shooting in which one person was injured at a camp-out of supporters of former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in front of federal police headquarters in Curitiba.\nSecurity authorities for the state of Paraná said in a statement “an individual on foot fired shots against a camp-out of former president Lula’s supporters” and that “one person was injured and taken to the hospital”.\nThe names of the injured supporter and the hospital were not released.\nForensic experts found an unspecified number of 9 mm bullet shells at the site and local police are investigating.\nGleisi Hoffmann, a senator from Lula’s Workers Party, said more than 20 shots were fired and that the supporter, a union leader, was shot in the neck.\nThe Workers Party said in a statement the camp-out was the target of a “fascist attack” for political reasons.\nLula, sentenced to 12 years for corruption and money laundering, has been detained at the headquarters of the federal police in the southern town of Curitiba since April 7.
