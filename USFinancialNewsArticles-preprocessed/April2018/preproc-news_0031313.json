    "text": "(Reuters) - American Airlines Group Inc on Sunday resumed flying routes that use Russian airspace after having rerouted flights on Saturday due to its monitoring of “global geopolitical issues”, a spokesman said.\nFILE PHOTO: An American Airlines Boeing 767-300ER aircraft takes off from Zurich Airport January 9, 2018. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday evening announced military strikes targeting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s chemical weapons capabilities.\nOn Saturday, American Airlines’ Dallas-Beijing, Dallas-Hong Kong and Chicago-Beijing flights had stopped in Los Angeles to refuel because the routes cannot be flown non-stop without the use of Russian airspace.\n“The team at American regularly monitors global geopolitical issues and makes changes to aircraft routings when warranted,” the spokesman said. “We operated our normal schedule April 15.”\nRussian President Vladimir Putin warned on Sunday that further attacks on Russian ally Syria would bring chaos to world affairs.\nA broad agreement that allows U.S. and Russian jets to use each other’s airspace is set to expire this week, logistics industry publication The Loadstar reported earlier this month.\nReporting by Jamie Freed in Singapore; additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by Stephen Coates\n ",
