We are thrilled to join forces with them and look forward to growing our market share in the Gulf South.”\nBalance Sheet\nConsolidated assets increased $486.2 million to $2.3 billion at March 31, 2018. $400.8 million of the increase can be attributed to the acquisition of First Community Bank.\nTotal loans were $1.517 billion at March 31, 2018, as compared to $1.225 billion at December 31, 2017, and $1.140 billion at March 31, 2017, representing increases of $291.3 million or 23.8%, and $376.6 million or 33.0%, respectively. The acquisition of First Community Bank accounted for $274.7 million of the total increase in loans as compared to the fourth and first quarter of 2017. Loans excluding those purchased from First Community Bank grew $34.5 million or 2.8% during the first quarter of 2018.\nLoan Sale - First Community Bank had approximately $10 million of criticized and classified loans. At closing, these problem assets were recorded at fair value and approximately $9 million of the $10 million portfolio was sold to a third party. This transaction removed a majority of the previously identified problem loans from First Community Bank’s portfolio and resulted in a total acquired loan portfolio balance of $265 million with a fair value credit mark of approximately 1.5%.\nTotal deposits were $1.992 billion at March 31, 2018, as compared to $1.471 billion at December 31, 2017, and $1.568 billion at March 31, 2017, representing increases of $521.1 million or 35.4%, and $423.1 million or 27.0%, respectively. The acquisition of First Community Bank accounted for $357.4 million of the total increase in deposits as compared to the fourth and first quarter of 2017. The sequential-quarter increase in non-acquired deposits was primarily due to an increase in NOW accounts of $95.2 million, which is attributable to the seasonality of the public fund deposits.\nAsset Quality\nNonperforming assets totaled $14.8 million at March 31, 2018, an increase of $1.3 million compared to $13.5 million at December 31, 2017 and an increase of $1.5 million compared to March 31, 2017. The majority of the increase in same quarter comparison was in the past due 90 days and over category. The ratio of the allowance for loan and leases losses (ALLL) to total loans was 0.57% at March 31, 2018 and 0.68% at December 31, 2017. Including valuation accounting adjustments on acquired loans, the total valuation plus ALLL was 1.16% of total loans at March 31, 2018.

Net interest income for the first quarter of 2018 was $16.4 million, an increase of $2.2 million when compared to the first quarter of 2017. The increase is primarily due to interest income earned on a higher volume of loans. Net interest margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 3.62% as compared to 3.77% for the same quarter in 2017.\nNon-interest income increased $0.1 million for the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to increased service charges and interchange fee income.\nFirst quarter 2018 non-interest expense decreased $1.5 million, or 9.3% as compared to the first quarter of 2017. Excluding acquisition charges of $1.8 million and $3.6 million for first quarter 2018 and 2017, respectively, non-interest expense increased $0.3 million as compared to first quarter 2017, attributed to the acquisition.\nFully tax equivalent (“FTE”) net interest income totaled $16.6 million and $14.5 million for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively. FTE net interest income increased $2.1 million in the prior year quarterly comparison primarily due to an increase in interest earned on loans.

FTE net interest income increased $1.1 million to $16.6 million from $15.5 million in sequential-quarter comparison. The increase was due primarily to increased loan volume. Interest income from purchase accounting adjustments decreased slightly in sequential quarter comparison.\nThe average yield on all earnings assets decreased in sequential-quarter comparison from 4.25% to 4.19%. Average interest expense increased 7 basis points from 0.60% for the fourth quarter of 2017 to 0.67% for the first quarter of 2018. Cost of deposits averaged 44 bps for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 38 bps for the fourth quarter of 2017. Public funds are up $131.2 million when comparing March 31, 2018 to December 31, 2017.\nNon-interest income decreased $0.1 million in sequential-quarter comparison resulting from decreased mortgage income of $0.3 million, offset by increases in service charges on deposit accounts and interchange fee income of $0.2 million.\nNon-interest expense increased $2.2 million in sequential-quarter comparison, which reflects increases in salaries and employee benefits and other professional services. Merger-related costs of $1.8 million were included in other professional services and other non-interest expense for the first quarter of 2018.\nDeclaration of Cash Dividend\nThe Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.05 per share, to be paid on its common stock on May 22, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 7, 2018.\nAbout The First Bancshares, Inc.\nThe First Bancshares, Inc., headquartered in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, is the parent company of The First, A National Banking Association.

However, certain non-GAAP measures are used by management to supplement the evaluation of our performance.

The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release allow management and investors to understand and compare results in a more consistent manner for the periods presented in this press release. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental and not a substitute for the Company’s results reported in accordance with GAAP for the periods presented, and other bank holding companies may define or calculate these measures differently. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation and do not purport to be an alternative to net income, earnings per share, net interest income, book value or other GAAP financial measures as a measure of operating performance. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure is provided in this press release following the Condensed Consolidated Financial Information (unaudited).\nForward Looking Statements\nThis news release contains statements regarding the projected performance of The First Bancshares, Inc. and its subsidiary.
