Chongqing Municipality Communist Party Secretary Sun Zhengcai attends the opening session of China's National People's Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China March 5, 2017. REUTERS/Jason Lee \nSun, 54, was abruptly removed from his post as the ruling Communist Party’s chief of the southwestern metropolis of Chongqing - one of China’s most important cities - in July, and replaced by Chen Miner, who is close to President Xi Jinping. \nChinese prosecutors in February charged Sun with accepting “huge sums” in bribes during various posts going back 15 years in Chongqing, Beijing, Jilin province, and as minister of agriculture. \n“Defendant Sun Zhengcai did not object to any of the facts of the accusations and the charges,” the first intermediate court in the northeastern city of Tianjin said in one of a series of posts on its official microblog. \nSun is certain to be found guilty as the courts are controlled by the party and will not challenge the accusations against him. \nIt has not been possible to reach Sun or a representative for comment since he was put under investigation last year. \nXi has presided over a sweeping corruption crackdown since coming to power in 2012 and has vowed to target both “tigers” and “flies”, a reference to elite officials and ordinary bureaucrats. \nThousands of officials have been jailed and punished in a campaign that has also brought down dozens of senior party and military officials.
