    "text": "EditorsNote: Edit 1: Syntax issues, clarified streak\nGary Sanchez hit a three-run homer with none out in the bottom of the ninth inning off Fernando Rodney as the New York Yankees extended their winning streak with a 4-3 victory over the Minnesota Twins on Thursday afternoon at Yankee Stadium.\nSanchez got New York’s winning streak up to six by lifting an 0-1 96 mph fastball into the left-field seats off Rodney (1-2).\nUpon rounding the bases, Sanchez flung his helmet as he approached the celebration at the plate where he was mobbed by teammates. He was then doused with Gatorade by Domingo German while getting ready to conduct a postgame interview.\nIt was the catcher’s sixth homer of the season and first walk-off homer and hit. It was New York’s first walk-off homer since Brett Gardner on July 27, 2017 versus Tampa Bay.\nBefore Sanchez won it, Rodney was betrayed by some shaky defense from third baseman Miguel Sano. Sano committed a throwing error on a ball hit by Didi Gregorius and then cut in front of shortstop Ehire Adrianza on a grounder by Giancarlo Stanton.\nSanchez’s homer capped a day when the Yankees were held without a hit until Gardner singled with two outs in the sixth off Kyle Gibson.\nGibson recorded his first career double-digit strikeout game with 10 and held the Yankees to one hit in six innings.\nThe Twins finished their first 0-7 road trip since Aug. 10-16, 2001.\nEduardo Escobar hit a two-run homer off Jordan Montgomery and Robbie Grossman homered off German for the Twins.\nIncluding the wild-card game, Minnesota has dropped its last eight games to the Yankees. Minnesota lost the Yankees for the 12th time in the last 13 regular-season visits to New York.\nMontgomery allowed two runs and four hits in five innings while running up his pitch count.\nDellin Betances (1-1) struck out the side in the ninth for New York.\nAaron Hicks drove in the other run with a sacrifice fly for the Yankees.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
