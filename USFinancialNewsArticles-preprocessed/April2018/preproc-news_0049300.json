    "text": "NEW YORK, April 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Attorney Advertising -- Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC notifies investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Edge Therapeutics, Inc. (\"Edge\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: EDGE) and certain of its officers, on behalf of shareholders who purchased or otherwise acquired Edge securities between December 29, 2017 and March 27, 2018, both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm's site: http://www.bgandg.com/edge .\nThis class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nThe Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) that the Company's lead product candidate EG-1962 would likely fail a futility analysis in connection with the NEWTON 2 study; and, (2) that, as a result of the foregoing, Edge's financial statements and Defendants' statements about Edge's business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.\nOn March 28, 2018, Edge revealed, \"that a pre-specified interim analysis on data from the Day 90 visit of the first 210 subjects randomized and treated in the Phase 3 NEWTON 2 study of EG-1962 demonstrated a low probability of achieving a statistically-significant difference compared to the standard of care in the study's primary endpoint, if the study is fully enrolled.\" The Data Monitoring Committee also \"recommended that the study be stopped based on its conclusion that the study has a low probability of meeting its primary endpoint.\" Based on the DMC recommendation, Edge stated that it has decided to end the Phase 3 NEWTON 2 study. Following this news, Edge stock dropped $14.28 per share, or roughly 92%, to close at $1.31 per share on March 28, 2018.\nA class action lawsuit has already been filed.
