For more information, please visit www.synergychc.com .\nSynergy’s brands:\nFlat Tummy ®\nFlat Tummy Tea’s uniquely formulated two-step herbal detox tea works to naturally help speed metabolism, boost energy and reduce bloating to flatten your tummy. It is currently sold online to a 20-30 year old female, predominantly American market.\nSince being founded in 2013, Flat Tummy has grown rapidly, largely attributed to the strength of its branding and its innovative and effective use of social media marketing. The secret is a very specific process and ROI based algorithm used on various social media platforms. To date, Flat Tummy has built a targeted social media following of over 1,500,000, many of whom are now customers.\nFlat Tummy now has over 13,500 positive written reviews on its website, www.flattummyco.com or visit its Instagram page.\nFOCUSfactor ®\nFOCUSfactor is sold at America’s leading retailers such as Costco, Sam’s Club, Wal-Mart, BJ’s Walgreens, CVS and The Vitamin Shoppe. FOCUSfactor, America’s leading brain health supplement, is a nutritional supplement that includes a proprietary blend of brain supporting vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and other nutrients. In December 2012, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued US Patent 8,329,227 covering FOCUSfactor’s proprietary formulation “for enhanced mental function”. The issuance of the patent marked one of the few times a patent has been issued for a nationally branded nutritional supplement. FOCUSfactor is clinically tested with results demonstrating improvements in focus, concentration and memory in healthy adults. More information on FOCUSfactor can be found at www.focusfactor.com .\nPer-fékt Beauty ®\nPer-fékt Beauty is one of Synergy's newest brands that was acquired in June of 2017. Per-fékt Beauty markets and sells a specialized range of beauty products (makeup, skin-care & body) via retailers and online through social media channels.\nPer-fékt Beauty is well established in the beauty retail space, opening up an exciting retail opportunity for the rest of our products in that industry. Even more exciting is the potential to apply the same ROI based algorithm that Flat Tummy uses and is currently being used by The Synergy Effect on various online marketing platforms – what could be more per-fekt?\nPer-fékt Beauty can be found at www.perfektbeauty.com or visit their Instagram page.\nThe Queen Pegasus ®\nThe Queen Pegasus is Synergy's newest brand that launched in August of 2017. The Queen Pegasus markets and sells a lash elixir kit exclusively online through social media channels.\nThe Queen Pegasus is being marketed on the same ROI based algorithm that Flat Tummy and Sneaky Vaunt use and is currently being used by The Synergy Effect on various online marketing platforms.\nThe Queen Pegasus can be found at www.thequeenpegasus.com .\nSneaky Vaunt ®\nSneaky Vaunt is one of Synergy's newest brands that launched in March of 2017. Sneaky Vaunt markets and sells a backless, strapless, stick on, push up bra exclusively online through social media channels.\nSneaky Vaunt is being marketed on the same ROI based algorithm that Flat Tummy uses and is currently being used by The Synergy Effect on various online marketing platforms. In just over nine months, Sneaky Vaunt has built a targeted social media following of over 400,000 on Instagram.\nSneaky Vaunt can be found at www.sneakyvaunt.com or visit their Instagram page.\nHand MD ®\nHand MD is the world’s first anti-aging skincare line formulated specifically for the hands. Hands reveal a woman’s true age and the rejuvenation of the hand has become women’s #1 aging concern. Developed by Kara Harshbarger and renowned celebrity dermatologist Dr. Alex Khadavi, Hand MD’s extensive clinical trials show significant improvement in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, skin hydration, hyper-pigmentation and radiance. HAND MD launched on QVC and sold out in an astonishing 5 minutes. More information on Hand MD can be found at www.hand-md.com .\nNeuragen ®\nNeuragen ® is a topical product that works directly at the site of the pain as opposed to oral products. Neuragen ® reduces the spontaneous firing of damaged peripheral nerves. By calming these firings at the source, Neuragen ® is clinically shown to reduce shooting and burning pains quickly and without the side effects of orally taken medications. This is in part due to the small lipophilic molecules found in Neuragen ® which rapidly carry the active ingredients through the rough outer layer of the skin to the site of the pain. Neuragen ® is available over the counter in most local pharmacies either in the diabetic section or the analgesic (pain) section. For more information, please visit www.neuragen.ca .\nThe Synergy Effect ®\nThe Synergy Effect is Synergy’s fast-growth online marketing platform, a growth engine built to grow brands exponentially online. Launched in 2017, The Synergy Effect powers Synergy’s brands online, driving revenue using best-in-class digital strategy and its proprietary ROI algorithm. Already boasting success stories including Flat Tummy and Sneaky Vaunt, both of which have experienced unprecedented growth in digital and social media, The Synergy Effect will spend the upcoming year further unlocking the huge online growth potential within Synergy’s existing portfolio of brands, as well as brands acquired by Synergy.
