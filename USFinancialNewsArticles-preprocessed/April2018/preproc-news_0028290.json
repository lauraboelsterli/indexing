REUTERS/Cathal McNaughton \nOpposition parties have already seized on the attack in India’s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh in the north, which is ruled by a rising star of the BJP. \nThe rape in the city of Unnao might never have seen the light of day, had the victim not tried to set fire to herself last week outside the residence of the chief minister in the state capital of Lucknow. \nShe was stopped by guards, but the suicide attempt brought to public attention her accusations against Kuldeep Singh Sengar, a longstanding member of the state legislature for the BJP. \nAjay Pal Singh, the lawyer for Sengar, said the allegations against the legislator were baseless and that investigations would prove his innocence. \n“This case is a conspiracy to malign Sengar and disrupt his political career,” Singh told Reuters. \nThe death of a young woman following a brutal gang rape in Delhi in 2012 sparked an outpouring of national shame and anger, but violence against women in India remains as rampant as ever. \nThe country has also been shocked by the filing of a charges this week in the state of Jammu and Kashmir alleging the abduction and rape of an eight-year-old Muslim girl in a Hindu-dominated area in January. \nThe state’s chief minister said on Twitter on Thursday that investigations were on “fast track & justice will be delivered”. \nIndia registered about 40,000 rape cases in 2016, according to latest available reports from the National Crime Records Bureau, compared with 25,000 cases in 2012. Rights activists say thousands of rapes go unreported because of the stigma.

REUTERS/Cathal McNaughton “SPEAK UP” \nHow Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath handles the allegations against his party man is being dissected by national media keen to see whether justice takes its course. \nAdityanath on Thursday asked the CBI, the equivalent to the FBI in the United States, to take over the Unnao case, police said. \n“We have collected crucial evidence and handed over all the details to the CBI to further investigate the case,” said O.P. Singh, the most senior police officer in Uttar Pradesh. \nThe rape victim told reporters at her residence that Sengar should be arrested to prevent him from influencing the investigation. \nUp until now, police had refused to investigate the victim’s accusations, she said. In a bizarre sequence of events, the victim’s father died in police custody this week, fanning suspicion that Sengar was somehow involved. \nThe victim’s father had been beaten before being taken into custody following a complaint by his assailants. Police officer Singh said they have launched an investigation into accusations that Sengar played a role in the assault. \nPolice have suspended several officers in Unnao during the past few days pending investigations into their conduct, another senior police official said.
