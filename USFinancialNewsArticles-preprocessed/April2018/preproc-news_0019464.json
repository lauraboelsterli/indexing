    "text": "Seattle third baseman Kyle Seager hit a tie-breaking two-run homer in the eighth inning and drove in three runs in the Mariners’ 4-2 victory over the Kansas City Royals at Kauffman Stadium on Wednesday afternoon.\nMitch Haniger walked with two outs in the eighth off Justin Grimm (0-1) before Seager hit his second homer of the season just over the fence in right field as the Mariners (6-4) completed a three-city road trip at 4-3.\nPaulo Orlando had a two-run double and Mike Moustakas and Cheslor Cuthbert had two hits apiece for the Royals (3-7), who have lost three of four.\nSeattle left-hander James Paxton tied his career high with 10 strikeouts for the Mariners but was not involved in the decision. He gave up two runs on six hits and a walk in six innings.\nNick Vincent (1-0) pitched a scoreless seventh inning, Juan Nicasio pitched around a walk and a single to open the eighth and Edwin Diaz recorded his fourth save in a hitless ninth. Diaz has 12 strikeouts and has not allowed a hit in five innings this season.\nDee Gordon and Robinson Cano had a hit apiece while extending hitting streaks. Gordon has hit safely in all 10 games this season and has a 16-game hitting streak dating to Sept. 26, 2017. Cano extended his hitting streak to nine games and has reached safely in all 10.\nKansas City left-hander Danny Duffy gave up four hits and two runs (one earned) in 5 1/3 innings. He struck out seven and walked three. He has walked eight in 15 innings in three starts this season.\nGordon singled to open a two-run first inning before Cano and Haniger walked with one out to load the bases. Royals catcher Cam Gallagher dropped Seager’s foul pop before Seager hit a sacrifice fly to drive in Gordon, and Cano scored on a wild pitch to make it 2-0. Duffy threw 36 pitches in the first inning, 18 balls and 18 strikes.\nMoustakas and Cuthbert singled to open the fourth inning before Orlando drove in both with a double to right to tie the game at 2.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
