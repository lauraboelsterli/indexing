    "text": "BEIJING, April 27 (Reuters) - London aluminium prices edged down on Friday, having jumped in the previous session as investors bet that U.S. sanctions would remain in place on Russian producer Rusal, keeping supply tight. The metal is trading lower for a fifth session out of seven and has lost 8.2 percent so far this week, putting it on course for its biggest weekly drop since the week ended Aug. 5, 2011. FUNDAMENTALS * LME ALUMINUM: Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was down 0.3 percent to $2,268.50 a tonne by 0149 GMT, after ending up 1.3 percent on Thursday. * SHFE ALUMINIUM: The most-traded June aluminium contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange was up 0.2 percent to 14,450 yuan ($2,281) a tonne. It is down by around 4 percent this week but up 4.5 percent for the month. * RUSAL: Rusal's head of sales Steve Hodgson is leaving the company, a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday. * COLUMN: U.S. sanctions on Rusal shatter aluminium's supply chain: Andy Home. * COPPER: Copper was trading down 0.4 percent at $6,937 a tonne on a firm dollar, which makes metals expensive for holders of other currencies. Shanghai copper was down 0.3 percent to 51,570 yuan a tonne. * COPPER: Chile's Escondida, the world's largest copper mine, said on Thursday that early contract talks with its workers' union ended without an agreement, setting the stage for legally scheduled negotiations to begin in June. * CANADA: Canadian miner Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd on Thursday said it is planning to divest all of its cobalt assets in Canada and that it sold some gold interests in the United States.
