    "text": "HOUSTON and LONDON, April 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nNet income: $1.2 billion, a 54% increase relative to 1Q17 EBITDA: $1.9 billion, an 18% increase relative to 1Q17 Record quarterly EBITDA for our Intermediates and Derivatives segment Diluted earnings per share: $3.11 per share Dividend increased by 11% to $1.00 per share Dividends and share repurchases totaled $514 million; repurchased 1.3 million shares during the first quarter\nComparisons with the prior quarter and first quarter 2017 are available in the following table:\nTable 1 - Earnings Summary\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\nMarch 31,\nMillions of U.S. dollars (except share data)\n2018\n2017\n2017\nSales and other operating revenues\n$9,767\n$9,135\n$8,430\nNet income\n1,231\n1,894\n797\nDiluted earnings per share (U.S. dollars)\n3.11\n4.79\n1.98\nWeighted average diluted share count (millions)\n395\n395\n403\nEBITDA (a)\n1,913\n1,726\n1,617\n(a)\nSee the end of this release for an explanation of the Company's use of EBITDA and Table 7 for reconciliations of EBITDA to net income.\nLyondellBasell Industries (NYSE: LYB) today announced net income for the first quarter 2018 of $1.2 billion, or $3.11 per share. First quarter 2018 EBITDA was $1.9 billion.\n\"We started 2018 with strong operations, capturing higher margins for several of our products and advancing our organic and inorganic growth programs. EBITDA improved by 11% relative to the fourth quarter and by 18% relative to the first quarter 2017. Global polyolefins demand remained solid. While U.S. ethylene prices weakened, a tight market for polyolefins supported a polyethylene price increase and strong chain margins. Our Intermediates and Derivatives business achieved record quarterly EBITDA for the segment, driven primarily by higher margins, while our reliability initiatives at the Houston refinery resulted in strong operations during the first quarter,\" said Bob Patel, LyondellBasell CEO.\n\"In February we announced our agreement to acquire A. Schulman, Inc., a leading global supplier of high-performance plastic compounds and composites. This acquisition builds upon our existing compounding business and will create value for our shareholders and customers while also providing a platform for future growth. In March we launched our recycled polyolefins joint venture, Quality Circular Polymers (QCP), with SUEZ which allows us to contribute to the circular economy in a way that no plastics company has before,\" said Patel.\nOUTLOOK\n\"We are beginning to see the typical seasonal margin improvements in oxyfuels and refining, and we look forward to the benefits of continued high operating rates in the second quarter. Over the past two months, the U.S. market has experienced an imbalance between ethylene production and consumption, but this is expected to improve as the downstream derivative units attain full operating rates. Robust global demand and recent higher oil prices continue to support strong polyolefin pricing. LyondellBasell's organic growth program continues with our Hyperzone HDPE and PO/TBA projects on track,\" Patel said.\nLYONDELLBASELL BUSINESS RESULTS DISCUSSION BY REPORTING SEGMENT\nLyondellBasell manages operations through five operating segments: 1) Olefins and Polyolefins – Americas; 2) Olefins and Polyolefins – Europe, Asia and International; 3) Intermediates and Derivatives; 4) Refining; and 5) Technology.\nOlefins & Polyolefins - Americas (O&P-Americas) – Our O&P–Americas segment produces and markets olefins and co-products, polyethylene and polypropylene.\nTable 2 - O&P–Americas Financial Overview\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\nMarch 31,\nMillions of U.S. dollars\n2018\n2017\n2017\nOperating income\n$651\n$667\n$559\nEBITDA\n780\n784\n723\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 versus three months ended December 31, 2017 – EBITDA decreased $4 million versus the fourth quarter 2017. Fourth quarter 2017 results included a last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventory charge of $22 million. Compared to the prior period, olefins results decreased approximately $75 million. Ethylene margin declined by approximately 2 cents per pound and volume decreased due to reduced derivative operating rates. Combined polyolefins results improved approximately $35 million primarily due to an increase in the polyethylene spread over ethylene. Joint venture equity income increased by $8 million.\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 versus three months ended March 31, 2017 – EBITDA increased $57 million versus the first quarter 2017. First quarter 2017 included a $31 million gain on the sale of property in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Compared to the prior period, olefins results decreased by approximately $70 million primarily due to lower volumes. Combined polyolefins results increased by approximately $155 million driven by polyethylene and polypropylene spread improvements of approximately 11 cents per pound and 5 cents per pound, respectively.\nOlefins & Polyolefins - Europe, Asia, International (O&P-EAI) – Our O&P–EAI segment produces and markets olefins and co-products, polyethylene and polypropylene, including polypropylene compounds.\nTable 3 - O&P–EAI Financial Overview\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\nMarch 31,\nMillions of U.S. dollars\n2018\n2017\n2017\nOperating income\n$373\n$224\n$401\nEBITDA\n518\n356\n529\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 versus three months ended December 31, 2017 – EBITDA increased by $162 million versus the fourth quarter 2017. Fourth quarter 2017 results included a LIFO inventory charge of $20 million and a pension charge of $20 million. Compared to the prior period, olefins results increased approximately $70 million. Ethylene margin improved by approximately 6 cents per pound and volume increased due to the absence of fourth quarter maintenance at the Wesseling site. Combined polyolefins results increased approximately $50 million primarily due to higher volumes. Joint venture equity income improved by $7 million.\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 versus three months ended March 31, 2017 – EBITDA decreased by $11 million versus the first quarter 2017. The first quarter 2018 was favorably impacted by approximately $65 million due to an increase in the euro versus the U.S. dollar exchange rate relative to first quarter 2017. Compared to the prior period, olefins and combined polyolefins results declined by approximately $20 million and $60 million, respectively, primarily due to lower margins. Joint venture equity income improved by $10 million.\nIntermediates & Derivatives (I&D) – Our I&D segment produces and markets propylene oxide (PO) and its derivatives, oxyfuels and related products and intermediate chemicals, such as styrene monomer, acetyls, ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol.\nTable 4 - I&D Financial Overview\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\nMarch 31,\nMillions of U.S. dollars\n2018\n2017\n2017\nOperating income\n$408\n$334\n$269\nEBITDA\n486\n410\n339\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 versus three months ended December 31, 2017 – EBITDA increased $76 million versus the fourth quarter 2017. Fourth quarter 2017 results included a LIFO inventory charge of $17 million. Compared to the prior period, PO and derivatives results were relatively unchanged. In intermediate chemicals, an improvement of approximately $30 million was driven by higher styrene margins partially offset by lower methanol volume. Oxyfuels and related products results improved approximately $20 million primarily due to higher margins.\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 versus three months ended March 31, 2017 – EBITDA increased $147 million versus the first quarter 2017. Results for first quarter 2017 included charges of approximately $40 million related to precious metal catalysts.
