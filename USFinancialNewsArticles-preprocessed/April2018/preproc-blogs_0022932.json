    "text": "Shares of Verifone skyrocketed more than 50 percent in extended trading after a private equity firm-led investor group announced it would acquire the electronic payment company in a $3.4 billion deal.\nVerifone's stock has fallen about 70% from its peak in 2011. The company's point-of-sale systems, including its widespread credit-card readers, have struggled in competition with lower-priced competitors, especially in emerging markets like Brazil.\nIn its last annual earnings report , for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017, the company reported a net loss of $174 million, up sharply from the previous year's net loss of only $9 million, thanks largely to restructuring charges. Revenue had been declining for the last two fiscal years, and came in at $1.87 billion for the last full fiscal year.\nPrivate equity firm Francisco Partners ls leading the investment group, which also includes British Columbia Investment Management Corporation. The group will acquire Verifone for $23.04 per share, for a total of $3.4 billion, including debt.\nThe Verifone Board of Directors unanimously approved the agreement, which is expected to close during the third quarter of 2018, subject regulatory approvals. Upon completion, Verifone will become a privately held company.\n",
