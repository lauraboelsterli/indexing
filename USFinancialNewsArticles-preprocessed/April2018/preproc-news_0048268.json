    "text": "Third Quarter Highlights Include:\nBook-to-bill ratio of 1.29 yields record bookings and backlog\nCompleted the acquisition of Themis Computer\nCompany reaffirms prior guidance and raises consolidated guidance\nfor the full year to reflect acquisition of Themis Computer\nANDOVER, Mass., April 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mercury Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRCY) ( www.mrcy.com ), reported operating results for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, ended March 31, 2018.\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Results\nTotal Company third quarter fiscal 2018 revenues were $116.3 million, compared to $107.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The third quarter fiscal 2018 results included an aggregate of approximately $15.7 million of revenue attributable to the Delta Microwave, Richland Technologies and Themis Computer acquired businesses.\nTotal Company GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $3.7 million, or $0.08 per share, compared to $7.0 million, or $0.16 per share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted earnings per share (“adjusted EPS”) was $0.30 per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $0.29 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nThird quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted EBITDA for the total Company was $25.8 million, compared to $25.0 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nCash flows from operating activities in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was a net inflow of $0.9 million, compared to a net inflow of $24.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures, was a net outflow of $(2.6) million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to a net inflow of $11.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The lower cash flow in the quarter was primarily a result of our continued investment in the business as we insource our manufacturing and integrate our acquisitions.\nAll per share information is presented on a fully diluted basis.\nBookings and Backlog\nTotal bookings for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $150.4 million, yielding a book-to-bill ratio of 1.29 for the quarter.\nMercury’s total backlog at March 31, 2018 was $429.3 million, a $111.3 million increase from a year ago. Of the March 31, 2018 total backlog, $321.0 million represents orders expected to be shipped within the next 12 months.\nManagement Comments\n“Our third-quarter financial results were affected by the prolonged continuing resolution, yet our outlook for the fiscal year and beyond remains strong,” said Mark Aslett, Mercury’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Bookings grew 41% year-over-year to a record $150 million, and we ended the third quarter with a record total backlog of $429 million. Budget-related order delays shifted approximately $11 million of revenue out of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter, but we have already recognized a majority of this revenue. Most importantly, Mercury's growth engine continued to perform strongly in the quarter, as did the business overall. As a result, we are reaffirming our prior guidance for fiscal 2018, and raising our total guidance on a consolidated basis to include Themis Computer, which we acquired during the third quarter. Driven by continued investment in the business, the mid-point of our consolidated fiscal 2018 guidance would result in 20% total Company revenue growth year-over-year, 7% organic revenue growth and approximately 23% adjusted EBITDA margins. Similarly using the guidance mid-point, we expect to extend our multi-year record of strong performance with 20% compound growth in total revenue and over 60% compound growth in adjusted EBITDA over the past five years.”\nBusiness Outlook\nThis section presents our current expectations and estimates, given current visibility, on our business outlook for the current fiscal quarter and fiscal year 2018. It is possible that actual performance will the estimates given, either on the upside or on the downside. Investors should consider all of the risks with respect to these estimates, including those listed in the Safe Harbor Statement below and in our periodic filings with the U.S. Commission, and make themselves aware of how these risks may impact our actual performance.\nFor the full fiscal year 2018, excluding Themis Computer, we currently expect revenue of $464.0 million to $468.0 million, an increase from our prior full year guidance of $460.0 million to $468.0 million. For the full fiscal year 2018, including Themis Computer, we currently expect revenue of $487.0 million to $492.0 million, and GAAP net income of $40.2 million to $41.8 million, or $0.85 to $0.88 per share, assuming approximately 47.5 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Adjusted EBITDA, including Themis Computer, for the full fiscal year is expected to be approximately $111.0 million to $113.5 million, and adjusted EPS for the full fiscal year is expected to be approximately $1.35 to $1.38 per share.\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, revenues are forecasted to be in the range of $146.7 million to $151.7 million. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately $9.4 million to $11.0 million, or $0.20 to $0.23 per share, assuming no restructuring, acquisition, or non-recurring financing related expenses in the period, an effective tax rate of approximately 34%, excluding discrete items and approximately 47.6 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 is expected to be in the range of $33.2 million to $35.7 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.43 per share.\nRecent Highlights\nApril - Mercury announced it received a $16.1 million follow-on order from a leading defense prime contractor for integrated radio frequency (RF) and digital subsystems for an advanced naval electronic support application.

Management believes that exclusion of these items assists in providing a more complete understanding of the Company’s underlying results and trends, and management uses these measures along with the corresponding GAAP financial measures to manage the Company’s business, to evaluate its performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace, and to establish operational goals. The adjustments to calculate this non-GAAP financial measure, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:\nInterest income and expense . The Company receives interest income on investments and incurs interest expense on loans, capital leases and other financing arrangements. These amounts may vary from period to period due to changes in cash and debt balances and interest rates driven by general market conditions or other circumstances outside of the normal course of Mercury’s operations.\nIncome taxes . The Company’s GAAP tax expense can fluctuate materially from period to period due to tax adjustments that are not directly related to underlying operating performance or to the current period of operations.\nDepreciation . The Company incurs depreciation expense related to capital assets purchased to support the ongoing operations of the business. These assets are recorded at cost or fair value and are depreciated using the straight-line method over the useful life of the asset. Purchases of such assets may vary significantly from period to period and without any direct correlation to underlying operating performance.\nAmortization of intangible assets. The Company incurs amortization of intangibles related to various acquisitions it has made and license agreements. These intangible assets are valued at the time of acquisition, are amortized over a period of several years after acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after acquisition.\nRestructuring and other charges. The Company incurs restructuring and other charges in connection with management’s decisions to undertake certain actions to realign operating expenses through workforce reductions and the closure of certain Company facilities, businesses and product lines. The Company’s adjustments reflected in restructuring and other charges are typically related to acquisitions and organizational redesign programs initiated as part of discrete post-acquisition integration activities. Management believes these items are non-routine and may not be indicative of ongoing operating results.\nImpairment of long-lived assets. The Company incurs impairment charges of long-lived assets based on events that may or may not be within the control of management. Management believes these items are outside the normal operations of the Company's business and are not indicative of ongoing operating results.\nAcquisition and financing costs . The Company incurs transaction costs related to acquisition and potential acquisition opportunities, such as legal, accounting, and other third party advisory fees. Although we may incur such third-party costs and other related charges and adjustments, it is not indicative that any transaction will be consummated. Additionally, the Company incurs unused revolver and bank fees associated with maintaining its credit facilities. The Company also incurs non-cash financing expenses associated with obtaining its credit facilities. Management believes these items are outside the normal operations of the Company’s business and are not indicative of ongoing operating results.\nFair value adjustments from purchase accounting. As a result of applying purchase accounting rules to acquired assets and liabilities, certain fair value adjustments are recorded in the opening balance sheet of acquired companies. These adjustments are then reflected in the Company’s income statements in periods subsequent to the acquisition. In addition, the impact of any changes to originally recorded contingent consideration amounts are reflected in the income statements in the period of the change. Management believes these items are outside the normal operations of the Company and are not indicative of ongoing operating results.\nLitigation and settlement income and expense. The Company periodically receives income and incurs expenses related to pending claims and litigation and associated legal fees and potential case settlements and/or judgments. Although we may incur such costs and other related charges and adjustments, it is not indicative of any particular outcome until the matter is fully resolved. Management believes these items are outside the normal operations of the Company’s business and are not indicative of ongoing operating results. The Company periodically receives warranty claims from customers and makes warranty claims towards its vendors and supply chain. Management believes the expenses and gains associated with these recurring warranty items are within the normal operations and operating cycle of the Company's business. Therefore, management deems no adjustments are necessary unless under extraordinary circumstances.\nStock-based and other non-cash compensation expense. The Company incurs expense related to stock-based compensation included in its GAAP presentation of cost of revenues, selling, general and administrative expense and research and development expense. The Company also incurs non-cash based compensation in the form of pension related expenses. Although stock-based and other non-cash compensation is an expense of the Company and viewed as a form of compensation, these expenses vary in amount from period to period, and are affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management, such as the market price and volatility of the Company’s shares, risk-free interest rates and the expected term and forfeiture rates of the awards, as well as pension actuarial assumptions. Management believes that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results to those of other companies, both public, private or foreign, that disclose non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation and other non-cash compensation.\nMercury uses adjusted EBITDA as an important indicator of the operating performance of its business. Management excludes the above-described items from its internal forecasts and models when establishing internal operating budgets, supplementing the financial results and forecasts reported to the Company’s board of directors, determining the portion of bonus compensation for executive officers and other key employees based on operating performance, evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in the Company’s operations, and allocating resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. The Company believes that adjusted EBITDA permits a comparative assessment of its operating performance, relative to its performance based on its GAAP results, while isolating the effects of charges that may vary from period to period without any correlation to underlying operating performance. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. The Company believes that trends in its adjusted EBITDA are valuable indicators of its operating performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company expects to continue to incur expenses similar to the adjusted EBITDA financial adjustments described above, and investors should not infer from the Company’s presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure that these costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring.\nThe following table reconciles the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to the non-GAAP financial measure.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended March 31, March 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net income $ 3,696 $ 7,048 $ 30,782 $ 16,071 Interest expense, net 999 1,756 1,087 5,426 Income taxes 2,209 3,170 (4,837 ) 3,690 Depreciation 4,277 3,233 11,752 8,917 Amortization of intangible assets 7,104 4,732 18,568 14,222 Restructuring and other charges 1,384 459 1,792 825 Impairment of long-lived assets — — — — Acquisition and financing costs 1,909 569 4,129 2,236 Fair value adjustments from purchase accounting 539 270 1,132 3,217 Litigation and settlement expense (income), net — — — 100 Stock-based and other non-cash compensation expense 3,669 3,715 13,306 11,440 Adjusted EBITDA $ 25,786 $ 24,952 $ 77,711 $ 66,144 Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure for reporting cash flow, is defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and, therefore, has not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on cash available for investment and acquisitions after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long-term value creation. The Company believes that trends in its free cash flow are valuable indicators of its operating performance and liquidity.\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company expects to continue to incur expenditures similar to the free cash flow financial adjustment described above, and investors should not infer from the Company’s presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure that these expenditures reflect all of the Company's obligations which require cash.\nThe following table reconciles the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to the non-GAAP financial measure.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended March 31, March 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Cash flows from operations $ 873 $ 24,889 $ 17,680 $ 49,410 Capital expenditures (3,475 ) (13,036 ) (11,067 ) (26,789 ) Free cash flow $ (2,602 ) $ 11,853 $ 6,613 $ 22,621\nUNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES (In thousands, except per share data) Adjusted income and adjusted earnings per share (\"adjusted EPS\") are non-GAAP measures for reporting financial performance, exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that exclusion of these items assists in providing a more complete understanding of the Company’s underlying results and trends and allows for comparability with our peer company index and industry. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company uses these measures along with the corresponding GAAP financial measures to manage the Company’s business and to evaluate its performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace. The Company defines adjusted income as income before amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and other charges, impairment of long-lived assets, acquisition and financing costs, fair value adjustments from purchase accounting, litigation and settlement income and expense, and stock-based and other non-cash compensation expense. The impact to income taxes includes the impact to the effective tax rate, current tax provision and deferred tax provision (1). Adjusted EPS expresses adjusted income on a per share basis using weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\nThe following table reconciles the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income and earnings per share $ 3,696 $ 0.08 $ 7,048 $ 0.16 Amortization of intangible assets 7,104 4,732 Restructuring and other charges 1,384 459 Impairment of long-lived assets — — Acquisition and financing costs 1,909 569 Fair value adjustments from purchase accounting 539 270 Litigation and settlement expense (income), net — — Stock-based and other non-cash compensation expense 3,669 3,715 Impact to income taxes (1) (4,082 ) (3,576 ) Adjusted income and adjusted earnings per share $ 14,219 $ 0.30 $ 13,217 $ 0.29 Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding: 47,532 44,814\nNine Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income and earnings per share $ 30,782 $ 0.65 $ 16,071 $ 0.39 Amortization of intangible assets 18,568 14,222 Restructuring and other charges 1,792 825 Impairment of long-lived assets — — Acquisition and financing costs 4,129 2,236 Fair value adjustments from purchase accounting 1,132 3,217 Litigation and settlement expense (income), net — 100 Stock-based and other non-cash compensation expense 13,306 11,440 Impact to income taxes (1) (24,648 ) (14,102 ) Adjusted income and adjusted earnings per share $ 45,061 $ 0.95 $ 34,009 $ 0.82 Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding: 47,473 41,530\n(1) Impact to income taxes is calculated by recasting income before income taxes to include the add-backs involved in determining adjusted income and recalculating the income tax provision using this adjusted income from operations before income taxes.\nMERCURY SYSTEMS, INC.
