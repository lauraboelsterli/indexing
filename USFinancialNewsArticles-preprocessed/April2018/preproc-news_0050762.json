Through sustained execution of our business strategy and healthy end markets, we delivered double-digit bookings and revenue growth in our Climate and Industrial segments and 23 percent adjusted continuing EPS growth in the first quarter. This demonstrates our continued progress in building a more sustainable and resilient company for the long-term,” said Michael W. Lamach, chairman and chief executive officer. \"At this early stage in the year, our volumes are exceeding our initial expectations and we see good pricing receptivity in the market driving margin expansion. Margin improvement is being partially dampened by persistent and rising inflation. We continue to see growth opportunities ahead as our markets and customers move toward solutions that address energy efficiency and lower greenhouse gas emissions. Overall, we are confident that we will exceed the high end of our ranges for revenue and EPS for 2018, and we plan to provide our comprehensive guidance update per our normal cadence on our second quarter earnings call.”\nHighlights from the First Quarter of 2018 (all comparisons against the first quarter of 2017 unless otherwise noted)\nBookings up 14 percent, strong organic bookings growth of 9 percent with growth across all businesses. Enterprise revenue up 13 percent, organic revenue up 8 percent with growth in virtually all products and geographies and particularly strong growth in services and parts. Enterprise reported revenue growth included approximately 4 percentage points of growth from foreign exchange and approximately 1 percentage point from acquisitions. Enterprise revenue mix was 66 percent equipment and 34 percent services and parts, reflecting our services focus. Operating margin flat; adjusted operating margin up 20 basis points driven by strong volume, positive price and productivity partially offset by material and freight inflation. Restructuring costs of $44.4M were consistent with the company's expectations. Costs were primarily related to a European footprint optimization to shift production to plants near customer demand. Q1 adjusted effective tax rate* of 20.4 percent consistent with expectations for full-year estimated adjusted effective tax rate of 21 percent to 22 percent.\nFirst-Quarter Business Review (all comparisons against the first quarter of 2017 unless otherwise noted)\nClimate Segment: delivers energy-efficient products and innovative energy services.

Organic bookings is defined as reported orders closed/completed in the current period adjusted for the impact of currency and acquisitions.\nCurrency impacts on net revenues and bookings are measured by applying the prior year’s foreign currency exchange rates to the current period’s net revenues and bookings reported in local currency. This measure allows for a direct comparison of operating results excluding the year-over-year impact of foreign currency translation.\nAdjusted operating income is defined as GAAP operating income plus restructuring costs in 2018 and 2017. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures on tables 3 and 4 of the news release.\nAdjusted operating margin is defined as the ratio of adjusted operating income divided by net revenues.\nAdjusted continuing EPS in 2018 is defined as GAAP continuing EPS plus restructuring costs and debt redemption premium and related charges, net of tax impacts. Adjusted continuing EPS in 2017 is defined as GAAP continuing EPS plus restructuring costs, net of tax impacts. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures on tables 3 and 4 of the news release.\nFree cash flow in 2018 and 2017 is defined as net cash provided by (used in) continuing operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus cash payments for restructuring. In 2018, the Company updated its definition of free cash flow to exclude the impacts of discontinued operations. As a result, free cash flow amounts in 2017 have been restated to conform with the current year definition. Please refer to the free cash flow reconciliation on table 8 of the news release.\nWorking capital measures a firm’s operating liquidity position and its overall effectiveness in managing the enterprises’ current accounts.\nWorking capital is calculated by adding net accounts and notes receivables and inventories and subtracting total current liabilities that exclude short term debt, dividend payables and income tax payables. Working capital as a percent of revenue is calculated by dividing the working capital balance (e.g. as of March 31) by the annualized revenue for the period (e.g. reported revenues for the three months ended March 31) multiplied by 4 to annualize for a full year.\nAdjusted effective tax rate for 2018 is defined as the ratio of income tax expense, plus or minus the tax effect of adjustments for restructuring costs and debt redemption premium and related charges, divided by earnings from continuing operations before income taxes plus restructuring costs and debt redemption premium and related charges. Adjusted effective tax rate for 2017 is defined as the ratio of income tax expense, plus or minus the tax effect of adjustments for restructuring costs, divided by earnings from continuing operations before income taxes plus restructuring costs. This measure allows for a direct comparison of the effective tax rate between periods.\nAdjusted OI + D&A is defined as adjusted operating income plus depreciation and amortization expense.\nINGERSOLL-RAND PLC\nCondensed Consolidated Income Statement\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nUNAUDITED\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net revenues $ 3,384.5 $ 3,000.6 Cost of goods sold (2,420.2 ) (2,126.1 ) Selling and administrative expenses (720.9 ) (659.5 ) Operating income 243.4 215.0 Interest expense (72.9 ) (54.0 ) Other income/(expense), net (4.0 ) (4.7 ) Earnings before income taxes 166.5 156.3 Provision for income taxes (33.0 ) (28.7 ) Earnings from continuing operations 133.5 127.6 Discontinued operations, net of tax (9.4 ) (6.5 ) Net earnings 124.1 121.1 Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (3.7 ) (4.0 ) Net earnings attributable to Ingersoll-Rand plc $ 120.4 $ 117.1 Amounts attributable to Ingersoll-Rand plc ordinary shareholders:\nContinuing operations $ 129.8 $ 123.6 Discontinued operations (9.4 ) (6.5 ) Net earnings $ 120.4 $ 117.1 Diluted earnings per share attributable to Ingersoll-Rand plc ordinary shareholders:\nContinuing operations $ 0.51 $ 0.47 Discontinued operations (0.03 ) (0.02 ) $ 0.48 $ 0.45 Weighted-average number of common shares outstanding:\nDiluted 253.0 262.6 INGERSOLL-RAND PLC\nBusiness Review\n(In millions, except percentages)\nUNAUDITED\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018 2017 Climate\nNet revenues $ 2,609.8 $ 2,324.1 Segment operating income * 260.4 217.3 and as a % of Net revenues 10.0 % 9.4 % Industrial\nNet revenues 774.7 676.5 Segment operating income * 59.9 65.8 and as a % of Net revenues 7.7 % 9.7 % Unallocated corporate expense (76.9 ) (68.1 ) Total\nNet revenues $ 3,384.5 $ 3,000.6 Consolidated operating income $ 243.4 $ 215.0 and as a % of Net revenues 7.2 % 7.2 % * Segment operating income is the measure of profit and loss that the Company uses to evaluate the financial performance of the business and as the basis for performance reviews, compensation and resource allocation.

This supplemental schedule provides non-GAAP financial information and a quantitative reconciliation of the difference between the non-GAAP financial measures and the financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, not a substitute for or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
