    "text": "The French ambassador to the U.S. has stepped in to quash speculation surrounding a tree gifted to President Donald Trump from French President Emmanuel Macron.\nTrump and Macron planted the oak tree sapling on the White House lawn during Macron's state visit to the U.S. last week.\nDays later, a Reuters photographer took a photo that showed just a yellow patch of grass where it was planted on the South Lawn.\nYuri Gripas | Reuters A yellow spot is seen where the tree planted by French President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President Donald Trump on April 23 stood on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, April 28, 2018. The disappearance prompted a flurry of speculation online as to its whereabouts.\nBut French Ambassador to the U.S., Gerard Araud, tweeted that the sapling had been put in quarantine to comply with U.S. customs regulations, and would be replanted at a later date.\nTweet\nThat prompted responses asking what the point was of quarantining a plant that had already been planted, to which ambassador Araud said that \"the roots were enclosed in a plastic protection.\"\nshow chapters Trump to Macron: We've developed a wonderful friendship 10:29 AM ET Tue, 24 April 2018 | 05:56 The sapling was taken from Belleau Wood, where more 2,000 American marines died, and over 7,000 were injured, in a battle in June 1918 during World War I.\nReferring to the gift on Twitter, Macron said it \"grew from the earth where the blood of your soldiers was spilled to defend France.\"\nTweet\nHe also said that the tree would be a reminder \"of these ties that bind us\" during a trip where Macron sought to strengthen the relationship between the two countries.\nTweet\nImages and videos of the tree planting ceremony outside the White House went viral, spawning memes and media organizations remarking on the blooming \"bromance\" between Trump and Macron, as well as the close rapport between their first ladies Melania Trump and Brigitte Macron.\nThe White House has not yet responded to media requests regarding the whereabouts and well-being of the tree.\nWATCH: Trump's fight against 'fake news' has been a boon for media companies show chapters Trump's fight against 'fake news' has been a boon for media companies 11:50 AM ET Tue, 24 April 2018 | 01:49",
