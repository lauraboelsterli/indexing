    "text": " 10 AM / Updated 11 minutes ago Afghan media safety in the spotlight as gunmen kill journalist Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nKANDAHAR, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Gunmen killed an Afghan journalist on his way to work in the southern city of Kandahar on Tuesday, officials said, an attack that highlights the risks faced by media workers in Afghanistan. \nAbdul Manan Arghand, who worked for Kabul News TV, was shot by gunmen armed with AK-47s as he was driving his car, police spokesman Zia Durani said. \nThe attack came the same day as a meeting in Kabul to discuss how to safeguard journalists. The U.N. mission in Afghanistan issued a statement condemning the killing. \nLast year was the bloodiest for journalists in Afghanistan, according to the Afghan Journalistsâ€™ Safety Committee, with at least 20 killed and 169 cases of violence or threats.
