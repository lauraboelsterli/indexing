    "text": "April 27 (Reuters) - Below are company-related news and stories from French and Benelux media which could have an impact on the region’s markets or individual stocks.\nFrench CAC futures were up 0.1 percent by 0610 GMT.\nAIRBUS: Airbus bowed to weak demand for its A330 passenger jet on Friday, announcing a cut in production for 2019 after a series of bruising defeats to Boeing in contests for wide-body jets.\nBPCE/NATIXIS/ROTHSCHILD: Francois Perol has left BPCE and has joined Rothschild.\nCAPGEMINI : Capgemini on Thursday announced strong growth in its sales and order backlog for the first quarter, driven by Europe and North America, and said it was on the lookout for small and medium-sized acquisitions to complete its portfolio of offers.\nFRENCH ECONOMY: French economic growth slowed slightly more than expected in the first quarter as business investment and exports eased, a first estimate from the INSEE statistics agency said on Friday.\nHEINEKEN: Heineken said on Thursday it appointed Dolf Van Den Brink as new president of Asia Pacific region.\nKERING : French luxury group continued to collaborate with an Italian tax investigation into its Gucci brand, Chairman Francois-Henri Pinault told shareholders on Thursday, adding the company had not been notified of the sums under scrutiny.\nKLEPIERRE : French property group Klepierre said on Thursday it was still interested in acquiring assets in Britain after its failed attempt to take over rival Hammerson, despite a difficult commercial environment there.\nRENAULT: Renault said revenue rose by a smaller-than-expected 0.2 percent in the first quarter, as the French carmaker suffered sales setbacks in India, China and South Korea, compounded by the effects of a stronger euro.\nSAINT GOBAIN : French construction materials group St Gobain reported a dip in first quarter sales on Thursday, as currency swings such as a drop in the dollar impacted business, although the group kept its general 2018 financial outlook.\nSANOFI: French drugmaker Sanofi posted sluggish first-quarter profits on Friday, hurt by exchange rate effects and lower sales at its struggling diabetes and cardiovascular unit, and hinted at another difficult quarter ahead.\nVINCI : France’s Vinci posted a 4.9 percent rise in first-quarter sales on Thursday, helped by acquisitions, robust concessions activity and a recovering French construction market.\nPan-European market data: European Equities speed guide FTSE Eurotop 300 index DJ STOXX index Top 10 STOXX sectors Top 10 EUROSTOXX sectors Top 10 Eurotop 300 sectors Top 25 European pct gainers Top 25 European pct losers Main stock markets: Dow Jones Wall Street report Nikkei 225 Tokyo report FTSE 100 London report Xetra DAX Frankfurt items CAC-40 Paris items World Indices Reuters survey of world bourse outlook European Asset Allocation Reuters News at a glance: Top News Equities Main oil report Main currency report\n ",
