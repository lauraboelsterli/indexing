Their ongoing leadership and detailed input into the strategic vision of Belgravia is essential in the achievement of the Company’s business goals and objectives. Belgravia has been very active, during the first quarter of 2018, building value in the Incubator, Royalty & Management Services, and Investments divisions.”\nIncubator Division Update:\nBelgravia has reviewed a number of opportunities to support the development of early stage businesses. These opportunities included potential acquisitions and joint ventures in the healthcare and technology areas. The Company has decided to aggressively pursue developing a biotechnology-based dermatology company. As reported in the press release of April 18, 2018, Dr. Sam Hanna assumed leadership for all medical aspects of development in this area. The active pharmaceutical ingredients will be based on, or related to, natural plant active pharmaceutical ingredients where there is strong evidence of efficacy for the treatment of unmet medical needs for skin conditions. Dr. Hanna, Chief Medical Officer, with additional biotechnology managers to be announced, is reviewing target receptors for the identified skin conditions. The Company is also investigating related patent and other intellectual protection and, is defining a number of formulations. This will be followed by pre-clinical work that will be carried out in conjunction with contract research organizations. The biotechnology division is held by ICP Organics. The name of this wholly-owned subsidiary will be changed to reflect the investment in the healthcare industry.\nRoyalty & Management Services Division Update:\nYear-to-date Belgravia has been awarded management service contracts with a value of $525,000.

This investment is expected to have a value of USD$12.2 million.\nInvestments Division Corporate Update:\nBelgravia Holdings has deployed $1.9 million in its Investments Division portfolio. The portfolio includes eleven investments. The investments are in the following sectors: healthcare, technology, and minerals and resources.
