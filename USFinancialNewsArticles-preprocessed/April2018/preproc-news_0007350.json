    "text": "WASHINGTON, April 4 (Reuters) - China’s Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai said on Wednesday it was China’s preference to resolve the trade dispute with Washington through negotiations but “it takes two to tango.”\nSpeaking to reporters after an hour-long meetings at the State Department with Acting U.S. Secretary of State John Sullivan, he said: “Negotiation would still be our preference, but it takes two to tango. We will see what the U.S. will do.” (Reporting by Lesley Wroughton, editing by G Crosse)\n ",
