(ADNOC) listed shares in its retail petrol station unit in 2017.\n“We are on track for the IPO in the second half of 2018,” EGA’s CEO Abdulla Jassem Kalban told reporters in Abu Dhabi.\nThe company is likely to list between 10 to 15 percent of the company, Reuters previously reported, citing a source. The company has not commented on the size of the flotation.\nThe potential listing comes as Abu Dhabi restructures its industrial sector, hoping to attract foreign investors via privatization after lower energy prices in the past few years depleted its coffers.\nEGA was created in 2013 when state funds Mubadala and Investment Corp of Dubai (ICD) merged their aluminium companies. Its enterprise value was put at $15 billion at the time.\nEGA exports 90 percent of its output, including half a million tonnes to the United States, Kalban said, where U.S. President Donald Trump has pressed ahead with tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. A UAE official told Reuters the UAE was seeking an exemption to the tariffs which the U.S. has handed to some allies.\nGovernment talks between the UAE and the United States are “progressing very well,” Kalban said.\nThe United States “is a good market, we will continue supplying customers,” he added.\nEGA’s Al Taweelah refinery is 82 per cent complete and is on track to be operational in first half of 2019, Kalban said, adding that it plans to expand a 2.6 million tonnes per annum smelter to 4 million tonnes. He did not give a timeline. (Writing by Alexander Cornwell, editing by Louise Heavens)\n ",
