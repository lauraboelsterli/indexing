Second quarter revenue was driven by growth across all product areas compared to last year, primarily in tungsten slurries, dielectrics slurries, and CMP pads. Net income for the quarter was a record $29.7 million, which is $11.5 million, or 62.7%, higher than the same quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) was a record $1.14, which is $0.43, or 60.6%, higher than in the same quarter last year. Cash flow from operations was $36.5 million. As of March 31, 2018, the company had $461.4 million of cash and $137.5 million of debt on its balance sheet. In April, the company paid off its remaining outstanding Term Loan.\n“Our second quarter results represent continued strong financial performance with record revenue for the fourth consecutive quarter, as well as record net income and EPS for our company,” said David Li, President and CEO of Cabot Microelectronics. “These results were supported by strong semiconductor industry demand, primarily in memory, as well as our sustained focus on executing our strategic initiatives. Looking ahead, we believe we remain well-positioned for continued profitable growth, benefiting from the ongoing ramp of 3D NAND and FinFET technologies, and our ability to deliver innovative, high-quality CMP solutions to our customers worldwide.”\nKey Financial Information – Second Fiscal Quarter\nRevenue was $143.0 million, which is $23.8 million, or 20.0%, higher compared to the same quarter last year. The company achieved record quarterly revenue in dielectrics slurries and pads, which grew 24.0% and 22.6% year-over-year, respectively. Revenue from tungsten slurries grew 16.6% year-over-year.\nGross profit margin for the quarter was 52.5%, compared to 50.4% reported in the same quarter a year ago. Gross profit margin this quarter included $1.3 million of NexPlanar amortization expense. Excluding this, non-GAAP gross profit margin was 53.4%. Gross profit margin this quarter benefited from higher sales volume and a high-value product mix, partially offset by higher fixed manufacturing costs, including higher incentive compensation expense.\nOperating expenses, which include research, development and technical, selling and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, were $38.0 million in the second fiscal quarter. Operating expenses were $1.9 million higher than the same quarter a year ago, primarily due to higher incentive compensation and annual merit increases.\nNet income for the quarter was $29.7 million, which is $11.5 million, or 62.7%, higher than in the same quarter last year. Net income increased primarily due to higher revenue and a higher gross profit margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Non-GAAP net income was $31.3 million, which is $11.9 million, or 61.6%, higher than the prior year.\nDiluted EPS was $1.14 this quarter, which is $0.43, or 60.6%, higher than in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. On a non-GAAP basis, diluted EPS was $1.19, which is $0.43, or 56.6%, higher than last year.\nKey Financial Information – Year to Date\nRevenue for the first half of the fiscal year was $283.0 million, which is $40.5 million, or 16.7%, higher than last year.\nGross profit margin was 52.7% of revenue, compared to 50.1% last year. Non-GAAP gross profit margin for the first half of the fiscal year, excluding the NexPlanar amortization expense, was 53.6%.\nTotal operating expenses were $74.9 million, which is $5.4 million higher than the prior year. Operating expenses include approximately $0.9 million of the referenced amortization expense.\nNet income was $26.7 million, which is $13.9 million, or 34.2%, lower than the same period last year. Net income includes the one-time impact of the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“tax reform”), and the referenced amortization expense. Non-GAAP net income was $62.3 million, which is $19.7 million, or 46.1%, higher than the same period last year.\nDiluted EPS was $1.02, which is $0.58, or 36.3%, lower than the same period last year, and includes the impact of tax reform. Year to date, non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.39, which is $0.71, or 42.3%, higher than last year.\nGuidance Update and Capital Deployment Details\nThe company now expects its GAAP gross profit margin for the full fiscal year to be between 51% and 53%, an increase from the company’s prior full year guidance range of 50% to 52%. This includes approximately 100 basis points of NexPlanar amortization expense.\nThe company now expects GAAP operating expenses for the full fiscal year to be between $148 million and $153 million, an increase from the company’s prior full year guidance range of $145 to $150 million. This includes approximately $1.9 million of NexPlanar amortization expense.\nAs announced in March 2018, the company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share on the company's common stock, representing an increase of 100% over the previous quarterly cash dividend. The dividend will be payable on or about April 30, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 23, 2018. The $0.40 dividend would represent an annualized rate of $1.60 per share, or approximately $40 million in aggregate, and equivalent to approximately 33% of the company’s 2017 fiscal year free cash flow 1 .\n1 Free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital expenditures.\nRELATED SLIDES\nSlides related to this press release are available at www.cabotcmp.com under the Investor Relations center as of approximately the same time that this press release is issued.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nCabot Microelectronics Corporation’s quarterly earnings conference call will be held today at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (9:00 a.m. Central Time).

The non-GAAP financial information provided in this press release is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, the company’s financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the investor's understanding about the company's ongoing operations. Specifically, the company believes the one-time impact of tax reform and NexPlanar amortization expenses are not indicative of its core operating results, and thus presents these certain metrics excluding these effects. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation table of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is contained in this press release.\nABOUT CABOT MICROELECTRONICS CORPORATION\nCabot Microelectronics Corporation, headquartered in Aurora, Illinois, is the world's leading supplier of CMP polishing slurries and second largest CMP pads supplier to the semiconductor industry.

Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 Six Months Ended March 31, 2018 U.S. GAAP Adjustments Non-GAAP U.S. GAAP Adjustments Non-GAAP Gross profit $ 75,045 $ 1,309 $ 76,354 $ 149,059 $ 2,545 $ 151,604 Gross profit as a percentage of revenue (1) 52.5 % 53.4 % 52.7 % 53.6 % Operating Income 37,088 1,777 38,865 74,200 3,480 77,680 Operating Income as a percentage of revenue (2) 25.9 % 27.2 % 26.2 % 27.5 % Net income (3) $ 29,737 $ 1,529 $ 31,266 $ 26,654 $ 35,672 $ 62,326 Diluted earnings per share (4) $ 1.14 $ 0.05 $ 1.19 $ 1.02 $ 1.37 $ 2.39 (1) Non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 excludes $1,309 of NexPlanar amortization expense. Non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of revenue for the six months ended March 31, 2018 excludes $2,545 of NexPlanar amortization expense. (2) Non-GAAP operating income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 excludes the item mentioned above in (1) plus $468 of NexPlanar amortization expense recorded in operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating income for the six months ended March 31, 2018 excludes the item mentioned above in (1) plus $935 of NexPlanar amortization expense recorded in operating expenses. (3) Non-GAAP net income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 excludes the items mentioned above in (1) and (2) plus $212 for a change in estimated withholding taxes and re-measurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 related to U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) enacted on December 22, 2017. These adjustments are partially offset by a $460 increase in the provision for income taxes related to excluding NexPlanar amortization. Non-GAAP net income for the six months ended March 31, 2018 excludes the items mentioned above in (1) and (2) plus $33,092 of one-time tax expense due to Tax Act. These adjustments are partially offset by a $900 increase in the provision for income taxes related to excluding NexPlanar amortization. (4) Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is calculated based upon Non-GAAP net income. The one-time impact of the Tax Act reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.01 and $1.27 for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, respectively.
