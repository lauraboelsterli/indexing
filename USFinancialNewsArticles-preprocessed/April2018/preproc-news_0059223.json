Results of Operations\nNet interest income before provision for loan losses for the first quarter of 2018 was $9.6 million, a decrease of $142 thousand, or 1.5%, compared to $9.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to a $245 thousand increase in interest expense, partially offset by a $103 thousand increase in interest income.\nInterest income from the contractual interest rates on loans increased $405 thousand, or 4.1%, during the first quarter, reflecting a 4.0% increase in average loans and an 11 basis point increase in the average contractual interest rate. The amount of discount accretion on SBA loans decreased $343 thousand during the quarter due to a reduction in SBA loan payoffs during the first quarter of 2018. The reported interest income on loans, net of SBA discount accretions and other components, increased $115 thousand during the quarter.\nThe reported interest income and yield on our loan portfolio are impacted by a number of components, including changes in the average contractual interest rate earned on loans and the amount of discount accretion on SBA loans. The following table reconciles the contractual interest income and yield on our loan portfolio to the reported interest income and yield for the periods indicated.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 Interest Interest & Interest (Dollars in thousands) & Fees Yield Fees Yield & Fees Yield Contractual interest rate $ 10,185 5.24% $ 9,780 5.13% $ 8,310 4.91% SBA discount accretion 567 0.29% 910 0.48% 523 0.31% Amortization of net deferred fees/(costs) 51 0.03% (16 ) -0.01% 59 0.03% Interest recognized on nonaccrual loans 20 0.01% 42 0.02% 24 0.01% Prepayment penalties and late fees 25 0.01% 17 0.01% 13 0.01% Yield on loans (as reported) $ 10,848 5.58% $ 10,733 5.63% $ 8,929 5.27% Interest expense for the first quarter of 2018 increased $245 thousand compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, due to an increase of $29.5 million, or 5.8% in average balance of interest-bearing liabilities and an increase of 15 basis points in average cost of interest-bearing liabilities.\nNet interest margin for the first quarter of 2018 decreased 13 basis points to 4.56% from 4.69% for the fourth quarter of 2017, due to the increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities and the decrease in the reported yield on loans.\nNet interest income before provision for loan losses for the first quarter of 2018 increased $1.4 million, or 16.5%, compared to $8.2 million for the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to a $2.0 million or 21.7%, increase in interest income, partially offset by an increase of $643 thousand in interest expense.\nThe increase in interest income was primarily due to a 14.9% increase in average loans, including loans held-for-sale, and a 31 basis point increase in the yield on average loans to 5.58% from 5.27% for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in interest expense was due to a 17.3% increase in average interest-bearing liabilities and a 36 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The increases in the average yields on loans and average cost of deposits were primarily due to cumulative market rate increases by the Federal Reserve of 75 basis points through three rate hikes of 25 basis points in each of June 2017, December 2017 and March 2018.\nNet interest margin for the first quarter of 2018 increased 9 basis points to 4.56% from 4.47% for the first quarter of 2017.\nThe following table shows the asset yields, liability costs, spreads and margins.\nThree Months Ended March 31, December 31, March 31, 2018 2017 2017 Yield on loans 5.58% 5.63% 5.27% Yield on interest-earning assets 5.34% 5.35% 5.01% Cost of interest-bearing liabilities 1.23% 1.08% 0.87% Cost of deposits 0.81% 0.70% 0.57% Cost of funds 0.83% 0.71% 0.57% Net interest spread 4.11% 4.27% 4.14% Net interest margin 4.56% 4.69% 4.47% The provision for loan losses for the first quarter of 2018 increased $253 thousand to $575 thousand from $322 thousand for the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to a $45.7 million or 6.1% increase in gross loans, net of unearned income, during the first quarter of 2018 and an increase of $1.3 million in classified loans. The provision for loan losses for the first quarter of 2018 increased $34 thousand compared to $541 thousand for the first quarter of 2017.\nNoninterest income for the first quarter of 2018 was $2.21 million, a decrease of $66 thousand, or 2.9%, from $2.28 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to a decrease in gain on sale of loans, partially offset by increases in loan servicing income and other service fees on deposits. Gain on sale of loans decreased $413 thousand to $989 thousand for the first quarter of 2018 from $1.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. We sold $13.4 million in SBA loans with an average premium of 8.66% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the sale of $18.6 million in SBA loans with an average premium of 9.35% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Loan servicing income, net of amortization, increased $255 thousand, due to a decrease in servicing assets amortization on SBA loan payoffs, and service charges on deposit accounts increased $82 thousand due to increased activities on noninterest bearing accounts.\nNoninterest income for the first quarter of 2018 decreased $32 thousand, or 1.4%, compared to $2.24 million for the first quarter of 2017, due to decreases in gain on sale of loans and loan servicing income, partially offset by increases in service charges on deposit accounts and trade finance fees. Gain on sale of loans decreased $204 thousand from $1.2 million for the first quarter of 2017. We sold $16.4 million in SBA loans with an average premium of 9.41% in the first quarter of 2017. Loan servicing income, net of amortization, decreased $42 thousand, primarily due to an increase in servicing assets amortization on SBA loan payoffs. Service charges on deposit accounts increased $117 thousand due to increased activities on noninterest bearing accounts, and trade finance fees increased $91 thousand to $153 thousand in the first quarter of 2018 from $62 thousand in the first quarter of 2017.\nNoninterest expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $6.8 million, an increase of $240 thousand, or 3.7%, compared to $6.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to $150 thousand increase in salary and employee benefits to support continued growth of the Company, and $127 thousand increase in foundation donation and other contributions, which was in line with the increase in net income for the first quarter of 2018.\nNoninterest expense for the first quarter of 2018 increased $422 thousand, or 6.6%, compared to $6.4 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to $187 thousand increase in salary and benefit, $114 thousand increase in foundation donation and other contributions and $63 thousand increase in occupancy and equipment expenses.\nOn December 22, 2017, H.R.1, commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), was signed into law, which among other items reduced the federal corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, effective January 1, 2018. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles required companies to re-measure certain tax-related assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment of the new legislation with resulting tax effects accounted for in the reporting period of enactment. The Company concluded that the enactment of the Tax Act caused its net deferred tax assets (“DTA”) to be re-measured at the new lower tax rate. The Company performed an analysis and determined the value of the net DTA should be reduced by $1.3 million, which was recognized as a one-time, incremental income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nIncome tax provision for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.2 million, compared to $3.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $1.4 million for the first quarter of 2017.
