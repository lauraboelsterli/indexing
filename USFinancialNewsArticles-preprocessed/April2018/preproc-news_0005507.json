The Company successfully closed the first tranche of the Private Placement on March 29, 2018 when 14,183,333 Units were issued from treasury at a subscription price of $0.28 per Unit for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $3,971,333. Members of the management team of the Company purchased Units in an aggregate amount of $1 million. Due to continued interest in the Private Placement, the Company expects to have a second and final closing of the Private Placement within the next 10 days or so, subject to the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals, including the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange.\nEach Unit is comprised of one common share (each, a “ Common Share ”) and one-half of one Common Share purchase warrant (each, a “ Warrant ”). Each whole Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one additional Common Share at an exercise price of $0.38 for a period of 24 months following the date of issue, subject to customary adjustment provisions.\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Private Placement for advancing the Company’s mineral exploration and development projects, and for general corporate purposes.\nIn connection with the Private Placement, the Company may pay a finder’s fee in cash, subject to all necessary regulatory approvals. All securities issued pursuant to the Private Placement will be subject to, among other things, a hold period of four months and one day in accordance with applicable securities laws.\nABOUT AMARILLO\nAmarillo is developing a highly economic, open pit gold resource at its Mara Rosa Project in the mining friendly jurisdiction of Goias State in Brazil. An Updated Pre-Feasibility Study (NI 43-101 technical report) for the Mara Rosa Project was filed on SEDAR on May 4, 2017. In addition, Amarillo has an advanced exploration project with excellent grades at Lavras do Sul, also in Brazil. A Mineral Resource Estimate Study (NI 43-101 technical report) for Lavras do Sul was filed on SEDAR on October 4, 2010. Both projects have excellent nearby infrastructure. The Mara Rosa Project was awarded the main permit (LP) that gives social and environment permission to mine. This has allowed Amarillo to move forward and work on the installation permit (LI) for the Mara Rosa Project.\nFor further information, please contact: Mike Mutchler or Karen Mate President & CEO Marketing Strategist 416-294-0736 416-230-6454 mike.mutchler@amarillogold.com karen.mate@amarillogold.com 32 Richmond St. East Suite 201 Toronto, ON Canada, M5C 1P1 Website: www.amarillogold.com Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS:\nThis news release contains Forward Looking Statements regarding the Company’s current expectations regarding future events, including with respect to the Company’s business, operations and condition, management’s objectives, strategies, beliefs and intentions, the completion of the Private Placement, the anticipated size and timing of closing of the Private Placement and the use of proceeds therefrom.
