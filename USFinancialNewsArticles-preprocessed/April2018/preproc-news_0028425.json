    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, April 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ScaleFT, the Zero Trust security company, today announced that Marc Rogers is joining the company as Chief Security Officer. Marc brings over 20 years of security industry expertise to the company. He has famously held the role of Head of Security for DEFCON, the world’s longest running hacker conference, since 1999. Most recently, Rogers served as Head of Information Security at CloudFlare, Inc., responsible for the global security of the compliance, product security, infrastructure security, and threat intelligence teams. He brings deep technical expertise to the ScaleFT mission of helping companies achieve their own BeyondCorp-inspired Zero Trust security architectures.\n“Marc has been incredibly valuable as an advisor and community advocate, and we are extremely excited to welcome him to ScaleFT,” said Jason Luce, CEO and co-founder of ScaleFT. “We share the same vision for security as a significant business enabler, with Zero Trust as the right model, and we look forward to his contributions to our fast-growing company.”\nRogers has been a prominent figure in the Information Security field for decades, where he is best known for his Whitehat hacking including Google Glass, Apple’s TouchID and most recently The Tesla Model S sports car. He has served on industry steering groups that include the Microsoft CISO council and the GSMA Security Group. He has also advised several TV networks including BBC, where he appeared on and advised the series, “The Real Hustle”, and most recently USA Network’s MR Robot where he designed hacks such as the Femtocell used for the finale in Season 2.\n“I have been incredibly impressed with how ScaleFT has brought the core principles of BeyondCorp to the market in such a positive and meaningful manner,” said Rogers. “It’s my strong belief that security should be seen as a business enabler, never a blocker, and ScaleFT is the company to bring that confidence to organizations of all size through its Zero Trust platform.”\nScaleFT is a leading provider of Zero Trust security solutions, offering products for controlling access to servers, services, and web applications. The ScaleFT platform is backed by its Access Fabric, a globally distributed, real-time authorization engine capable of making smarter trust decisions based on dynamic user and device conditions. ScaleFT is trusted by forward-thinking companies such as Coursera, Quid, and Rackspace.\n“ScaleFT is building the next generation of security solutions designed for the modern organization, where more employees work remotely from a wide range of devices, accessing applications and services in the cloud,” said Paul Querna, CTO and co-founder of ScaleFT. “Marc brings decades of industry experience to our company and product, where our core focus is solving real world security challenges the right way.”\nScaleFT will be hosting the BeyondCorp Community Lounge this Wednesday, April 18th from 9:00 AM - 4:00 PM PST at 111 Minna Gallery in San Francisco, CA. The event will feature a series of Q&As with security industry professionals focused on modern themes and practices. Along with special guests from Segment, Yelp, and more, Rogers will participate in a Q&A session centered on making security a business enabler.
