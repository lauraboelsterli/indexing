    "text": "1Q 2018 net income of $1.0 million, or $0.13 per diluted share versus 1Q 2017 net loss of ($4.9) million, or ($0.61) per diluted share Including adjusted items discussed below, 1Q 2018 adjusted net income was $1.1 million, or $0.14 per diluted share 1Q 2018 consolidated operating revenue increased 23.0% to $125.0 million from $101.7 million in 1Q 2017 Continued YoY improvement in base revenue per loaded mile, base revenue per available tractor per week, and average unseated tractor count\nVAN BUREN, Ark.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- USA Truck, Inc. (NASDAQ: USAK), a leading capacity solutions provider, today announced its financial results for the quarter .\nFor the quarter , consolidated operating revenue was $125.0 million compared to $101.7 million for the prior-year period. Base revenue, which excludes fuel surcharge, was $110.3 million compared to $89.8 million for the comparable 2017 period. The Company reported net income of $1.0 million, or $0.13 per diluted share for the first quarter 2018, compared to a net loss of ($4.9) million, or ($0.61) per diluted share, for the same quarter in 2017. The Company’s first quarter 2018 operating ratio was 98.1%, compared to 106.3% in the 2017 quarter.\nIncluded in earnings per diluted share for the quarter was approximately $0.7 million, or $0.07 per diluted share net-of-tax, of severance costs recorded in salaries, wages and employee benefits relating to the recently announced retirement of James Craig, the Company’s EVP, Chief Commercial Officer , and President – USAT Logistics. The quarter also included a $0.6 million, or $0.06 per diluted share net-of-tax, benefit for the reversal of restructuring, impairment and other costs relating to the reopening of our Trucking maintenance facility in South Holland, IL, which was closed in 2016.\nPresident and CEO James Reed commented, “USA Truck continued its momentum in 2018 by delivering the third consecutive quarter of positive EPS since bringing our team together, and only the second positive first quarter EPS result in the last 11 years. While we benefited in the quarter from a tightening capacity environment and strong underlying economic drivers, we also experienced unusually challenging weather, an increasingly difficult driver recruiting environment, rising fuel prices, and correspondingly tight asset light capacity. We continued to deliver improved operational and financial results throughout the quarter, and believe the progress in our rate, revenue, and profit measures has outpaced market forces. This is a testament to our team’s commitment to become one of the best performing companies in our sector. While we are pleased with our team’s progress, we still feel that we have a long way to go.”\nTrucking: For 2018, Trucking operating revenue increased $8.5 million, or 12.0%, to $78.7 million, compared to 2017. This increase was primarily due to a 15.5% increase in base revenue per loaded mile. Trucking operating loss was ($0.5) million for the 2018 period, reflecting an operating ratio of 100.6%, compared to a ($7.1) million operating loss and an operating ratio of 110.1% for the 2017 period. This represents a $6.7 million year-over-year improvement in operating income and a 950 basis point improvement in operating ratio.\nContinued improvement in our Trucking operations and profitability will, we believe, come through the focus on the following areas, which have already shown the improvement noted below:\nBase revenue per loaded mile increased 15.5% to $2.009 for first quarter 2018 from $1.740 in first quarter 2017. Base revenue per available tractor per week increased $371 per week, or 12.9%, when compared to 2017, and declined $171 per week, or 5% sequentially over the fourth quarter of 2017. Loaded miles per available tractor per week decreased 36 miles per tractor, or 2.2%, when compared to 2017, and decreased 6 miles per tractor, or 0.4%, sequentially over the fourth quarter of 2017. Deadhead percentage for first quarter 2018 decreased 50 basis points year-over-year and 100 basis points sequentially over the fourth quarter of 2017. Average unseated tractor percentage for first quarter 2018 was 7.3%, which represents improvement of 100 basis points year-over-year and an unfavorable increase of 170 basis points sequentially over the fourth quarter of 2017. The average seated tractor count for 2018 was 1,534, which represented a 1.9% decrease compared to our first quarter 2017 average of 1,563.\nUSAT Logistics: Operating revenue increased 47.4%, or $14.9 million year-over-year to $46.3 million for 2018, and increased 17.2%, or $6.8 million sequentially over fourth quarter 2017. Operating income increased $2.1 million, or 291.8% year-over-year and $0.9 million, or 43.1% sequentially. The year-over-year change in operating income was the result of a 45.3% increase in revenue per load combined with a 1.5% increase in load volume. As previously reported, we have recently hired a new leader of this segment and we believe that this change will help us accelerate the momentum of growth and profitability improvement.\nGross margin percentage for 2018, decreased slightly to 17.0% from 17.1% when compared to the same quarter in 2017, and decreased 90 basis points sequentially from 17.9% for the fourth quarter of 2017. Revenue per load increased 45.3%, or $544 per load, year-over-year, and 5.8%, or $95 per load, over fourth quarter of 2017.\nSegment Results\nThe following table includes key operating results and statistics by reportable segment:\nThree Months Ended March 31, Trucking: 2018 2017 Operating revenue (in thousands) $ 78,733 $ 70,280 Operating loss (in thousands) (1) $ (464) $ (7,128) Operating ratio (2) 100.6 % 110.1 % Adjusted operating ratio (3) 100.8 % 110.7 % Total miles (in thousands) (4) 38,542 40,449 Deadhead percentage (5) 12.7 % 13.2 % Base revenue per loaded mile $ 2.009 $ 1.740 Average number of seated tractors (6) 1,534 1,563 Average number of available tractors (7) 1,619 1,653 Average number of in-service tractors (8) 1,654 1,704 Loaded miles per available tractor per week 1,616 1,652 Base revenue per available tractor per week $ 3,246 $ 2,875 Average loaded miles per trip 539 579 USAT Logistics: Operating revenue (in thousands) $ 46,280 $ 31,390 Operating income (in thousands) (1) 2,856 729 Gross margin (in thousands) (9) 7,884 5,359 Gross margin percentage (10) 17.0 % 17.1 % (1) Operating income (loss) is calculated by deducting operating expenses from operating revenue.

The terms base revenue, “Net Debt”, “EBITDA”, “Adjusted EBITDA”, “Adjusted operating ratio”, “Adjusted net income”, and “Adjusted earnings (loss) per diluted share”, as we define them, are not presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company defines Net Debt as total debt, including insurance premium financing and capital lease obligations, net of cash. The Company defines EBITDA as net income (loss), plus interest expense net of interest income, provision for income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus non-cash equity compensation, restructuring, impairment and other costs, and severance costs included in salaries, wages and employee benefits. Adjusted operating ratio is calculated as operating expenses less restructuring, impairment and other costs and severance costs included in salaries, wages and employee benefits, net of fuel surcharge revenue, as a percentage of operating revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue. Adjusted net income is defined as net income (loss) less restructuring, impairment and other costs and severance costs included in salaries, wages and employee benefits. Adjusted earnings (loss) per diluted share is defined as earnings (loss) per share plus the per-share impact of restructuring, impairment and other costs, and severance costs included in salaries, wages and employee benefits, plus or minus the per share tax impact of those adjustments using a statutory income tax rate. The per-share impact of each item is determined by dividing it by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding. These financial measures supplement our GAAP results in evaluating certain aspects of our business. We believe that using these measures improves comparability in analyzing our performance because they remove the impact of items from our operating results that, in our opinion, do not reflect our core operating performance. Management and the board of directors focus on Net Debt, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted operating ratio, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted earnings (loss) per diluted share as key measures of our performance, all of which are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measures and further discussed below. We believe our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors and other users because it provides them the same information that we use internally for purposes of assessing our core operating performance.\nNet Debt, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted operating ratio, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted earnings (loss) per diluted share are not substitutes for their comparable GAAP financial measures, such as net income, cash flows from operating activities, operating margin ratio, diluted earnings per share, or other measures prescribed by GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. Although we believe that they improve comparability in analyzing our period to period performance, they could limit comparability to other companies in our industry if those companies define these measures differently. Because of these limitations, our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered measures of income generated by our business or discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures on a supplemental basis.\nPursuant to the requirements of Regulation G and Regulation S-K, we have provided reconciliations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted operating ratio, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted earnings (loss) per diluted share to GAAP financial measures at the end of this press release.\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nFinancial information in this press release is preliminary and based upon information available to the Company as of the date of this press release.
