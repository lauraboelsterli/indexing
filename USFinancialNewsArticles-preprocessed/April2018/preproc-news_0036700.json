    "text": "ROME (Reuters) - Italian President Sergio Mattarella summoned Senate speaker Maria Casellati for a meeting on Wednesday where he is expected to ask her to mediate with political parties to see if they can reach agreement on the formation of a new government.\nFILE PHOTO: The newly elected Senate President Maria Elisabetta Alberti Casellati leaves after the meeting with the Italian President Sergio Mattarella at the Quirinal Palace in Rome, Italy, April 4, 2018. REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi/File Photo A statement from the presidential palace said Casellati, a member of the center-right Forza Italia party, would meet the head of state at 1100 a.m. (5 a.m. ET).\nHe will likely ask her to try to break a deadlock that has prevented the formation of a government since inconclusive elections on March 4.\nFILE PHOTO: Italian President Sergio Mattarella arrives to speak to the media at the Quirinal Palace in Rome, Italy, April 13, 2018. REUTERS/Tony Gentile Political sources have said Casellati would then hold more flexible, less formal consultations with political leaders than those Mattarella has already held.\nThe European Unionâ€™s third-largest economy has been under a caretaker government since the election, when anti-establishment and far-right parties were the big winners at the expense of more mainstream groups.\nTwo rounds of formal consultations have failed to overcome seemingly irreconcilable positions, and the stalemate is likely to persist until regional elections later this month, according to political sources.\nReporting By Philip Pullella\n ",
