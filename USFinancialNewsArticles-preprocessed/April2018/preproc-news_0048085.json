FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Turkish Cup - Semi Final - Fenerbahce v Besiktas - Sukru Saracoglu Stadium, Istanbul, Turkey - April 19, 2018 - Besiktas coach Senol Gunes holds his head after being hit by an object. REUTERS/Kemal Aslan\nThe Turkish Cup semi-final between two of the country’s biggest teams was abandoned on Thursday after Besiktas manager Senol Gunes was hit on the head by an object thrown by Fenerbahce fans.\nThe game, which was 0-0 before it was halted, will be resumed from 57th minute on Thursday, May 3.\nMore than 30 people were detained during the past week with alleged links to the incident.\nThe game between the long-time Istanbul rivals started in a tense atmosphere and Besiktas were reduced to 10 men after former Real Madrid defender Pepe was sent off for a reckless tackle.\nTensions increased when fans threw objects at a Besiktas player as a corner was taken. Besiktas players then left the pitch along with the officials and the game was later abandoned. Writing by Ece Toksabay; Editing by Christian Radnedge",
