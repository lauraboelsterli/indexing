    "text": "TOKYO, April 17 (Reuters) - Japanese shares were flat on Tuesday morning as investors turned cautious ahead of a meeting between Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. President Donald Trump in which Tokyo fears the latter may link vital security matters with touchy trade topics.\nThe market is unlikely to move sharply either way throughout the day as investors await the outcome of the two-day summit that starts on Tuesday, traders said.\nThe Nikkei share average was trading at 21,837.39 at the midday break. The broader Topix fell 0.2 percent to 1,732.39, with 25 of its 33 sub-sectors falling.\nShares of food companies gained, with NH Foods rising 1.5 percent and Ajinomoto gaining 0.8 percent.\nFinancial stocks underperformed, with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group falling 1.2 percent and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group shedding 1.4 percent. Nomura Holdings lost 1.2 percent while MS&AD Insurance declined 1.4 percent.\nTakeda Pharmaceutical Co soared 1.8 percent after Shire, which faces a potential bid from Takeda, said it would sell its oncology business to unlisted French drugmaker Servier for $2.4 billion.
