FILE PHOTO: A welding robot creates sparks during the body shell production of a Ford Fiesta at the Ford assembly line in Cologne, Germany, September 12, 2013. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay/File Photo \nContracts for ‘Made in Germany’ goods rose by 0.3 percent after falling by an upwardly revised 3.5 percent in January, data from the Economy Ministry showed. \nThe reading undershot a Reuters poll of analysts who had predicted a 1.5 percent increase. \n“Despite the subdued demand so far this year orders should remain on an upward course,” the economy ministry said in a statement. “The global economy remains in upswing which should keep demand for German industrial goods on a high level.” Reporting by Joseph Nasr; Editing by Caroline Copley",
