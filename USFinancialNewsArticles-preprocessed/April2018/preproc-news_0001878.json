    "text": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., April 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Ocean Bio-Chem, Inc. (NASDAQ: OBCI) announced its full year and fourth quarter 2017 financial results.\nThe Company's 2017 net income was approximately $2.6 million, compared to 2016 net income of $2.1 million, an increase of approximately $5 million or 24%. Earnings per share for 2017 were $0.28 compared to $0.23 for 2016, an increase of approximately 22%.\nThe Company also reported record 2017 net sales of approximately $38.9 million, compared to approximately $36.2 million for 2016, an increase of approximately $2.7 million or 7.5%. The Company's 2017 net sales marked the fifth consecutive year in which the Company achieved record net sales.\nFourth quarter 2017 net sales were approximately $9.0 million, compared to fourth quarter 2016 net sales of approximately $8.5 million, an increase of approximately $500,000 or 5.4%. The Company's fourth quarter 2017 net sales marked the seventh consecutive year in which the Company achieved record fourth quarter net sales.\nFourth quarter 2017 net income was approximately $293,000 compared to approximately $451,000 in 2016, a decrease of approximately $160,000. Fourth quarter net income reflected an approximately $188,000 non-cash write from an accounts receivable balance relating to a customer that filed for bankruptcy, as well as increased advertising and promotion expenses and higher manufacturing costs. These factors were offset in part by a decrease in the Company's provision for income taxes, reflecting the reduction of its U.S. corporate income tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and, as a result, its revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities. Earnings per share for fourth quarter 2017 was $0.03 compared to $0.05 for 2016.\n(In thousands, except per share data)\n(000's Omitted)\nThree Months\nEnded\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNET SALES\n$8,987\n$8,523\n$38,933\n$36,205\nPRE-TAX INCOME\n$278\n$698\n$3,678\n$3,078\nNET INCOME\n$293\n$451\n$2,604\n$2,095\nEPS BASIC & DILUTED\n$.03\n$.05\n$0.28\n$0.23\nDIVIDEND DECLARED PER COMMON SHARE\n$0.06\n$0.06\nPeter Dornau, President and CEO commented: \"Despite the challenges faced by many brick and mortar retailers, Ocean Bio-Chem continued to increase sales in a variety of retail channels, enabling us to realize record net sales in 2017. For example, we saw increased sales into the U.S. marine specialty retail sector, with both branded and private label products along with strong sales increases into the hardware and online channels.\"\nMr. Dornau continued: \"We continue to increase sales of our Odor Star ® / Performacide ® product line, including both branded and private label products. As previously reported, we recently have been approved by a large national mass transit railroad company to supply Performacide ® for the sanitizing of their entire fleet of railroad cars. Implementation of this program started in the first quarter of 2018, and is expected to continue over the next twelve months. In addition, a national automotive retail chain of approximately 5,000 stores initiated placement of our Performacide ® /NosGUARD SG Auto Odor Eliminator ® gas release products on its store shelves in the first quarter of 2018.\nMr. Dornau continued: \"The 84,000-sq. ft. expansion of our manufacturing and distribution facilities in Montgomery Alabama is nearing completion. We anticipate that the expanded facility will be operational in the second quarter of 2018, and will support the continued growth of our Company.\nMr. Dornau concluded: \"We remain cautiously optimistic that the strong sales trends of 2017 will continue. We increased our advertising efforts with our customers in addition to general advertising and promotions in anticipation of our growth, which affected our fourth quarter 2017 results. We believe that these expenditures represent a worthwhile investment that will benefit our company in 2018.\"\nAs previously announced, the Company has declared a special cash dividend of $0.06 per share, payable on April 16, 2018 to common shareholders of record on April 2, 2018.\nAbout Ocean Bio-Chem, Inc.:\nOcean Bio-Chem, Inc. manufactures, markets and distributes a broad line of appearance and maintenance products for the marine, automotive, power sports, recreational vehicle and outdoor power equipment markets under the Star brite ® , Star Tron ® , Odor Star ® and other brand names within the United States of America and Canada.
