    "text": "BARCELONA (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of Catalan independence supporters flooded the streets of Barcelona on Sunday calling for the release of jailed separatist leaders after a supreme court ruling frustrated their latest attempt to elect a regional leader.\nAround 350,000 demonstrators clogged several main city arteries waving flags and wearing yellow in support of separatist leaders jailed for their role in the regionâ€™s banned drive to split from Spain last year.\nAmong the politicians facing charges of rebellion is Jordi Sanchez, the latest candidate put forward by Catalan lawmakers to become leader of the region.\nSupreme court judge Pablo Llarena refused last week to release him from jail and he faces up to 25 years on charges of rebellion, marking the latest of four unsuccessful attempts to elect a new leader.\nIf a new leader is not named before the end of May, Catalonia will be forced to call another election.\nSlideshow (4 Images) Reporting by Sam Edwards; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ",
