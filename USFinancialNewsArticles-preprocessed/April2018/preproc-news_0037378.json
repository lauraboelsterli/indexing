    "text": "April 18 (Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox Inc, which has agreed to sell most of its assets to Walt Disney Co , rejected a deal with another entity that a source identified as Comcast Corp due to higher regulatory risks.\nDisney, in a filing here with regulators on Wednesday, disclosed Fox's reasons for rejecting the rival offer without disclosing the bidder.\nComcast had abandoned its bid to buy most of the assets of Rupert Murdoch’s Fox.\nDisney announced the $52.4 billion deal for Fox’s film and TV assets in December.
