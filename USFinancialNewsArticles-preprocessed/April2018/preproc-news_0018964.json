The pricing environment also continued to improve, and we implemented a moderate price increase in late January. As a result, we delivered improved gross margins, which along with productivity, resulted in strong incremental margins. We remain focused on growing technical and high-touch areas to create a deeper moat around our business, and while I am pleased with our progress, we have room for further improvement. Strengthening market demand and a better pricing environment, coupled with a continuing focus on driving productivity and our decision to begin growing our sales force, bode well for an even better future.\"\nRustom Jilla, executive vice president and chief financial officer, added, \"Our reported fiscal second quarter average daily sales rose 9.3%, gross margin was 43.9%, operating expenses to sales improved to 31.1%, and operating income rose 13.2%. Excluding the impact of the DECO acquisition, our organic average daily sales growth was 5.0%, our gross margin was flat with the prior year, our operating expenses to sales ratio improved by 90 basis points, and operating income rose 12.8%, demonstrating strong leverage.* We also had another quarter of solid cash generation, with year to date net cash from operations up 22% on the prior year. During the quarter, we repurchased shares and paid out a dividend of 58 cents per share, up 29% from the prior year, indicative of our commitment to allocating capital to enhance total shareholder returns.\"\n* An explanation and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is presented in schedules following this press release\nOutlook\nThe Company expects net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to be between $820 million and $835 million.

(\"DECO\") on July 31, 2017. These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude, for the thirteen and twenty-six-week periods ended March 3, 2018, the net estimated impact of the TCJA passed in December 2017, as these items will significantly impact comparability between years. This provisional benefit is an estimate subject to adjustment during a 12-month measurement period.\nThese non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We believe that these non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect MSC's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP, and that these measures should only be used to evaluate MSC's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measures. We compensate for the limitations of non-GAAP financial measures by relying upon GAAP results to gain a complete picture of the Company's performance.\nIn calculating non-GAAP financial measures, we exclude the results of DECO and the tax benefits attributable to the TCJA to facilitate a review of the Company's operating performance on a period-to-period basis, for comparison with forecasts and strategic plans, and for benchmarking performance externally against competitors. We believe that investors benefit from seeing results \"through the eyes\" of management in addition to seeing GAAP results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when read in conjunction with the Company's GAAP financials, provide useful information to investors by offering:\nthe ability to make more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the Company's on-going operating results; the ability to better identify trends in the Company's underlying business and perform related trend analyses; a better understanding of how management plans and measures the Company's underlying business; and an easier way to compare the Company's operating results against analyst financial models and operating results of competitors that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures\nMSC INDUSTRIAL SUPPLY CO.
