    "text": "New CCO to lead TaskUs customer support vision\nLOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TaskUs, a leader in customer experience for hyper-growth technology companies, is delivering on its customer-first promise with the appointment of Jarrod Johnson to the newly created position of Chief Customer Officer. Johnson will lead the company’s client facing functions to ensure it provides an innovative and differentiated end-to-end customer experience. Johnson’s role manages marketing, sales, client services and consulting divisions, to respond to the rapidly evolving needs of TaskUs’ customers as well as its customers’ customers.\n“Jarrod is a client advocate and brings the entire customer journey to the forefront, unifying cross-functional teams to understand the customers’ needs deeply, anticipate potential challenges and drive client satisfaction,” said CEO Bryce Maddock. “Jarrod has the confidence of the entire organization behind him.”\nTaskUs is a leader in “next-gen” customer service. Companies with high-growth business models that disrupted their industries must also disrupt the traditional customer service model. This means not only communicating with customers where they are, in-app, on social channels or elsewhere, but also ensuring a response time that exceeds expectation in a social media environment that moves at the speed of a tweet.\nAs SVP of Sales, Johnson led TaskUs in expanding its client base by adding 20 new clients. Johnson’s contributions were essential to TaskUs’ launch into new markets in the U.S. and Mexico. Based in TaskUs’ Dallas office, Johnson works closely with the company founders, CEO Bryce Maddock and President Jaspar Weir, who both live in Austin and oversee TaskUs’ largest on-shore facility.\n“Today’s business disruptors need a different kind of customer service – and a different kind of partner - than legacy big-name consumer brands,” said Johnson. “TaskUs works well with hyper-growth companies because we sense and respond to a fast-moving market. We are cloud based and digital first, with a phenomenal employee centric culture, just like these brands want and need to be.”\nBefore joining the TaskUs team, Johnson served as Group President of Retail and Consumer Brand technology services globally for ACS, a Xerox company. Johnson spent ten years at IBM in ecommerce consulting, retail/consumer products technology, and client management specializing in large services engagements. Johnson earned his Master of Business Administration from the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University.\nAbout TaskUs\nTaskUs provides next generation customer experience that powers the world's most disruptive companies through the partnership of amazing people and innovative technology.\nWe provide Ridiculously Good strategy and business process outsourcing utilizing revolutionary technology and the best talent to deliver transformational, digital scale.
