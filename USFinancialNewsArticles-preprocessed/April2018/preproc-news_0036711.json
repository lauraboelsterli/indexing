    "text": "Shares of Roku plunged more than 8 percent Wednesday after Amazon and Best Buy announced plans to team up to sell smart TVs.\nUnder the deal, Best Buy will become one of the only brick-and-mortar retailers where customers can walk in and buy a TV powered by Amazon's Fire TV software. The TVs will also be sold on Best Buy's website. In exchange, Best Buy will be a third-party seller on Amazon.com, giving the retailer access to Amazon's vast customer network. \nSource: CNBC Anthony Wood Shares of streaming device maker Roku were previously on a tear this week. The company announced on Monday its media streaming device would offer access to ESPN+ , allowing users to stream Disney 's sports content for $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year. Shares continued climbing Tuesday, after Steven Cohen's Point72 Asset Management took a 5.1 percent passive stake in the company.\nWednesday's losses virtually wiped out Roku's recent gains. Shares of Roku are down 36 percent this year.\n--The Associated Press contributed to this report.",
