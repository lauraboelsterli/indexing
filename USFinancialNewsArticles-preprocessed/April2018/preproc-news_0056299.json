    "text": "Increases Fiscal 2018 Revenue Expectations\nRaises Fiscal 2018 Estimated EPS Range\nDeclares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.24 Per Share\nOSHKOSH, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Oshkosh Corporation (NYSE: OSK) today reported fiscal 2018 second quarter net income of $110.8 million, or $1.47 per diluted share, compared to $44.3 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 included after-tax charges and inefficiencies of $5.8 million associated with restructuring actions in the access equipment and commercial segments. Results for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 included after-tax charges of $13.7 million associated with restructuring actions in the access equipment segment. Excluding these charges and inefficiencies, adjusted 1 net income was $116.6 million, or $1.54 per diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $58.0 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Comparisons in this news release are to the corresponding period of the prior year, unless otherwise noted.\nConsolidated net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were $1.89 billion, an increase of 16.6 percent compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The Company reported double-digit percentage sales growth in all non-defense segments.\nConsolidated operating income increased 93.9 percent to $155.9 million, or 8.3 percent of sales, in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $80.4 million, or 5.0 percent of sales, in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in operating income in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was primarily a result of the impact of higher consolidated sales volume, improved performance in the fire & emergency segment and lower costs related to restructuring actions. Excluding $7.0 million of pre-tax charges and inefficiencies related to restructuring actions in the access equipment and commercial segments, adjusted 1 operating income in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $162.9 million or 8.6 percent of sales. Excluding $17.2 million of pre-tax restructuring-related charges in the access equipment segment, adjusted 1 operating income in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was $97.6 million, or 6.0 percent of sales.\n“We are pleased to report another quarter of solid results highlighted by growth in revenue, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share,” said Wilson R. Jones, president and chief executive officer of Oshkosh Corporation. “We continued to benefit in the quarter from a positive economic environment in the United States and strong demand globally for our products. We are also experiencing some challenges related to the positive economic environment, including a tight labor market, a more constrained supply chain and higher logistics and material costs. We are proactively addressing these headwinds, including implementing steel and aluminum surcharges in our non-defense segments.\n“During the quarter, our defense segment was awarded the U.S. Army’s FMTV A2 contract providing our team with another tactical wheeled vehicle program of record and solidifying our position as the United States’ premier manufacturer of world class military vehicles. This award gives us visibility to supply the United States military with these impressive medium payload vehicles well into the next decade.\n“As a result of our solid second quarter performance and our positive outlook for the remainder of the year, we are raising our full-year fiscal 2018 earnings per share estimate range to $5.10 to $5.55 and our adjusted 1 earnings per share estimate range to $5.40 to $5.85,” said Jones.\nFactors affecting second quarter results for the Company’s business segments included:\nAccess Equipment - Access equipment segment net sales increased 28.3 percent to $927.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase in sales was due to improved demand for both aerial work platforms and telehandlers. All regions reported double digit increases in sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nAccess equipment segment operating income increased 132.1 percent to $97.7 million, or 10.5 percent of sales, in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $42.1 million, or 5.8 percent of sales, in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Access equipment segment results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 included pre-tax charges and inefficiencies associated with previously announced restructuring actions of $5.2 million. Access equipment segment results for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 included pre-tax charges associated with previously announced restructuring actions of $17.2 million. Excluding these charges and inefficiencies, adjusted 1 operating income was $102.9 million, or 11.1 percent of sales, in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $59.3 million, or 8.2 percent of sales, in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in adjusted 1 operating income in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the impact of higher sales volume, the recognition of deferred margin upon the receipt of cash and improved price realization, offset in part by challenges associated with the ramp up to higher production volumes.\nDefense - Defense segment net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased 4.0 percent to $428.2 million. The decrease in sales was due to the absence of international Mine Resistant Ambush Protected-All Terrain Vehicle (M-ATV) sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, largely offset by the continued ramp up of sales to the U.S. government under the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) program.\nDefense segment operating income decreased 1.8 percent to $47.8 million, or 11.2 percent of sales, in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $48.7 million, or 10.9 percent of sales, in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The decrease in operating income was due to the impact of lower sales volume and an adverse product mix, offset in part by improved manufacturing performance.\nFire & Emergency - Fire & emergency segment net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 15.0 percent to $273.1 million. The increase in sales was due to higher fire apparatus sales and improved pricing.\nFire & emergency segment operating income increased 65.1 percent to $36.0 million, or 13.2 percent of sales, in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $21.8 million, or 9.2 percent of sales, in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in operating income was a result of improved pricing, the impact of higher sales volume and improved manufacturing performance, offset in part by higher selling, general and administrative expenses.\nCommercial - Commercial segment net sales increased 22.2 percent to $263.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase in sales was primarily due to higher refuse collection vehicle unit volume.\nCommercial segment operating income increased 173.3 percent to $16.4 million, or 6.2 percent of sales, in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $6.0 million, or 2.8 percent of sales, in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Excluding restructuring-related charges of $1.8 million, adjusted 1 operating income in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $18.2 million, or 6.9 percent of sales. The increase in operating income was largely a result of the impact of higher sales volume, improved product mix and lower warranty costs. Commercial segment second quarter fiscal 2017 results included $1.3 million of costs related to an accident at one of its manufacturing facilities.\nCorporate - Corporate operating costs increased $3.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 to $42.0 million due primarily to higher incentive compensation costs on higher earnings and higher new product development spending.\nInterest Expense Net of Interest Income - Interest expense net of interest income decreased $6.1 million to $8.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily due to the receipt of interest from a customer that had been on non-accrual status.\nProvision for Income Taxes - The Company recorded income tax expense of $36.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, or 24.6 percent of pre-tax income, compared to $23.6 million, or 35.0 percent of pre-tax income, in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The decrease in the Company's effective income tax rate is primarily due to tax reform enacted in the United States. The Company recorded $1.1 million and $1.5 million of discrete tax benefits in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, largely related to favorable share-based compensation tax benefits.\nShare Repurchases - The Company deployed cash of $65.0 million to repurchase 839,013 shares of Common Stock in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Share repurchases did not have a material impact on earnings per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.\nSix-month Results\nThe Company reported net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2018 of $3.47 billion and net income of $167.2 million, or $2.21 per diluted share. This compares with net sales of $2.83 billion and net income of $63.5 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, in the first six months of the prior year. Results for the first six months of fiscal 2018 included after-tax charges and inefficiencies of $19.9 million associated with restructuring actions in the access equipment and commercial segments as well as one-time discrete tax benefits of $6.5 million related to the implementation of tax reform in the United States. Excluding these items, adjusted 1 net income for the first six months of fiscal 2018 was $180.6 million or $2.38 per diluted share. Results for the first six months of fiscal 2017 included $13.7 million of after-tax restructuring-related charges in the access equipment segment. Excluding this item, adjusted 1 net income for the first six months of fiscal 2017 was $77.2 million, or $1.02 per diluted share. The impact of higher consolidated sales, improved performance in the defense and fire & emergency segments and a lower effective tax rate as a result of tax reform in the United States contributed to the significant improvement in net income for the first six months of fiscal 2018 compared to the first six months of fiscal 2017.\nFiscal 2018 Expectations\nAs a result of the combined impacts of the positive second quarter results, improved demand outlook for access equipment sales, challenges related to the ramp up in production in the access equipment segment and material cost increases, the Company is raising its fiscal 2018 full year outlook. The Company now expects consolidated sales to be $7.4 billion to $7.6 billion, an increase of $300 million from the Company’s previous sales estimate range of $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion. All of the increase in expected sales is attributable to the access equipment segment.\nThe Company now expects its fiscal 2018 consolidated operating income to be $540 million to $590 million. Excluding anticipated charges and inefficiencies associated with announced restructuring actions in the access equipment and commercial segments, the Company expects its fiscal 2018 adjusted 1 operating income to be $575 million to $625 million, compared to its previous estimated adjusted operating income range of $550 million to $600 million. The increase is attributable to expected higher sales in the access equipment segment and improved margins in the defense and fire & emergency segments, offset in part by expected lower margins in the access equipment segment.\nThe Company now expects its fiscal 2018 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.10 to $5.55. Excluding anticipated charges and inefficiencies associated with announced restructuring actions in the access equipment and commercial segments as well as the impact of one-time discrete items associated with tax reform in the U.S., the Company expects its fiscal 2018 adjusted 1 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.40 to $5.85, compared to the prior adjusted diluted earnings per share estimated range of $5.00 to $5.45.\nDividend Announcement\nThe Company’s Board of Directors today declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share of Common Stock. The dividend will be payable on May 29, 2018, to shareholders of record as of May 14, 2018.\nConference Call\nThe Company will comment on its fiscal 2018 second quarter earnings and its full-year fiscal 2018 outlook during a conference call at 9:00 a.m. EDT this morning.
