    "text": "NEW YORK, April 16 (Reuters) - Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin said on Monday he was dropping his exploratory campaign for the governor’s race in order to remain focused on helping the financially stressed city he leads.\nThe Democrat said in a statement that after four months traveling the state in a run-up for a potential gubernatorial campaign, he kept his commitment to Hartford “at the forefront of my mind.”\n“After thinking hard and wrestling with this decision, I have decided to end my exploratory committee and stay focused on my work as Mayor,” he said.\nConnecticut Democrats will hold their primary elections in August ahead of November’s general election.\nBronin’s announcement comes as he prepares to submit his proposed fiscal 2019 budget later on Monday, and after two recent super-upgrades of the city’s general obligation debt from Wall Street agencies S&P Global Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service.\nThe rating hikes came after final approval of a deal for the state of Connecticut to take over payment of Hartford’s roughly $540 million of debt.\nThe bailout, which came with state oversight and was approved by the legislature, helped Hartford, the state capital, avoid the need to file for bankruptcy.\nBut the deal has faced threats from Republican lawmakers, who said the agreement opens the door for other struggling Connecticut cities to seek similar deals.\nRepublican leaders in the state House and Senate said they would try to strip other municipal aid from the state to Hartford.\n“I don’t want anyone to undermine our city as a way of getting at me,” Bronin said in Monday’s statement. “I cannot let Hartford’s future become the casualty of a political fight.” (Reporting by Hilary Russ Editing by Tom Brown)\n ",
