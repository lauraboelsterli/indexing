    "text": "NEW YORK, April 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department is expected to increase the amount of debt it would sell at its May refunding in an effort to raise more cash to make up for a growing budget deficit, TD Securities strategists said on Thursday.\nThe Treasury may ponder whether to roll out new debt maturities to fund its operations and obligations. It may offer “relatively soon” a two-month bill issue, and could discuss the possibility of a one-year floating-rate note and might reopen a discussion about a 20-year bond, TD Securities’ senior U.S. rates strategist Gennadiy Goldberg and head of global rates strategist Priya Misra wrote in a research note.
