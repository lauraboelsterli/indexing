    "text": "Ryan Braun hit a three-run, two-out, two-strike homer off Padres closer Brad Hand to cap a five-run, ninth-inning Milwaukee rally Friday night to give the Brewers an 8-6 victory over the Padres at Petco Park.\nAlthough he was only 1-for-4, Braun had five RBIs in the game on a first-inning ground out, a fifth-inning sacrifice fly and the game-winning homer.\nThe loss snapped a streak of 127 straight wins for the Padres when they took a lead into the ninth inning at Petco Park.\nThe Padres were leading 6-3 behind an offense led by back-to-back homers by Cory Spangenberg and Austin Hedges off former Padre Jhoulys Chacin.\nManny Pina and pinch-hitter Jesus Aguilar opened the ninth with back-to-back singles and the Brewers loaded the bases when Hand failed to field a come-backer for an error. Jonathan Viller singled home Pina and Aguilar scored on a ground out by Lorenzo Cain.\nThe Padres got a brief respite when first baseman Eric Hosmer threw out Orlando Arcia at the plate for the second out.\nBut Braun then lined a 0 -2 pitch from Hand 396 feet into the second deck in left.\nReliever Oliver Drake was credited for the win (1-0). Corey Knebel got the save (1). Hand took the loss (0-1).\nChacin, who had a 9-4 record and a 1.79 earned run average for the Padres in 16 starts at Petco Park last year, gave up four runs on seven hits (including the two homers) Friday night.\nMeantime, Padres left-handed starter Joey Lucchesi allowed three runs on seven hits in 4 2/3 innings in his Major League debut.\nMilwaukee took a 2-0 lead in the first against Lucchesi on a double by Cain, a single by Travis Shaw and a double by Domingo Santana.\nThe Padres struck for three in the bottom of the second. Freddy Galvis opened the inning with a single ahead of the homers by Spangenberg and Hedges, who had gone 0-for-24 to start the 2017 season.\nMargot extended the lead to 4-2 in the fourth with a one-out RBI single. Milwaukee cut the lead to 4-3 in the fifth when Cain opened the inning with his second double of the game and scored on Braun’s sacrifice fly.\nCarlos Asuaje returned the Padres to a two-run lead in the seventh with a two-out RBI double that scored Matt Szczur, who pinch-ran for Wil Myers. The Padres scored their final run in the eighth on a two-out RBI double by Hosmer.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
