    "text": "April 2, 2018 / 5:21 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Libyan forces launch operation against Islamic State Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nTRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libya’s internationally recognised government launched a military operation on Monday against remnants of the Islamic State group, it said. \nLocal forces aligned with the Government of National Accord (GNA) ousted Islamic State from its stronghold in the city of Sirte in late 2016, helped by U.S. air strikes, but Libyan officials say it retained a presence in desert camps and sleeper cells in western Libyan towns and cities. \n“At dawn today, Monday, a military operation under the name of Storm of the Homeland was launched that aims to pursue the remnants of Daesh (Islamic State) terrorist organisation,” said Mohamed al-Sallak, spokesman for Fayez Seraj, prime minister of the GNA. \nThe operation is being carried out by counter-terrorism forces in an area from 60 km (40 miles) east of the city of Misrata to the outskirts of five other towns: Bani Walid, Tarhouna, Msallata, Al-Khoms, and Zliten. \nHe gave no further details. \nThe GNA has limited authority over military forces and armed groups in western Libya. The east of the country is controlled by separate forces under military commander Khalifa Haftar. \nIslamic State has claimed responsibility for occasional attacks in recent months and continues to be targeted by sporadic U.S. air strikes in desert areas.
