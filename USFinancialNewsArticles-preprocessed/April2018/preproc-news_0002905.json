    "text": "April 4, 2018 / 4:42 AM / Updated an hour ago Injured Lallana could return before end of season - Klopp Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Liverpool midfielder Adam Lallana’s hamstring injury is not as bad as initially feared and he could still play before the end of the season, manager Juergen Klopp has said. Soccer Football - Premier League - Crystal Palace vs Liverpool - Selhurst Park, London, Britain - March 31, 2018 Liverpool's Adam Lallana receives medical attention after sustaining an injury Action Images via Reuters/Matthew Childs \nLallana suffered the latest injury setback after coming on as substitute in Liverpool’s 2-1 Premier League victory over Crystal Palace on Saturday. \n\"Thank God, that's not as bad as we thought - a number of weeks,\" Klopp told the club website www.liverpoolfc.com . \n“There is a little hope, of course, that we can maybe use him again this season but we have to wait; it is absolutely not the time to bring any rush into the situation. \n“It is not the Adam Lallana season so far. It makes the season so far even more special when you think that we have played the season without him.” \nLallana, who sat out the first half of the campaign after suffering a pre-season thigh strain, has started just one league match this season. \nThe 29-year-old featured for England at Wembley against Italy last week but faces a race to be fit for the World Cup in June. \nEngland boss Gareth Southgate has to name his final 23-man squad for the tournament in Russia by June 4.
