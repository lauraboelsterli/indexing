(Nasdaq: SYBX) , a clinical-stage company applying synthetic biology to probiotics to develop novel living medicines, today announced that it has agreed to sell 3,280,000 shares of its common stock to a large mutual fund investor in a registered direct offering. Synlogic anticipates aggregate gross proceeds from the offering will be approximately $30.0 million based on the offering price of $9.15 per share. The offering is expected to close on or about April 10, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.
