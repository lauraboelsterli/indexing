This compares with earnings of $157 million, or 21 cents per diluted share, on net sales of $1.7 billion for the same period last year.\nView our earnings release and financial statements in a printer-friendly PDF .\nExcluding net after-tax special charges of $6 million, the company reported net earnings of $275 million, or 36 cents per diluted share for the first quarter. This compares with net earnings before special items of $167 million for the same period last year and $234 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $544 million compared with $454 million for the first quarter of last year and $551 million for the fourth quarter of 2017.\n\"I am extremely pleased with our first quarter performance, as we fully capitalized on strong lumber, OSB and Western log markets to drive outstanding results, including the highest first quarter Wood Products EBITDA on record. This includes exceptional work by our teams to mitigate the effect of ongoing freight service disruptions,\" said Doyle R. Simons, president and chief executive officer. \"Looking forward, we are relentlessly focused on capturing the full benefit of improving housing starts and favorable market dynamics to drive value for shareholders.\"\nWEYERHAEUSER FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n2017\n2018\n2017\n(millions, except per share data)\nQ4\nQ1\nQ1\nNet sales\n$1,823\n$1,865\n$1,693\nNet earnings\n$271\n$269\n$157\nNet earnings per diluted share\n$0.36\n$0.35\n$0.21\nWeighted average shares outstanding, diluted\n758\n759\n755\nNet earnings before special items (1)\n$234\n$275\n$167\nNet earnings per diluted share before special items\n$0.31\n$0.36\n$0.22\nAdjusted EBITDA (2)\n$551\n$544\n$454\n(1) Fourth quarter 2017 after-tax special items include a $99 million gain on the sale of certain Southern timberlands, charges of $52 million for tax adjustments including enactment of tax legislation, charges of $31 million for product remediation, a benefit of $26 million for environmental remediation insurance recoveries, $12 million for Plum Creek merger-related costs, and a $7 million net benefit from an adjustment to accrued countervailing and antidumping duties on softwood lumber. First quarter 2018 after-tax special items include charges of $21 million for environmental remediation and a $15 million benefit from product remediation insurance proceeds. First quarter 2017 special items include after-tax charges of $10 million for Plum Creek merger-related costs.\n(2) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that management uses to evaluate the performance of the company. Adjusted EBITDA, as we define it, is operating income, adjusted for depreciation, depletion, amortization, basis of real estate sold, unallocated pension service costs and special items. Adjusted EBITDA excludes results from joint ventures. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation from and is not intended to represent an alternative to our GAAP results.

In the South, seasonally lower fee harvest volumes were offset by slightly higher average sales realizations, lower unit logging costs and reduced forestry expense.\n2Q 2018 Outlook - Weyerhaeuser expects second quarter earnings and Adjusted EBITDA will be significantly higher than the second quarter of 2017, but lower than the first quarter of 2018. Compared with the first quarter, the company anticipates seasonally higher unit logging costs and increased road and forestry costs, partially offset by slightly higher Western log sales realizations. Average Southern log sales realizations are expected to be similar to the first quarter.\nREAL ESTATE, ENERGY & NATURAL RESOURCES\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n2017\n2018\n(millions)\nQ4\nQ1\nChange\nNet sales\n$100\n$51\n($49)\nContribution to pre-tax earnings\n$50\n$25\n($25)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$87\n$41\n($46)\n1Q 2018 Performance - Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA decreased compared to the fourth quarter due to seasonally lower Real Estate sales.\n2Q 2018 Outlook - Weyerhaeuser anticipates second quarter earnings and Adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to the first quarter.
