    "text": "April 4, 2018 / 2:39 PM / Updated 5 minutes ago Hungary's Fidesz well ahead of rivals ahead of Sunday vote - polls Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nBUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbanâ€™s ruling Fidesz party remains well ahead of its main rivals based on the latest public opinion polls, conducted in late March, which also showed a modest decline in the number of undecided voters. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban delivers a speech at the National University of Public Service in Budapest, Hungary, April 4, 2018. REUTERS/Bernadett Szabo \nWith just four days left before Hungarians head to the polls, surveys conducted by think tanks Median and Republikon showed a slight increase in support for Fidesz as premier Orban campaigns for a third successive term in office. \nFidesz increased its backing by two points to 41 percent of all voters according to a survey by Median taken between March 23 and 27, the results of which were published on the website of Hungarian business weekly HVG. \nIt projected Fidesz would win 142 of the 199 seats in parliament, giving Orban a comfortable two-thirds majority. Nationalist Jobbik would have the second largest parliamentary group with 22 seats, followed by the Socialists at 19 seats. \nAnother survey, by the think-tank Republikon, showed Fidesz gaining one point among all voters for 30 percent support, followed by Jobbik and the Socialists at 12 and 11 percent, respectively.
