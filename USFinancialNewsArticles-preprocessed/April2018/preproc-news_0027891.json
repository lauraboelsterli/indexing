    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Advanced Proteome Therapeutics Corporation (“ APC ” or the “ Company ”) (TSX-V:APC) (FSE:0E8) announces that its Board of Directors has accepted the resignation of Mr. Randal Chase as President, Chief Executive Officer and a Director of the Corporation. At this time Mr. Chase has decided to pursue other opportunities and the Board wishes him well with his future endeavours.\nIn addition to Dr. Chase, independent directors Paul Kirkconnell and Thom Skinner have elected to step down from the Board of Directors effective immediately.\nDr. Allen Krantz, COO, of Advanced Proteome Therapeutics, commented that “Advanced Proteome Therapeutics will be announcing a new Board along with a CEO shortly.”\nABOUT THE COMPANY:\nAdvanced Proteome Therapeutics Corporation is developing a proprietary technology to directly target cancerous tumors and avoid destroying normal cells. This type of agent is capable of greater potency, higher specificity, and lower toxicity than other therapies that can also attack healthy cells. Advanced Proteome is working to streamline the process by which these agents are prepared, which to date, has been extremely cumbersome, limiting their potential. www.advancedproteome.com\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT:\nAdvanced Proteome Therapeutics Corporation\nAllen Krantz, Ph.D.\nChief Operating and Chief Scientific Officer\nTel: 617 638 0340\nhttp://www.advancedproteome.com\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nThis communication contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the Company’s business, which can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \"estimates\", \"believes\", \"expects\", \"may\", \"will”, \"should”, \"future\", \"potential\" or similar expressions or by a general discussion of the Company’s strategies, plans or intentions.
