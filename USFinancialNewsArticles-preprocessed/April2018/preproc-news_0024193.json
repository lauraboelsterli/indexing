    "text": "ABUJA, April 11 (Reuters) - Teleology Holdings has paid a $50 million deposit to buy 9mobile, Nigeriaâ€™s fourth largest telecoms provider, and has 90 days to pay $450 million to complete the acquisition, telecoms regulator said.\nTeleology was picked as preferred bidder for debt-laden 9mobile, the Nigerian Communications Commission said, following a bid process arranged by Barclays Africa.\n9mobile, formerly called Etisalat Nigeria, was taken over by its lenders last year for failing to keep up with its debt repayments.
