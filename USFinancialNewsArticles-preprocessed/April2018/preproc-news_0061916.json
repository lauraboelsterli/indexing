    "text": "LONDON, April 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global Ship Lease, Inc. (NYSE:GSL) (the “Company”), a containership charter owner, announced today its unaudited results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Highlights\n- Reported operating revenues of $36.1 million for the first quarter 2018\n- Reported net income for common shareholders for the first quarter 2018 of $4.2 million, the same as normalized net income\n- Generated $23.6 million of Adjusted EBITDA (1) for the first quarter 2018\n- On February 20, 2018, announced agreement to an extension of our charter with OOCL for the OOCL Qingdao , a 2004-built, 8,063 TEU containership. The extension commences in direct continuation of the current charter with effect from March 11, 2018, at a fixed rate of $14,000 per day. Earliest redelivery is now January 1, 2019, with latest redelivery March 15, 2019 (at charterer's option)\n- On March 1, 2018, announced agreement to acquire a 2005-built, 2,800 TEU containership for $11.3 million. Following delivery, which is expected to be during the second quarter of 2018, once the existing charter terminates, the vessel will commence charter employment with CMA CGM for a period of 12 months at a fixed rate of $9,000 per day.\nIan Webber, Chief Executive Officer of Global Ship Lease, stated, “In the first quarter, we continued to maximize the value of our contract coverage with top-tier counterparties by maintaining full employment across our fleet of mid-sized and smaller containerships. As we have successfully extended charters that support our strong cashflows, we are beginning to capture the benefits of a marked strengthening that is underway in the market for mid-sized and smaller vessels. We have also returned to growth with our recently agreed acquisition of a 2,800 TEU feeder vessel at an attractive price with a pre-arranged charter to CMA CGM, demonstrating both the value of our close relationship with an industry leader and our confidence in the long-term dynamics of the mid-sized and smaller vessel classes.\"\nMr. Webber continued, “The long-term market trends driving the appreciation in mid-sized and smaller containerships continue to be robust, with limited vessel ordering, a strong global economy, and idle capacity of the global fleet at a very low level of less than 1.5%. As we continue to pursue attractive growth opportunities, we remain confident that Global Ship Lease’s track record of high-quality operations, our strong contracted charter coverage, and our stable balance sheet put us in an excellent position to create lasting shareholder value in a strengthening market.”\nSELECTED FINANCIAL DATA – UNAUDITED\n(thousands of U.S. dollars)\nThree Three months ended months ended March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 Operating Revenues 36,102 39,642 Operating Income 15,491 18,434 Net Income for common shareholders 4,192 6,794 Adjusted EBITDA (1) 23,647 28,034 Normalized Net Income (1) 4,192 6,794 (1) Adjusted EBITDA and Normalized net income are non-US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP) measures, as explained further in this press release, and are considered by Global Ship Lease to be useful measures of its performance. Reconciliations of such non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable US GAAP measure are provided in this Earnings Release.\nOperating Revenues and Utilization\nThe fleet generated operating revenues from fixed-rate time charters of $36.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, down $3.5 million or 8.9% on operating revenues of $39.6 million for the comparative quarter in 2017. The reduction in revenue is mainly due to lower rates on the renewals of the charters of (i) the 2002-built Julie Delmas and the 2003-built Delmas Keta, effective September 2017, (ii) the 2005-built GSL Tianjin effective October 2017 and January 2018 and (iii) the 2004-built OOCL Qingdao effective March 2018, offset by 33 days less offhire, due mainly to fewer drydockings. There were 1,620 ownership days in the quarter, the same as in the comparative quarter. In the first quarter 2018, there were 17 days offhire, of which 13 were for a scheduled drydocking, giving an overall utilization of 99.0%. In the first quarter 2017, there were 50 days offhire, 47 of which were for three scheduled drydockings, giving an overall utilization of 96.9%.\nThe table below shows fleet utilization for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, and for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nThree months ended Year ended Mar 31, Mar 31, Dec 31, Dec 31, Dec 31, Dec 31, Dec 31, Days 2018 2017 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 Ownership days 1,620 1,620 6,570 6,588 6,893 6,270 6,205 Planned offhire - scheduled drydock (13) (47) (62) (100) (9) (48) (21) Unplanned offhire (4) (3) (40) (3) (7) (12) (7) Idle time 0 0 0 0 (13) (64) 0 Operating days 1,603 1,570 6,468 6,485 6,864 6,146 6,177 Utilization 99.0% 96.9% 98.4% 98.4% 99.6% 98.0% 99.5% There was one regulatory drydocking in the three months ended March 31, 2018; one further regulatory drydocking is planned for the year. There were four regulatory drydockings in 2017, three of which were in the first quarter.\nVessel Operating Expenses\nVessel operating expenses, which include costs of crew, lubricating oil, spares and insurance, were $10.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, up 1.1% from $10.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The average cost per ownership day for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $6,498, an increase of $72 per day, or 1.1%, from $6,426 in the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase is due to higher crew costs from a larger than normal number of crew changes offset by lower costs for insurance premiums and claim deductibles.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $8.2 million, compared to $9.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017, with the reduction due to the effect of lower book values for a number of vessels following impairment write downs in 2017.\nImpairment\nThe Company’s accounting policies require that tangible fixed assets such as vessels are reviewed individually for impairment in case of trigger events or changes in circumstances to assess whether their carrying amounts are recoverable.\nIn January 2018, the Company agreed with CMA CGM to extend the charter on GSL Tianjin by eight to 12 months (at the charterer’s option) at a fixed rate of $11,900 per day, commencing January 26, 2018. In February 2018, the Company agreed with OOCL to extend the charter of OOCL Qingdao to between January 1, 2019 and March 15, 2019 (at the charterer’s option) at a fixed rate of $14,000 per day, commencing March 11, 2018. These extensions triggered the performance of an impairment test on the two vessels. No impairment was identified.\nGeneral and Administrative Costs\nGeneral and administrative costs incurred were $1.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $1.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase is mainly due to higher staff costs and professional fees.\nOther Operating Income\nOther operating income in the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $6,000, compared to $42,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAs a result of the above, Adjusted EBITDA was $23.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, down from $28.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nInterest Expense\nDebt at March 31, 2018 totaled $414.8 million, comprising $360.0 million outstanding on our 9.875% notes due 2022 and $54.8 million under the new secured term loan, both of which were closed in October 2017 as part of a re-financing. The net proceeds, together with cash on hand, were used to refinance our previous 10.000% notes due 2019. In addition, all outstanding borrowings under both the previous revolving credit facility and the previous secured term loan were repaid and terminated.\nDebt at March 31, 2017 totaled $426.4 million, comprising $365.8 million outstanding on our previous 10.000% Notes, $39.2 million on the revolving credit facility and $21.4 million on the secured term loan.\nInterest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was $10.8 million, down $0.2 million on the interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017 of $11.0 million, mainly due to a slightly lower amount of bond outstanding and a slightly lower interest rate.\nInterest income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $0.3 million and was $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nTaxation\nTaxation for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was not material.\nEarnings Allocated to Preferred Shares\nThe Series B preferred shares, issued on August 20, 2014, carry a coupon of 8.75%, the cost of which for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $0.8 million, the same as in the comparative quarter.\nNet Income Available to Common Shareholders and Normalized Net Income\nNet income available to common shareholders for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $4.2 million. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, net income was $6.8 million. This year-over-year decrease is mainly due to lower revenue following charter renewals, offset by lower depreciation.\nNormalized net income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was the same as that reported.\nFleet\nThe following table provides information about the on-the-water fleet of 18 vessels as at March 31, 2018. 16 vessels are chartered to CMA CGM, and two to OOCL.\nRemaining Earliest Daily Charter Charter Charter Vessel Capacity Year Purchase Term (2) Expiry Rate Name in TEUs (1) Built by GSL (years) Date $ CMA CGM Matisse 2,262 1999 Dec 2007 1.7 Sept 21, 2019 15,300 CMA CGM Utrillo 2,262 1999 Dec 2007 1.7 Sept 11, 2019 15,300 Delmas Keta 2,207 2003 Dec 2007 0.5 Aug 6, 2018 7,800 Julie Delmas 2,207 2002 Dec 2007 0.4 Jul 28, 2018 7,800 Kumasi 2,207 2002 Dec 2007 0.8 – 2.8 (3) Nov 16, 2018 9,800 Marie Delmas 2,207 2002 Dec 2007 0.8 - 2.8 (3) Nov 16, 2018 9,800 CMA CGM La Tour 2,272 2001 Dec 2007 1.7 Sept 20, 2019 15,300 CMA CGM Manet 2,272 2001 Dec 2007 1.7 Sept 7, 2019 15,300 CMA CGM Alcazar 5,089 2007 Jan 2008 2.8 Oct 18, 2020 33,750 CMA CGM Château d’If 5,089 2007 Jan 2008 2.8 Oct 11, 2020 33,750 CMA CGM Thalassa 11,040 2008 Dec 2008 7.8 Oct 1, 2025 47,200 CMA CGM Jamaica 4,298 2006 Dec 2008 4.7 Sept 17, 2022 25,350 CMA CGM Sambhar 4,045 2006 Dec 2008 4.7 Sept 16, 2022 25,350 CMA CGM America 4,045 2006 Dec 2008 4.7 Sept 19, 2022 25,350 CMA CGM Berlioz 6,621 2001 Aug 2009 3.4 May 28, 2021 34,000 GSL Tianjin (4) 8,063 2005 Oct 2014 0.7 Sept 26, 2018 11,900 OOCL Qingdao (5) 8,063 2004 Mar 2015 0.9 Jan 1, 2019 14,000 OOCL Ningbo 8,063 2004 Sep 2015 0.6 Sep 17, 2018 34,500 (1) Twenty-foot Equivalent Units.

The first of these options was exercised in July 2017, extending the charters to end 2018. The two remaining options allow us to extend the charters to December 31, 2020 plus or minus 90 days at charterer’s option. The earliest possible re-delivery date, not taking into account our remaining options, is shown in the table. (4) The time charter for GSL Tianjin with CMA CGM which commenced October 25, 2017,was extended with effect from January 26, 2018 at a fixed rate of $11,900 per day for a period of eight to 12 months, at charterer’s option. (5) In February 2018 we agreed to an extension of our charter with OOCL for the OOCL Qingdao. The extension commenced in direct continuation of the current charter with effect from March 11, 2018, at a fixed rate of $14,000 per day.

ADJUSTED EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest income and expense including amortization of deferred finance costs, earnings allocated to preferred shares, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairment. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-US GAAP quantitative measure used to assist in the assessment of the Company's ability to generate cash from its operations. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. Adjusted EBITDA is not defined in US GAAP and should not be considered to be an alternate to Net income or any other financial metric required by such accounting principles. Our use of Adjusted EBITDA may vary from the use of similarly titled measures by others in our industry.\nADJUSTED EBITDA - UNAUDITED\n(thousands of U.S. dollars) Three Three months months ended ended Mar 31, Mar 31, 2018 2017 Net income available to common shareholders 4,192 6,794 Adjust: Depreciation 8,156 9,600 Interest income (269 ) (93 ) Interest expense 10,787 10,957 Income tax 15 10 Earnings allocated to preferred shares 766 766 Adjusted EBITDA 23,647 28,034 B. Normalized net income\nNormalized net income represents net income adjusted for the premium paid on the tender offer for the Notes and the gain made on open market purchases of the Notes, together with the related accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount, and for impairment charges. Normalized net income is a non-GAAP quantitative measure which we believe will assist investors and analysts who often adjust reported net income for non-operating items that do not affect operating performance or operating cash generated. Normalized net income is not defined in US GAAP and should not be considered to be an alternate to net income or any other financial metric required by such accounting principles. Our use of Normalized net income may vary from the use of similarly titled measures by others in our industry.\nThere are no differences between Reported Net Income and Normalized Net Income for the quarters ended March 31, 2017 and 2018.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis communication contains forward-looking statements.
