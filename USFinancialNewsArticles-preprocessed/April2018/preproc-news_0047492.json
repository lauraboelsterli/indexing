REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo “We are a long way from conclusion on North Korea, maybe things will work out, and maybe they won’t - only time will tell....But the work I am doing now should have been done a long time ago!” he said on Twitter.\nReporting by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ",
