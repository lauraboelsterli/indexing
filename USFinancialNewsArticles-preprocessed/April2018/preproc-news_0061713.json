    "text": "April 30, 2018 / 9:38 AM / Updated 7 hours ago Barnier says rapid EU-UK progress needed on Irish border Padraic Halpin 3 Min Read\nDUNDALK, Ireland (Reuters) - The EU’s Brexit negotiator expressed confidence on Monday that a solution for the Irish border can be achieved if rapid progress is made by June, but said a real risk remained of Britain leaving the bloc without an overall deal.

REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne\nNorthern Ireland will be Britain’s only land frontier with the European Union after Brexit. Both sides say they are committed to keeping the border with the Irish Republic open, but finding a practical solution has proved elusive so far.\nThe EU and Dublin insist the Brexit treaty must lock in a backstop arrangement in case a future trade pact does not remove the need for border controls. London signed up for this last month but disagrees with the EU’s means of achieving it. Related Coverage EU's Barnier says confident of deal to avoid hard Irish border\n“We need to ... agree rapidly by June on the scope of all island customs and regulations - the safety and controls that we need to respect the single market,” negotiator Michel Barnier said, referring to an EU leaders’ meeting in June that he called a “stepping stone” towards reaching a full agreement in October.

REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne\n“I am confident that together with unity of the EU27 and a constructive attitude on both sides, we will be able to agree the right solution,” he told a news conference in the Irish border town of Dundalk. However, he added: “There is a real risk and we have to be prepared for any options, including no deal.”\nUnder the EU proposal, if all other attempts to avoid a hard border fail, Northern Ireland would form a “common regulatory area” with Ireland and 26 other EU states, in effect keeping the British province in a customs union with the EU.\nBritain, which is still debating its own Brexit strategy, says an EU-UK free-trade deal to be sealed by 2021 can solve the border issue, and Prime Minister Theresa May has rejected the EU proposal as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK.
