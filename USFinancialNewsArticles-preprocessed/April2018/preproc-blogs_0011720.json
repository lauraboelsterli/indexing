In fact, in industries like tech and healthcare, workers can be incredibly loyal.\nJob site Indeed analyzed millions of resumes posted by U.S. job seekers to find who was most likely and least likely to job hop. For their analysis, Indeed looked at career-switch search rates of the top 300 job titles held by individuals with at least a bachelor's degree.\nHero Images | Getty Images They found that workers with these 20 job titles were the least likely to even think about leaving their jobs:\n15.

Nurse practitioners, registered nurses and practical nurses were among some of the most loyal job titles. One reason so many nurses are dedicated to the profession? They've already invested significant amounts of time and money in becoming a nurse.\nOverall, jobs in the tech and healthcare industries experience lower turnover, in part because of high growth and wages. Registered nursing jobs are expected to grow 15 percent between 2016 and 2026, guaranteeing current nurses professional stability. Furthermore, research from the Federal Reserve of St. Louis suggests that industries with higher wages experience higher worker retention rates.\nLike this story?
