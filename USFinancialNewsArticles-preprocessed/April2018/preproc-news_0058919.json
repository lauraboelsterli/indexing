    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cryptobloc Technologies Corp. (“ Cryptobloc ” or the “ Company ”) (CSE:CRYP) (OTC:CRYBF) (Frankfurt Stock Exchange:GR9), at the request of IIROC, Cryptobloc Technologies would like to further clarify the details of the Letter of Intent with Milson, the agreement includes a base average price of $1400 USD for the Cryptomining units; however, there will be discounts and incentives for bulk purchasing. The agreement will be completed in multiple tranches beginning with an initial order of no less than 400 Avalon 821 and/or Avalon 841 machines purchased with an allocation of company shares to be completed in the next 4 weeks. Following the successful delivery and setup of the first order, future orders will be completed with a mix of cash and/or shares. The exact mix will be determined as future financing options are explored. The agreement envisions an estimated 8 to 12 orders to be completed over the next 12 months.\nAs per the Letter of Intent - the terms for the first order are still being finalized; however, both parties agree that an allotment of shares equaling the principle value of the equipment plus 20% will be used to secure the machines. Repayment terms for the principal and interest will be dependent on the value of Bitcoin, and thus the efficacy of the machines, over a 12-month period.\nAbout Cryptobloc Technologies Corp.\nBased in Vancouver, BC - Cryptobloc Technologies Corp. is focused on developing and implementing Blockchain, Distributed Ledger, Closed Loop, and Cryptocurrency services for Government and commercial partners.
