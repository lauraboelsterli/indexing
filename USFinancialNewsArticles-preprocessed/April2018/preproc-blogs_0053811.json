Photo: Reuters\nDenmark’s Ørsted A/S already has the financing it would need if its bids in two energy auctions succeed, the company’s finance chief said.\n“We have made ourselves ready,” Chief Financial Officer Marianne Wiinholt said on Thursday in an interview with CFO Journal. “We have cash on the balance sheet and funded all other financial needs.”\nThe state-owned company, formerly known as Dong Energy A/S, is waiting for the outcome of a number of auctions, including a wind farm off the coast of Massachusetts and a project to beef up Taiwan’s power grid. The winner of the Taiwan project is to be named no later than April 30, according to Ms. Wiinholt. A decision on the Massachusetts site will be handed down on May 23, Ms. Wiinholt said.\nThe U.S. and Taiwan are considered to be among the most important offshore wind markets outside of Europe, said Sam Arie, an analyst at UBS Group AG.\nØrsted’s moves come as part of a wider transformation toward becoming a renewable-energy company. The Fredericia, Denmark-based company last year renamed itself and sold its remaining oil-and-gas assets. It commands around 40% of the global offshore wind market, according to Mr. Arie.\n“Ørsted is already seen as the leading supplier of offshore wind energy in Europe,” said Gurpreet Gujral, an analyst at Macquarie Capital Ltd. “That’s certainly a competitive advantage for their outstanding bids.”\nThe company in November sold a green bond — debt earmarked for environmentally friendly projects — totaling €750 million ($908.58 million), and a €500 million green hybrid security, mainly to European investors, according to Ms. Wiinholt. It had 3.75 billion Danish kroner ($609.86 million) in cash on its balance sheet at the end of the first quarter. “This is a lot of money and should cover us,” she said.\nØrsted plans to sell a bond denominated in Taiwanese dollars should it win the project, which involves building as much as 1.2 gigawatts of grid capacity. Revenue from the project will be in Taiwanese dollars.\nThe company hasn’t marketed the issue yet because local regulations only allow for it to do so once it has won the tender. Ørsted is in talks with Taiwanese and international banks, Ms. Wiinholt said.\nØrsted is also preparing to sell 50% of its stake in the Hornsea Project One, a wind farm to be completed by 2020 off the English east coast. Reducing its holding, a tactic known in the industry as a “farm down”, is supposed to generate free cash that could be used for new projects in the U.S. or Taiwan, said Mr. Gujral.\n“The new capital release from the next farm down from Hornsea should further enhance their capacity to invest,” he said.\nØrsted is in discussions with one remaining potential buyer and expects to reach a sale agreement by the end of 2018 or early 2019, said Ms. Wiinholt.\nThe company on Thursday reported a profit of 3.04 billion kroner for the first quarter, on revenue of 19.80 billion kroner. In the first quarter of 2017, it earned 2.64 billion kroner. Revenue was 16.49 billion kroner.\nShare this: CAPITAL CAPITAL INVESTMENT Previous The Morning Ledger: Beijing Ready to Respond if U.S. Curbs Chinese Investments Next Insurance Industry Could Take Hit on BEAT Provision ",
