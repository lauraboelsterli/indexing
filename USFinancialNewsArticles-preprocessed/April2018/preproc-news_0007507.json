    "text": "SASKATOON, Saskatchewan--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Point Athabasca FHQ has announced that it is now operating under a new company name, Great Plains Contracting.\n“With our transition to Great Plains Contracting, our goal is to further our own distinct identity and promote clearer communications with our clients,” says Colin Smith-Windsor, the company’s Manager.\nHeadquartered in Saskatoon, Great Plains Contracting provides quality general construction services to clients while creating meaningful opportunities for Indigenous workers. The company successfully delivers a wide range of construction services to K+S Potash Canada, SaskPower, Nutrien, Mosaic and other provincial businesses.\nThe Company continues to use a bison logo to accompany its new name. “Our new name and logo reflect the Great Plains where our Indigenous heritage and our Saskatchewan base are rooted. They also speak to our company’s bright, open future as we look to grow our business across Western Canada and the northern U.S.,” Smith-Windsor says.\nAbout Great Plains Contracting\nGreat Plains Contracting is an Indigenous partnership in southern Saskatchewan comprised of File Hills Qu’Appelle Tribal Council Developments LP (50%), Points Athabasca Contracting Ltd. (17%) and Graham Construction (33%). This partnership was formed in 2011 to further engage the Indigenous community in Saskatchewan’s growing economy, and contribute to the continuing development of Saskatchewan, particularly the mining sector. Bringing together significant experience through its shareholder structure, the company provides a wide range of general construction contracting services to support commercial, industrial and mining projects.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180404005008/en/\nGreat Plains Contracting\nColin Smith-Windsor, (306) 242-4929\nManager\ncolins@greatplainscontracting.ca\nSource: Great Plains Contracting",
