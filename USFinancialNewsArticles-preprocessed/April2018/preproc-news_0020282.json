FILE PHOTO: A man attaches a placard to the fence of the Greek Embassy as civil society activists call on the Greek government to grant political asylum to Maria Efimova, a Pilatus Bank employee who ignited a political scandal in Malta when she became a source for investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia who was murdered last year, in Ta' Xbiex, Malta March 27, 2018. REUTERS/Darrin Zammit Lupi \nMaria Efimova, a Russian who left Malta for Greece last year with her family, surrendered to Greek police last month and was arrested at Maltaâ€™s request. \nMaltese prosecutors had filed a European warrant for her on suspicion of embezzlement and said she should be tried on the island. \nEfimova denied the accusation. The court ordered her release on Thursday. \nEfimova was employed for three months in 2016 by the Maltese-registered Pilatus Bank [RIC:RIC:PILAT.UL]. The journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia, named her as the source of internal bank documents which Galizia said indicated that Michelle Muscat, wife of Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, owned a secret company in Panama. \nJoseph Muscat and his wife have denied the accusations. \nA group of 36 European parliament members signed a letter this month calling for Efimova not to be extradited to Malta. \nCaruana Galizia was killed by a car bomb in October 2017. Three men have been charged with killing her but police have yet to give motive. \nPilatus Bank has accused Efimova of embezzlement. Efimova denies all charges and has counter-sued the bank for failing to pay her salary. Reporting by Constantinos Georgizas; Editing by Andrew Heavens",
