Earlier this month, Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola travelled to Washington for talks with senior U.S. Treasury officials, her agenda showed.\nAhead of the vote, Reizniece-Ozola called for patience from critics. Transparency International said Latvia still needed to beef up its authority to fight money laundering, for example.\n“The criticism is not directed to the policy ... but to enforcement,” she said. “It can’t be changed overnight.”\nThe law passed on Thursday bans banks from dealing with shell companies unless they can prove they are legitimate firms.\nThe vote was 57 in favour and 17 against, all members of the pro-Russian opposition Harmony party.\nLatvia’s financial watchdog said it hoped the law would cut the number of the roughly 17,000 opaque shell firms with links to Latvia by at least two-thirds within a couple of months.\nLouise Shelley, a professor and expert in money laundering at George Mason University in Virginia, said Latvia would need to do more, however.\n“Until the U.S. government sees a significant change in the flows of Russian money through Latvia, it is unlikely they will relieve the pressure,” she said. “This requires ... greater law enforcement action.”\nGATEWAY Since securing independence from Russia in 1991, more than a dozen Latvian banks have promoted themselves as a gateway to Western markets for clients in Russia and former Soviet states such as Ukraine - and promised Swiss-style secrecy for clients.\nSince the country joined the European Union in 2004, transfers were deemed less risky for Western banks to handle than if they had come directly from Russia, bankers and officials have said.\nIn many cases, money was lodged in a Latvian bank and then funnelled to accounts elsewhere, such as Switzerland, they said.\nMany lenders taking foreign deposits dealt with shell companies, roughly half of which are registered in Britain and the British Virgin Islands, making it hard to identify the ultimate beneficiary.\nThe new law will upset what experts see as a central pillar of a financial system that allowed money to arrive from Russia or elsewhere and be taken out as dollars or euros.\nMore than 200 million euros was taken out of Latvia last year in cash, bringing the total value of banknotes leaving to more than 750 million euros since the start of 2015, according to customs data seen by Reuters. ( tmsnrt.rs/2FFXn3W )\nThe case has now attracted the attention of the European Parliament, as well as officials in the European Commission, the bodies responsible for writing new European laws.\nLawmakers at a European Parliament hearing on Thursday examined the situation in Latvia and similar problems in Malta.\nEarlier this year, the chairman of Malta’s Pilatus Bank was arrested on charges of breaking U.S. sanctions, prompting criticism of the Maltese authorities for inaction.\nPeters Putnins, who heads Latvia’s banking watchdog, spoke at the hearing and acknowledged the need for change.\n“The global political situation has changed,” he said, adding that the proportion of foreign deposits in Latvian banks would further decline from roughly 30 percent of the total now.\nForeign minister Edgars Rinkevics said further reforms were in train.\n“We are all interested in cleaning up things,” he told Reuters. Latvia wants to be “the country that managed to clean up the sector and to get out of this situation stronger than before”.\nNot everyone is in agreement, however. The Russian-speaking opposition, who come from a 500,000-strong minority in the country, are sceptical about the need for radical change.\nIgors Pimenovs, a Harmony party lawmaker, said the government should be careful not to drive away foreign clients and allow “political retaliation between the East and the West”.\n“Latvia is really a bridge” between Russia and the West, said Pimenovs. “Not only a geographical one but also an economical one.”\nWriting By John O'Donnell Editing by Sonya Hepinstall\n ",
