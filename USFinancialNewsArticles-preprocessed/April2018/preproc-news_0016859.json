    "text": "WASHINGTON, April 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee plans to hold a future hearing on Cambridge Analytica and other companies that may have improperly obtained Facebook Inc user data, the chairman of the panel said on Tuesday.\n\"There are plenty of questions about the behavior of Cambridge Analytica, and we expect to hold a future hearing on Cambridge and similar firms,\" Senator John Thune said in a written statement ahead of Tuesday's hearing with Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg faces questions before a joint meeting of the Senate Commerce and Judiciary committees after the company acknowledged that the personal information of up to 87 million people was harvested from Facebook by Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that has counted U.S. President Donald Trumps election campaign among its clients.
