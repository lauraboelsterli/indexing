    "text": "One person was killed after a Southwes t flight en route from New York to Dallas made an emergency landing at Philadelphia International Airport, a National Transportation Safety Board official said on Tuesday.\nNTSB Chaiman Robert Sumwalt said at a press conference that a team was on its way to begin its investigation of the incident. Southwest Flight 1380 made an emergency landing after its crew reported damage to one of the engines as well as the fuselage, or main body of the plane, and at least one window.\nEarlier, Philadelphia officials had said one passenger was taken to the hospital and seven others were treated for minor injuries but not transported. \nThe aircraft, a Boeing 737-700, had 143 passengers and five crew members on board, according to Southwest. \nSouthwest flight twitter \n\nThe plane's engine blew shortly after takeoff, according local news outlet NBC 10 . Facebook user Marty Martinez said an explosion \"blew open window\" several seats away from him. Martinez posted a video of passengers with oxygen masks over their mouths and photos of the blown-out window.\n\nNBC 10 Tweet \nJoe Marcus Tweet \n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration issued a ground stop for planes at other airports waiting to depart for Philadelphia International. \n\nPhiladelphia International Tweet \n\nThe FAA said it is investigating the incident. The NTSB will take charge of the probe. Boeing also said it is looking into the incident and will provide technical assistance. The 737 was powered by two CFM-56 engines, according to flight-tracking service FlightRadar24. CFM is a joint venture between General Electric and France's Safran Aircraft Engines.\nEngines are designed with a covering so that if an engine experiences an explosion or ingests a foreign object, blades do not fly off and damage the fuselage. Such incidents that damage the fuselage are extremely rare, said Richard Aboulafia, vice president at aviation analysis firm Teal Group. The engine is among the most commonly used around the world, he added.\n\"This is as close as you get to the textbook definition of a workhorse engine,\" said Aboulafia. \"There are still incidents that can only be described as freak.\"",
