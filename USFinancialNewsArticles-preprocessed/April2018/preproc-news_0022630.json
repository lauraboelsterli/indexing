    "text": "Cramer assesses the damage in Facebook, Tesla and Amazon's stocks after scandals April 10, 2018 \nSince Axios published a story titled “Trump Hates Amazon, Not Facebook,” Amazon has been the target of a firestorm launched from President Trump’s Twitter account. \nTrump has railed against the e-commerce giant for its tax treatment and what he considers to be an unfair deal with the U.S. Post Office, but most market-watchers assume his frustration stems from his hatred of the Washington Post, which is owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos . \nShares of Amazon are down 11 percent from its early 2018 highs and down roughly 4 percent from when the retail colossus came under fire from Trump. \n“Even though the company’s facing intense criticism from the leader of the free world, I think the stock’s a buy, plain and simple,” Cramer argued. “At the end of the day, it’s hard to see how this will impact Amazon’s earnings.” \nThe “Mad Money” host reminded viewers that Amazon started collecting state and local sales taxes years ago, and that if the Post Office pushed back on their deal, Amazon could simply take its business to FedEx or UPS .
