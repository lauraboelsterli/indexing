    "text": "FRANKFURT, Deutsche Bank has appointed Frank Kuhnke as new chief operating officer, the German lender said on Tuesday, amid a continuing reshuffle of its executive suite.\nKuhnke replaces Kim Hammonds, who stepped down last week, having come under pressure after critical comments she made about the bank became public.\nUnlike Hammonds, Kuhnke will not be a member of the management board, but he will regularly attend its meetings, Deutsche Bank said.
