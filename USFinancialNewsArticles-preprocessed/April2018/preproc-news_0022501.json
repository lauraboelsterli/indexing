    "text": " 22 AM / in 10 minutes Germany wants to avoid restrictions or bans for diesel cars - Merkel   \nBERLIN, April 11 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday that the federal government wanted to avoid driving restrictions or even bans for highly polluting diesel cars. \nSpeaking to reporters after a two-day cabinet meeting, Merkel said: “There are no plans for a big car summit, but there surely will be meetings of the technical working groups which have been created in the framework of this summit process.” \nMerkel added that the transport minister and the environment minister had agreed that any driving restrictions in the form of “blue badges” or city bans for diesel cars should be avoided.
