    "text": "7 COMMENTS LONDON—British legislators on Thursday delivered a symbolic defeat to Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan for leaving the European Union, a piece of parliamentary theater that nevertheless foreshadows some tougher battles ahead to persuade skeptical lawmakers to support her vision for Brexit .\nLawmakers backed a bipartisan motion calling on the government to establish a customs union with the EU as part of a long-term economic settlement with the bloc . It followed a debate by a small number of rank-and-file legislators outside the normal legislative business of parliament and isn’t binding on the government. No formal vote was held; officials declared the motion carried after lawmakers vocally signaled their assent.\nBut parliament will vote for real on future customs arrangements next month, potentially scrambling her Brexit strategy. Mrs. May lost her majority in an election last year and remains in power thanks to the backing of a handful of lawmakers from Northern Ireland.\nOn Thursday, a dozen members of her ruling Conservatives spoke in favor of the customs union motion—enough to inflict defeat on the government were they to back it again.\nConservative lawmaker Nicky Morgan backed the motion in support of a new customs union with the EU. Photo: Luke MacGregor/Bloomberg News “This country is being asked to experiment at other people’s pleasure with a free-trade policy where we do not know what the costs will be for constituents and businesses in this country,” said Conservative lawmaker Nicky Morgan.\nDefeat next month would likely mean Mrs. May would need to ditch her opposition to a new customs union, said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group, a consultancy.\nSuch a switch could destabilize her government, which includes hard-line Brexit supporters such as international trade secretary Liam Fox and Boris Johnson, foreign secretary, and spark rebellion among pro-Brexit Conservative lawmakers that could result in a challenge to Mrs. May’s leadership.\nA customs union with the EU would mean the U.K. accepting the bloc’s common tariffs on goods imported from nonmember countries, effectively mirroring the existing EU customs union of which the U.K. is a member.\nNewsletter Sign-up Proponents say this would ensure post-Brexit trade with the EU remains tariff-free and extra bureaucratic burdens on business are kept to a minimum. They also say it would ease, though not eliminate, the need to reimpose a physical border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland , a key goal in negotiations.\nBut opponents argue it would deprive London of potentially the biggest prize from exiting the EU: the ability to strike its own free-trade deals with countries such as the U.S. The U.K. would also probably have to swallow future EU trade deals in which it played no part in negotiating.\nThe government on Thursday reiterated that exiting the customs union and not entering a new one remains a central plank of its Brexit plan.\n“Forming a new customs union with the EU is not compatible with a meaningful independent trade policy,” Mel Stride, a treasury minister, said at the close of Thursday’s debate.\nWrite to Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.com",
