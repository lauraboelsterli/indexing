The completion of the merger is still subject to obtaining antitrust clearances from MOFCOM, the Japan Fair Trade Commission, Taiwan Fair Trade Commission, Philippine Competition Commission, German Federal Cartel Office and Federal Competition Authority in Austria, each of which continues to review the transaction.
