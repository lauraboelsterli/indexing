    "text": "Sacramento, CA , April 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A new report and video has been published on Innovest Global, Inc. (OTC PINK: IVST). Innovest Global, Inc. is a diversified holding company that focuses on acquiring niche, high-growth businesses that are capable of generating significant annual revenue. The company’s planned subsidiaries operate across telehealth, biotech, commercial energy, business-to-business distribution, national call center and auto sales.\nThe report provides an overview of Innovest Global, Inc., its subsidiaries, financials, industry analysis and more. The content also covers the global outlook for the healthcare sector.\nDeloitte: 656 Million People Or 11.5% Of Global Population Is Aged 65 Or Older\nTechnological advancements have aided humanity across all aspects of our lives. One of the key benefits of greater technological capabilities is ability to develop more effective healthcare treatments. After all, health and wellness are key components to any thriving civilization. Greater abilities to extend human life can be witnessed through the statistic that 656 million people, or around 11.50% of total world population, is now aged 65 years or older.\nAccording to Deloitte’s 2018 Global Life Sciences Outlook report, global healthcare spending is forecast to reach $8.7 trillion by 2020, compared to $7 trillion in 2015. The market research firm credits the spending increase on aging and expanding populations, growing emerging markets, advancements in medical technology, and rising labor costs.\nHowever, the rising capabilities of medical technology are not expected to stop the growth of ailments and deadly diseases. For example, Deloitte estimates that diabetes will affect around 642 million people by 2040 thanks to rapid urbanization, diet changes, increasingly sedentary lifestyles, and skyrocketing obesity rates.\nOn a more positive note, medical technology (Medtech) is seen as another strong area of the healthcare sector, which is forecast to reach $521.9 billion by 2022. Overall, researchers see in virtro diagnostics as the key driver and largest segment of medtech moving forward.\nAccording to the American Brain Tumor Association , an estimated 80,000 new cases of primary brain tumors will be diagnosed this year. Another 17,000 people are estimated to lose their battle with a primary brain or CNS tumor this year.\nAccording to GBI Research , global revenues for the cancer vaccine market are forecast to grow from $2.5 billion in 2015 to $7.5 billion in 2022, which represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.93%.\nInnovest Recently Signs LOI to Acquire 20% Stake in StemVax Therapeutics, A Brain Cancer Vaccine Developer\nInnovest Global recently announced that it has signed a Letter of Intent to acquire a 20% stake in StemVax Therapeutics, a biotechnology company that is currently developing a brain cancer vaccine.\nThe StemVax Glioblast (SVX-GB) cancer vaccine is being designed and formulated to help restore a patient’s immune system in order to fight off existing cancer cells within the body.\nThe vaccine is designed to fight against glioblastoma brain cancers, which is the same type of tumor that is currently affecting Arizona Senator John McCain.\nIn other news, Innovest also recently announced that its Innovest Energy Group has completed the previously-announced LOI acquisition of H.P. Technologies , an energy procurement company that is generating annual revenues of $1.2 million. Furthermore, H.P.’s owner, Dennis Giancola, has joined the Innovest Energy Group division.\nEntering into the second quarter, Innovest Global is now generating baseline quarterly revenues of around $800,000, just from its Commercial & Industrial Energy division alone. This comes as management is scheduled to officially launch its Biotech & Health Sciences division this Spring.\nManagement announced in its March shareholder update that it has engaged NMS, Inc. to conduct a two-year audit on the company’s financials. The PCAOB-compliant firm has a strong 30-year track record of success and has a staff of 40 employees. This effectively begins the company’s plan to uplist to higher exchanges, such as the OTCQX and eventually the NASDAQ or NYSE.\nInnovest Global, Inc. was also recently featured on the inaugural episode of Spotlight Growth Live , a video web series that focuses on emerging growth companies.\nFor more information on Innovest Global, Inc.,\nplease visit http://innovestglobal.com and http://spotlightgrowth.com/index.php/2018/04/09/healthcare-sector-sees-rosy-outlook-as-global-health...\nSpotlightGrowth.com is a digital hub for micro-caps, small-caps, crowdfunding, cryptocurrency, and other emerging growth investors.
