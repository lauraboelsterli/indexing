(the \"Company\") (NASDAQ/NGS: RCII) today announced positive same store sales growth in the Core U.S. business for the first quarter of 2018 and increases annual free cash flow guidance for 2018.\nOperational Improvement\nPreliminary same store sales growth in the Core U.S. segment for the first quarter of 2018 increased 0.3 percent over the same period a year ago, with March 2018 increasing at 1.6 percent. The continued sequential improvement within the first quarter was primarily driven by better collections due to lower promotional activity and a higher portfolio balance versus last year driven largely by an increase in the average ticket per customer. Acceptance Now same store sales grew 3.3 percent in the first quarter compared to first quarter 2017.\n“Our value proposition changes being implemented in the Core U.S. business are already starting to make an impact, even in their early stages. Specifically, the targeted pricing approach with less promotional dollars being used in the Core is already providing better revenue results,” stated Mitch Fadel, Chief Executive Officer of Rent-A-Center. “Within Acceptance Now, we rolled out a new value proposition in the quarter and are already experiencing a higher ticket while maintaining lower delinquency rates. We are continuing to make refinements to the program and are experiencing recent increases in demand, as well.”\nIn addition, the cost savings and working capital initiatives instituted by the Company earlier this year are exceeding management’s expectations. Since the end of 2017, the Company has reduced debt by over $75 million due to the stronger topline and improved performance, primarily due to the initiatives. The Company currently has approximately $175 million in revolving credit availability, taking into account the $50 million reserve necessary given the Company’s current fixed charge coverage ratio. The Company has $20 million currently drawn on its revolving credit facility.\nBased on the improved portfolio performance, and the cost savings and working capital initiatives exceeding management’s plan in the first quarter, the Company is raising its full year free cash flow guidance from at least $130 million to at least $170 million.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Earnings Release and Conference Call Details\nThe Company expects to release its full first quarter 2018 financial results on Monday, April 30, 2018, after the market closes. At 8:30am ET on Tuesday, May 1, 2018, the Company will host a conference call to discuss the results. A live audio of the conference call will be available on the company’s investor relations website at http://investor.rentacenter.com .\nStrategic & Financial Alternatives Update\nThe Company’s board of directors and its advisors are actively engaged with bidders interested in acquiring the Company and expect to reach a determination during the second quarter of 2018. The Company does not intend to make any additional comments regarding these discussions or any potential transaction unless and until a formal agreement has been reached or the Company’s board of directors has approved a definitive course of action with respect to its ongoing financial and strategic alternatives review.\nAbout Rent-A-Center, Inc.\nA rent-to-own industry leader, Plano, Texas-based, Rent-A-Center, Inc., is focused on improving the quality of life for its customers by providing them the opportunity to obtain ownership of high-quality, durable products such as consumer electronics, appliances, computers, furniture and accessories, under flexible rental purchase agreements with no long-term obligation.
