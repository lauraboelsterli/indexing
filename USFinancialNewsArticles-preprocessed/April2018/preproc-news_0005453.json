    "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Montecito Medical Real Estate, a premier owner of medical office buildings throughout the U.S., has acquired WVP-The Doctors’ Clinic medical office building in Salem, Oregon.\nWVP-The Doctors’ Clinic, which is part of WVP Medical Group, is one of the largest multi-specialty providers in the greater Salem area.\nThe two-story, 34,554 square-foot property in Salem, approximately 50 miles south of Portland, is the largest facility for WVP Medical Group, which operates six clinics throughout the Salem market. The building was built between 1996 and 1999 and is 100% occupied by WVP-The Doctors’ Clinic. The property is directly across the street from a large Kaiser Permanente outpatient facility and is strategically located on the corner of heavily trafficked Skyline Rd. and Kuebler Blvd.\n\"The physician owners of Doctors' Clinic Building Company carefully considered multiple offers and were deeply satisfied with Montecito as a purchaser both in terms of the comprehensive offer and because of Montecito's mission as an owner of medical real estate,” said Steven Nord, Administrator of The Doctors' Clinic Building Company.\n“Montecito was impressed with not only the robust medical market dynamics in the Salem area, but also the practice itself, which is one of the strongest multi-specialty groups in the State of Oregon,” said Chip Conk, CEO of Montecito Medical . “We are very excited to add this premier property to our growing portfolio of medical real estate.”\nThe Doctors’ Clinic was founded in 1903 and has been providing personal medical care to the residents of Salem and the surrounding communities for more than a century.

The building also contains a CT scanner and a fully digital radiology department.\nThe Clinic currently has 90 employees including 20 medical providers, 14 physicians, three physician assistants, and three nurse practitioners.
