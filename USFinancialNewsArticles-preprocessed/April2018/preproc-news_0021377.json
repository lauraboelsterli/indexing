    "text": "0 COMMENTS Good morning. Mark Zuckerberg’s trip to Washington isn’t over yet as he appears today before the House Energy and Commerce Committee to focus on Facebook’s use and protection of user data. But first, let’s get straight into the spectacle of his grilling in front of the Senate Commerce Committee and Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday.\nHe’s Nervous But on the Surface He Looks Calm and Ready Mr. Zuckerberg calmly answered questions and absorbed criticisms from lawmakers for around five hours without breaking into a sweat. In terms of a highlights reel for marketers catching up this morning, these were the main takeaways.\n1) There have been some rumblings Facebook could one day offer a paid service after Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said in an interview last week that the company doesn’t offer “an opt-out at the highest level…that would be a paid product.” Mr. Zuckerberg didn’t outright reject the idea of a paid product at the hearing either, saying that “ in general we believe the ad model is the right one for us ,” but “certainly we consider ideas like” a paid version.\n2) GDPR got its moment in the spotlight. Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook is committed to rolling out controls and affirmative consent options around the world, adding, “ I certainly think it’s worth discussing whether we should have something similar in the U.S. ” Senators, meanwhile, signaled they were prepared to embark on a new era of regulation for big tech companies.\n3) “You don’t think you have a monopoly?” said Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. “It certainly doesn’t feel like that to me,” Mr. Zuckerberg replied. (I wonder what he would have responded if he was asked about a “duopoly?”)\n4) Asked whether Facebook is a media company or a tech company, Mr. Zuckerberg of course plumped for the latter but did concede, “I agree that we’re responsible for the content, but we don’t produce the content.” Expect that line to be referenced for years to come. Will other digital media platforms agree they assume the same responsibility?\n5) You’ve likely encountered the rumor that Facebook is listening to your conversations via your phone’s microphone in order to serve highly targeted ads. Mr. Zuckerberg flatly denied the “conspiracy theory.” (And here’s a refresher on why it doesn’t need/want to .)\n—If You Had One Shot, One Opportunity—\nHow about Mr. Zuckerberg’s performance in the hot seat from a public-relations perspective? In a sense, Mr. Zuckerberg wasn’t just defending Facebook in front of the U.S. Senate, but, at some points, the core business model that drives many digital media and advertising businesses. He generally got the thumbs-up from crisis-communications experts , but Chris Allieri, principle of communications firm Mulberry & Astor, told me he thought there were missed opportunities to explain what Facebook stands for and wants to be known for in the future. “Instead he just passively answered questions presented to him,” Mr. Allieri said, noting that there also were many occasions when Mr. Zuckerberg deflected to his team to follow up with answers later. A prime example was when Mr. Zuckerberg was asked about whether the company can track a user’s browsing activity after the person has logged off Facebook. It can, and you’d have thought Mr. Zuckerberg could have easily explained that. “For a founder as close to his company and as smart as he is, this comes across as being too legally prepped, versus not being equipped to answer the questions—he just chose not to answer them,” Mr. Allieri said. Investors appeared convinced, however: Facebook’s shares closed up 4.5% on Tuesday.\nGimme Gimme More For most advertisers, YouTube is the go-to destination for their online video ad buys. Analysts suggest YouTube, which is estimated to generate anywhere from $11 billion to $20 billion of revenue this year, is the largest driver of Alphabet’s revenue outside of Google’s core business. Late last year, the Securities and Exchange Commission asked Alphabet why it doesn’t disclose its YouTube financials. Alphabet responded that its underlying advertising offering is the same across its entire business. That was enough for the SEC, but not some analysts and investors , WSJ reports. They argue that YouTube’s advertising is managed by a different business than the rest of Google’s ad offerings and that market demand for YouTube ads could fluctuate differently, too. YouTube has its own sales people, and the big YouTube brand safety boycott of last year didn’t really extend to Google’s other platforms. R.W. Baird’s Colin Sebastian predicted Alphabet will share YouTube numbers as soon as this year because the video business is now undervalued by investors. I’m sure advertisers and rival media owners would like to see those numbers, too.\nGo Native Spend on native advertising—ads that take on the look and characteristics of the content around them—has been growing at a double-digit clip over the past few years. Now, CMO Today’s Ben Mullin reports, that growth is slowing . EMarketer predicts spending on native ads in the U.S. will grow by 31% to $32.9 billion in 2018. Native ad spending rose around 50% last year and 64% in 2016. The large share of native ad spending comes from social platforms, but marketers aren’t able to continue increasing the allocation of their digital budgets for social as much as they had been previously—not least as overall advertising budgets aren’t expected to significantly rise. Nonsocial native—such as advertorials, in-feed units in news apps and rewarded video in gaming apps—is making up a greater share of native ad spend. Interestingly, Amazon is becoming an emerging driver of native advertising growth, thanks to a higher proportion of spending on its “sponsored products” format.\nLet’s Do It Like They Do on the Discovery Channel CMO Today’s Ben Mullin reports : Discovery Inc., the entity created by the merger of cable mainstays Discovery Communications and Scripps Networks, pitched advertisers at its first upfront as a combined company Tuesday. The big selling point was the combined scale and diversity of brands now housed under one corporate umbrella, including HGTV, Animal Planet and Motor Trend Network, the automotive-focused cable network formerly known as Velocity. Jon Steinlauf, chief U.S. advertising sales officer for Discovery Inc., positioned the new company’s cable channels as being insulated from the two trends that have spooked TV advertisers in recent years: time-shifting and cord-cutting. He noted that, unlike audiences for dramas and comedies, much Discovery’s viewers are watching live (and presumably viewing ads). And Mr. Steinlauf touted the reach of Group Nine Media, which Discovery has invested in and whose brands include Thrillist and the Dodo, saying the company “reaches 80% of U.S. adults in their 20s.”\nCorrection:\nAlterNet is being acquired by the owners of Raw Story. Tuesday’s newsletter incorrectly stated that AlterNet was being acquired by Raw Story. Apologies for the error.\nBest of the rest Sinclair Broadcast Group is facing resistance from the Federal Communications Commission as it seeks approval for its $3.9 billion acquisition of Tribune Media. [ WSJ ]\nThe European Commission confirmed its officials had raided the offices of several sports media rights companies Tuesday evening, including the London offices of Fox Networks Group, as part of a preliminary investigation into suspected anticompetitive practices. The commission said the raids didn’t mean the companies are guilty of anticompetitive behavior. (Fox Networks Group is a division of 21st Century Fox. 21st Century Fox and News Corp, the parent company of The Wall Street Journal, share common ownership.) [ Financial Times ]\nPiper Jaffray’s Teens Survey suggests 83% of U.S. teens open Snapchat monthly, while 82% of teens are monthly active Instagram users. However, 45% of those surveyed said Snapchat is their favorite social platform, compared with the 26% who said Instagram was their favorite. [ Business Insider ]\nAdvertising agency trade body the 4A’s and several holding company executives have launched the Advertiser Protection Bureau, a group that will focus on brand safety and “advertising assurance.” [ Adweek ]\nDJ Khaled edited or deleted some of his social media posts that mentioned alcohol brands after receiving a warning letter from a group of seven organizations including TruthInAdvertising.org, the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, Public Citizen and the Center for Digital Democracy. The letter alleged DJ Khaled wasn’t properly disclosing his brand endorsements in the posts and warned the alcohol promotions were inappropriately reaching minors. [ Ad Age ]\nReddit banned 944 accounts suspected to be linked to the Internet Research Agency Russian troll factory. But the site said few of those accounts “had a visible impact,” and its investigation found no election-related ads. [ Financial Times ]\nA CBS-backed startup called Givewith is introducing a product designed to make it easier for companies to donate to nonprofits as part of their digital ad buys. [ CMO Today ]\nMedia agency reviews are increasingly focusing deeply on the tech stack and agencies’ data offerings. “Reviews are getting longer, more in-depth, more frequent and more expensive.” [ AdExchanger ]\nAbout Us Follow us on Twitter: @wsjCMO , @larakiara , @VranicaWSJ , @alexbruell , @BenMullin , @srabil , @asharma\nSubscribe to our morning newsletter, delivered straight to your inbox, at http://on.wsj.com/CMOTodaySignup .\nWrite to Lara O’Reilly at lara.oreilly@wsj.com",
