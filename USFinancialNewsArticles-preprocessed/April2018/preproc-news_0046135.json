    "text": "April 25, 2018 / 9:05 AM / in an hour UPDATE 1-China to push rental housing asset-backed securitization Reuters Staff \n* China pledges to speed up ABS issuance process \n* Companies encouraged to apply based on own financial needs \n* Regulators will strengthen risk supervision (Adds details, context) \nBEIJING, April 25 (Reuters) - China will encourage companies to conduct rental housing asset-backed securitization, while strengthening supervision and management on such securities, the securities regulator said on Wednesday in a joint statement with the housing ministry. \nChina is working to support the rental market to help rein in hot property prices and satisfy housing demand, as President Xi Jinping reiterated that “houses are for living in, not for speculation.” \nWhile property prices have shot up, driven by speculation and demand from a growing middle class, China’s rental market has long been underdeveloped and largely remained unregulated, with rental yields easing to multi-year lows. \n“(We) encourage companies involved in the rental housing business to conduct asset securitization according to their operating conditions and based on their own financial needs,” the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said in the statement posted on its website. \nA “green channel” will be set up to speed up the issuance process, with the regulators pledging to create a favorable policy environment with better coordination among themselves, according to the statement. \nThe statement also specified conditions companies have to meet to qualify as issuers of such securities, including requirements that the underlying apartments must have been built and that the companies can demonstrate a clean record of abiding by relevant rules in the past two years. \nIt stressed regulators will properly evaluate the rental assets and hold intermediaries and issuers responsible. \nSecuritization in mid-tier and large cities, as well as the Xiongan new area - a special economic zone situated south of Beijing - will be a priority, the regulators added.
