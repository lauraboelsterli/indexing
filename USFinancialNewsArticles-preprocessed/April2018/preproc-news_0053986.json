REUTERS/Ilya Naymushin/File Photo\nThe sources, familiar with the developments but who asked not to be named because they are not allowed to speak publicly on the issue, said Rusal would soon appoint a fully independent board, which in turn would appoint a new management team.\n“Rusal is in touch with U.S. authorities and hopes the measure will be enough for them to be removed from the sanctions list,” one of the two sources said.\nThe source added Rusal also hoped its top shareholder Oleg Deripaska, who was put alongside Rusal on a U.S. Specially Designated Nationals blacklist, could keep his stake in the firm at 48 percent under the arrangement.\n“Forty eight percent is not a controlling stake of 50 percent, which under the U.S. rules triggers the sanctions,” the source said.\nThe source added Rusal, the world’s second largest aluminum producer, was still not shipping to customers around the world awaiting guidance from U.S. authorities.
