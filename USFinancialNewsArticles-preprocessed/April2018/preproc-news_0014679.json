    "text": "PRAGUE (Reuters) - The Czech Republic will issue a tender for 12 army helicopters in the summer, Defence Minister Karla Slechtova said on Monday.\nBell Helicopter, a unit of Textron, and Italy’s Leonardo had submitted offers last year for the sale of the helicopters, but Slechtova scrapped the tender after taking office in December.\n“We won’t go to a single company... We will address three bidders at least. We will complete the documentation and launch the tender in the summer,” Slechtova said on Twitter.\nThe U.S. Department of Defense issued a release last October estimating the cost of the deal for 12 Bell UH-1Y utility helicopters at $575 million.\nReporting by Robert Muller; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ",
