    "text": "MEXICO CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BECLE, S.A.B. de C.V. (“Cuervo”, “BECLE” or the “Company”) (BMV: CUERVO) today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nAll figures in this release are derived from the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company as of March 31, 2018 and for the three-month period then ended and are prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” of the International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS), which have been published in the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores (BMV).\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nNet Sales decreased 12.7% to P$4,307 million pesos; Volume decreased 3.9% as short-term declines in the US and Canada offset growth in Mexico and the Rest of World regions; Gross margin decreased to 61.4%; Operating profit decreased to P$957 million pesos; EBITDA decreased to P$1,074 million pesos, and EBITDA margin decreased to 24.9%; and Consolidated net income decreased to P$142 million pesos, resulting in earnings per share of P$0.04.\nAll abovementioned increases and decreases have been determined in comparison to the corresponding period in the preceding year.\nManagement Commentary\nFirst quarter volume and net sales growth were challenged by short-term declines in the US along with the negative impact of foreign currency, partially offset by strong growth in Mexico and the rest of the world. The volume decline in the US relates to last year’s price increase, which affected our ability to forecast depletions early in the quarter, leading to volatility in our shipments. However, the quarter ended with strong depletion growth in March and we expect future quarters will no longer be impacted by the comparisons to last year’s price increase. Our strong momentum in Mexico continued during the first quarter and we continued to expand our market share leadership. The short-term impact on US volume led to pressure on first quarter earnings, which is expected to recover as volume trends return to normal. We remain confident in achieving our 2018 goals.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, total volume declined 3.9% to 3.4 million nine-liter cases driven by a 16.9% decline in the United States and Canada, partially offset by a 17.1% increase in sales volumes in Mexico and a 14.2% increase in the Rest of World (RoW) region. Volume growth in the Mexico benefited from favorable promotions during the quarter and growth across all channels, along with the timing of Holy Week during the quarter. Volume decreased in the United States and Canada as a result of an unanticipated year over year decline in depletions as a result of last year’s price increase that led to higher retailer purchasing activity in the prior year’s first quarter as retailers continued to capture favorable pricing from distributor inventory established prior to the January 1, 2017 price increase.\nVolume by Region 1Q18 (in 000s nine-liter cases)\nREGION 1Q18 1Q17 (VAR.% YOY) 4Q17 (VAR.% QOQ) US & CANADA 1,799 2,166 -16.9 % 3,114 -42.2 % MEXICO 1,119 956 17.1 % 2,576 -56.6 % ROW\n515 451 14.2 % 726 -29.1 % TOTAL 3,433 3,572 -3.9 % 6,417 -46.5 % Net sales decreased 12.7% to P$4,307 million pesos compared to the same period in 2017. Net sales in the United States and Canada decreased 22.7% versus the same period last year as a result of the volume decline and the negative impact of foreign currency given the relative strength of the Mexican Peso vs. the US Dollar. The foreign currency impact led to a 8.1% reduction in reported US sales value. In the same period, Mexico net sales increased by 2.2% over the prior year period as a result of strong volume growth, partially offset by a change in how certain sales support and promotional costs are accounted for in this region. A portion of these costs are now netted against gross sales, resulting in lower reported net sales without any impact on net profit. Net sales of the RoW increased by 18.2% over the first quarter of 2017.\nNet Sales by Region 1Q18 (in MXN$ millions)\nREGION 1Q18 1Q17 (VAR.% YOY) 4Q17 (VAR.% QOQ) US & CANADA 2,588 3,346 -22.7 % 4,903 -47.2 % MEXICO 981 960 2.2 % 2,461 -60.1 % ROW 738 624 18.2 % 975 -24.3 % TOTAL 4,307 4,930 -12.7 % 8,338 -48.4 % Volume of Jose Cuervo decreased 9.7% compared the same period in 2017 and represented 29.8% of total volume for the first quarter of 2018. The Company’s Other Tequila brands represented 14.7% of total volume with volume decreasing 5.7% compared to the prior year period. The Company’s Other Spirits brands represented 20.8% of total volume in the period and experienced a 13.6% increase in volume over the first quarter of last year. Volume of Non-alcoholic and Other represented 22.7% of total volume and volume and grew 1.0% compared to the prior year period. Volume of ready-to-drink (RTDs) represented 12.0% of total volume and decreased by 18.3% compared to the prior year period. The volume declines in Jose Cuervo, Other Tequilas and RTD reflected the short-term volume declines in the US & Canada related to last year’s price increase and its impact on year over year growth.\nVolume by Category 1Q18 (in 000s nine-liter cases)\nCATEGORY 1Q18 1Q17 (VAR.% YOY) 4Q17 (VAR.% QOQ) JOSE CUERVO 1,022 1,132 -9.7 % 2,136 -52.2 % OTHER TEQUILAS 506 536 -5.7 % 1,126 -55.1 % OTHER SPIRITS 713 627 13.6 % 1,416 -49.7 % NON-ALCOHOLIC & OTHER 780 772 1.0 % 1,163 -32.9 % RTD\n412 504 -18.3 % 575 -28.4 % TOTAL 3,433 3,572 -3.9 % 6,417 -46.5 % Net Sales of Jose Cuervo decreased 21.2% compared the same period in 2017 and represented 31.2% of total net sales for the first quarter of 2018.

Net sales of ready-to-drink (RTDs) represented 7.7% of total net sales and reported a decrease of 24.8% compared to the prior year period. The net sales declines in Jose Cuervo, Other Tequilas, Non-alcoholic & Other and RTD reflected a combination of reduced volume driven by the short-term volume declines in the US & Canada related to last year’s price increase and its impact on year over year growth, as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign currency.\nNet sales by Category 1Q18 (in MXN$ millions)\nCATEGORY 1Q18 1Q17 (VAR.% YOY) 4Q17 (VAR.% QOQ) JOSE CUERVO 1,342 1,703 -21.2 % 2,960 -54.7 % OTHER TEQUILAS 908 1,003 -9.5 % 2,181 -58.4 % OTHER SPIRITS 1,105 941 17.4 % 1,939 -43.0 % NON-ALCOHOLIC & OTHER 622 845 -26.4 % 749 -16.9 % RTD 330 439 -24.8 % 509 -35.3 % TOTAL 4,307 4,930 -12.7 % 8,338 -48.4 % Gross profit during the first quarter of 2018 decreased 17.8% over the same period in 2017 to P$2,645 million pesos. Gross margin as a percent of sales was 61.4% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 65.2% for the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin was negatively impacted by the Company utilizing a lower percentage of internally sourced agave, the change in treatment of certain promotional and sales support expenses as a reduction of sales and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency.\nAdvertising, marketing and promotion (AMP) decreased 10.4% to P$830 million pesos when compared to the first quarter of 2017. As a percentage of net sales, AMP increased to 19.3% from 18.8% in the prior year period. The increase reflects the impact of lower than expected sales volume and the planned timing of AMP spend.\nOperating profit during the first quarter of 2018 decreased 36.1% to P$957 million pesos compared to the same period last year. Operating margin as a percentage of sales decreased to 22.2% as compared to 30.4% in the prior year period, reflecting lower gross margin, higher AMP and distribution expense, and higher selling, general & administrative expenses (SG&A), all as a percentage of net sales.\nEBITDA in the first quarter of 2018 decreased to P$1,074 million pesos compared to P$1,609 million pesos during the first quarter of 2017.\nNet Comprehensive Financing result was P$779 million pesos during the first quarter as a result of the appreciation of the Mexican Peso vs. the US Dollar during the quarter and the related impact on the Company’s net cash balance, which is primarily held in US Dollars.\nConsolidated net income in the first quarter of 2018 was P$142 million pesos, compared to P$437 million pesos the prior year period. Earnings per share were P$0.04 in the first quarter of 2018.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nAs of March 31, 2018, Net cash was P$5,621 million pesos, reflecting cash and equivalents of P$14,715 million pesos relative to total debt of P$9,093 million pesos. The Company’s total debt primarily reflects the Company’s $500 million U.S. dollar bond due in 2025.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company invested P$34 million pesos in capital expenditures and utilized P$335 million for share repurchases.\nConference Call\nThe Company plans to host a conference call for investors at 8:00 a.m. Central Time (9:00 a.m. Eastern Time) on Friday, April 27, 2018, to discuss the Company’s first quarter 2018 financial results.

We calculate EBITDA as net income plus depreciation and amortization, income tax expense, and interest expense, less interest income, plus foreign exchange loss (gain).\nEBITDA is not a IFRS measure of liquidity or performance, nor is EBITDA recognized financial measures under IFRS. We believe that EBITDA can be useful to facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods on a combined basis, but these metrics may be calculated differently by other issuers. EBITDA should not be construed as alternatives to (i) net income as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance or (ii) cash flow from operating activities as a measure of the Company’s liquidity.\nDisclaimer\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements which are based on Becle’s current expectations and observations.
