While the largest state-owned banks have seen falling bad debt, their smaller peers are likely to see a growing pile-up as borrowers falter.\nChen also said China Orient AMC has raised 18 billion yuan in investment from China Telecom Corp Ltd, Shanghai Electric Group Co Ltd, National Council for Social Security Fund and China Reform Capital Corp.\n“The fundraising was larger than expected,” said Yueming Jiang, China Orient AMC director of strategic investment and listing.\nThe total stake of the four investors comprises less than 20 percent of the company, at around 2 percent to 6 percent each.\nThe firm said it will use the funds to boost capital adequacy.\nChina Orient AMC “will use other tools to boost capital this year,” said senior executive Liu Bo.\nChina Orient AMC, one of the country’s so-called Big Four distressed asset managers, was originally set up as Bank of China Ltd’s bad bank to digest its soured debt in the late 90s.
