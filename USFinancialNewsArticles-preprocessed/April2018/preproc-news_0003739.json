    "text": "April 1, 2018 / 4:14 PM / Updated an hour ago Eintracht lose at Bremen to drop back in Champions League race Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBERLIN (Reuters) - Eintracht Frankfurt slumped to a 2-1 defeat at Werder Bremen on Sunday to miss their chance to move back up into the Bundesliga top three as they battle for a Champions League spot. \nDavid Abraham’s looping header towards his own goal to clear a Zlatko Junuzovic free kick saw keeper Lukas Hradecky let the ball slip through his hands for an unlikely Bremen winner and their third win in a row. \nEarlier, Junuzovic had put the hosts ahead in the first half but Luka Jovic volleyed in from a superb Kevin-Prince Boateng backheel flick for the equaliser. \nFrankfurt drop to sixth on 45 points, as many as Bayer Leverkusen and one behind fourth-placed RB Leipzig. \nThe top four teams qualify for next season’s Champions League group stage. \nLeaders Bayern Munich are a win away from securing their sixth successive Bundesliga title after demolishing Borussia Dortmund 6-0 on Saturday courtesy of a Robert Lewandowski hat-trick.
