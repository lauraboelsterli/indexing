    "text": "UNITED NATIONS, April 17 (Reuters) - Syrian U.N. Ambassador Bashar Ja’afari said a United Nations security team traveled to the Syrian town of Douma on Tuesday ahead of a planned visit by international chemical weapons experts on Wednesday to look into a suspected toxic gas attack.\n“Today the U.N. security team entered Douma ... in order to assess the security situation on the ground and if this United Nations security team decided that the situation is sound in Douma then the fact-finding mission will begin its work in Douma tomorrow,” Ja’afari told the U.N. Security Council.\n“The Syrian government did all that it can do to facilitate the work of this mission,” he said.\nReporting by Michelle Nichols Editing by Toni Reinhold\n ",
