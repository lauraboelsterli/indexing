    "text": "April 3, 2018 / 5:09 PM / Updated an hour ago Trump says U.S. subsidizes Amazon for shipping Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday said the United States is subsidizing Amazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ) and that the online retailer must pay more to ship its products through the nation’s postal agency. FILE PHOTO: An Amazon.com Inc driver stands next to an Amazon delivery truck in Los Angeles, California, U.S., May 21, 2016. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo \nTrump, citing an unnamed report, told reporters at the White House that the U.S. Postal Service “delivers packages for Amazon at a very low rate,” adding: “If you look at the cost that we’re subsidizing, we’re giving a subsidy to Amazon.” Reporting by Steve Holland and Lisa Lambert; Writing by Susan Heavey; Editing by Tim Ahmann",
