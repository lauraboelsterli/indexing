What drove the fluctuation in the effective tax rate?\nOur effective income tax rate was 23.9% and 20.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively. Although the statutory U.S. income tax rate applicable to corporations decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the Tax Act that was enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017, our effective income tax rate 2017 was lower than the first quarter of 2018 because the prior year period was more favorably impacted by the tax benefit from equity awards and the settlement of an income tax examination.\n4. What is included in the costs related to the September 2017 cybersecurity incident?\nCosts related to the cybersecurity incident are defined as incremental costs to transform our Information Technology Infrastructure and Data Security; legal fees and professional services costs to investigate the cybersecurity incident and respond to legal, government and regulatory claims; as well as costs to provide the free product and related support to the consumer.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we recorded $68.7 million ($50.6 million, net of tax) for expenses related to the cybersecurity incident and incremental information technology (\"IT\") and data security costs.

The $45.7 million of IT and data security costs include incremental costs to transform our IT infrastructure and improve application, network, and data security, and the costs of development and launch of Lock and Alert TM . These include, but are not limited to, costs for people, professional and contracted services, technical services and products, and other costs added either directly or indirectly to manage, execute, and support the implementation of these plans. The $28.9 million of legal and investigative fees include legal fees and professional services costs to investigate the cybersecurity incident and respond to legal, government, and regulatory investigations and claims related to the cybersecurity incident. The $4.1 million of product liability costs include the expected costs of fulfillment of TrustedID Premier and support of consumers using TrustedID Premier.\nSince the announcement of the cybersecurity incident in September 2017, we have incurred a total of $242.7 million of expenses related to the incident and incremental IT and data security costs.\nWe maintain $125 million of cybersecurity insurance coverage, above a $7.5 million deductible, to limit our exposure to losses such as those related to the cybersecurity incident. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company has recorded a receivable of $10.0 million.

During the first quarter of 2017, we recorded acquisition-related amortization expense of certain acquired intangibles of $45.0 million ($36.4 million, net of tax). The $8.6 million of tax is comprised of $14.8 million of tax expense net of $6.2 million of a cash income tax benefit. See the Notes to this reconciliation for additional detail.\n(2) During the first quarter of 2018, we recorded $68.7 million ($50.6 million, net of tax) for expenses related to the cybersecurity incident.

See the Notes to this reconciliation for additional detail.\nNotes to Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the Comparable GAAP Financial Measures\nDiluted EPS attributable to Equifax is adjusted for the following items:\nAcquisition-related amortization expense - We calculate this financial measure by excluding the impact of acquisition-related amortization expense and including a benefit to reflect the material cash income tax savings resulting from the income tax deductibility of amortization for certain acquired intangibles. These financial measures are not prepared in conformity with GAAP. Management believes excluding the impact of amortization expense is useful because excluding acquisition-related amortization, and other items that are not comparable, allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Certain acquired intangibles result in material cash income tax savings which are not reflected in earnings. Management believes that including a benefit to reflect the cash income tax savings is useful as it allows investors to better value Equifax. Management makes these adjustments to earnings when measuring profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital.\nAccrual for costs related to the cybersecurity incident - We recorded $68.7 million ($50.6 million, net of tax) during the first quarter of 2018 associated with the costs to investigate the cybersecurity incident, legal fees to respond to subsequent litigation, costs to deliver the free product offering made to all U.S. consumers and incremental costs to transform our Information Technology Infrastructure and Data Security. Management believes excluding this charge is useful as it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Management makes these adjustments to net income when measuring profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.\nVeda acquisition related amounts for transaction and due diligence expenses incurred as a direct result of the acquisition, as well as integration expense in the first year following the closure of the acquisition - During the first quarter of 2017, we recorded $11.4 million ($9.0 million, net of tax, which includes a valuation allowance adjustment of $1.0 million reflected in income tax) for Veda acquisition related amounts other than acquisition-related amortization, of which $11.7 million related to integration costs in operating income, and $0.3 million related to foreign currency gain included in other income, net. Management believes excluding this charge is useful as it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Management makes these adjustments to net income when measuring profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.\nIncome tax effects of stock awards that are recognized upon vesting or settlement - During the first quarter of 2018, we recorded a tax benefit of $3.0 million related to the tax effects of deductions for stock compensation in excess of amounts recorded for compensation costs. During the first quarter of 2017, we recorded a tax benefit of $14.9 million related to the tax effects of deductions for stock compensation expense in excess of amounts recorded for compensation costs. Management believes excluding this tax effect from financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 because this amount is non-operating and relates to income tax benefits or deficiencies for stock awards recognized when tax amounts differ from recognized stock compensation cost. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.\nAdjustments for uncertain tax positions - During the first quarter of 2017, we recorded a tax benefit of $8.3 million related to adjustments from uncertain tax positions resulting from the completion of examinations of historical tax returns. Management believes excluding this tax effect from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2017 because a benefit of such an amount is not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin - Management defines adjusted EBITDA as consolidated net income attributable to Equifax plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and also excludes certain one-time items. Management believes the use of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/equifax-releases-first-quarter-results-300636618.html\nSOURCE Equifax Inc.",
