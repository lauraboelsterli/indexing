Follow us on Twitter at @WSJRisk.\nSacha Saban, director of corporate governance, Legal and General Investment Management. Legal and General Investment Management Good morning. Asset-management firm Legal and General Investment Management will deploy the power of its shareholder votes to reinforce to corporate chiefs the message that climate risk matters, said Sacha Sadan, the firm’s director of corporate governance.\nLGIM is one of the largest asset managers in Europe, with nearly £1 trillion under management. One-third of the firm’s meetings in 2017 with leaders of its portfolio companies focused on climate change. After those meetings LGIM will vote against chairmen at companies that failed to disclose climate risk-mitigation strategies, said Mr. Sadan.\n“This will be the year we will vote against some of the people at companies that haven’t disclosed enough on climate risk…that haven’t shown how they will survive in a low-carbon economy,” he said. “Where we can we will divest those stocks.”\nThe firm continues to turn up the heat on companies to make sure they understand the implications of climate change—how they contribute to it and how they can benefit from it. LGIM last year supported 95% of shareholder resolutions on climate change, said Mr. Sadan.\nLGIM will publish a ranking next month of the “leaders and laggards” in corporate action on climate, said Mr. Sadan. “This will clearly tell [directors] why we are voting against them,” he said.\nBoard composition remains a central issue for LGIM after the firm increased its votes against directors in 2017, said Mr. Sadan.\n“We are looking at board quality, board independence and whether the board has the right talent,” he said. Information flows much faster than in the past, and the pressures on large global companies are much greater, so a board needs to have the skills to meet these challenges, he said.\nLGIM again will emphasize board independence, as Mr. Sadan said people who serve on a board for 15 years or more shouldn’t be considered independent. LGIM voted against the election or re-election of 2,807 directors last year, up from 2,362 in 2016.\n“We voted against more U.S. directors last year than ever before,” said Mr. Sadan.\nEXCLUSIVE ON RISK AND COMPLIANCE JOURNAL\nU.K. to dig into property ownership. Foreign entities that own property in the U.K. will need to disclose the beneficial owners of the assets in a public register or face criminal charges under a proposed law. Parliament will draw up legislation for the register this year.\nCOMPLIANCE\nU.S. rejects more Russia sanctions. President Donald Trump has decided against imposing new sanctions on Russia, at least for now, the NYT reports. Nikki R. Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Sunday the U.S. would sanction companies that aided Syria’s chemical-weapons program.\nBeijing eases foreign-auto rules. China said it will let electric-car companies operate there without local partners this year. It will establish a schedule for allowing other auto makers to run their own factories there in coming years, the NYT reports.\nChina targets U.S. sorghum. China will impose surcharges on imports of U.S. sorghum. The Ministry of Commerce said it would require importers to pay deposits worth 178.6% of the value of U.S. sorghum shipments. The preliminary ruling takes effect Wednesday, the WSJ reports.\nU.S. seeks to press China on tech. The U.S. is examining ways to retaliate against Beijing’s restrictions on U.S. providers of cloud computing and other high-tech services, effectively opening a new front on its trade offensive against China, the WSJ reports.\nTrump to nominate CFTC commissioner. President Donald Trump intends to nominate Dan Berkovitz, a former Commodity Futures Trading Commission general counsel, to fill the final open slot on the commission, the White House said Monday, the WSJ reports.\nCryptocurrency exchange to leave Japan. The San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken is ending its trading services for Japanese residents after regulators stepped up oversight in the country, the WSJ reports.\nA bitcoin ad looming over pedestrians near Tokyo’s Shibuya train station in February.

The warning appeared to be an effort to reduce the risk of attacks by pushing people to address vulnerabilities and threatening to retaliate, the NYT reports.\nTaskRabbit discloses cybersecurity incident. TaskRabbit , an online marketplace for freelance labor that is part of Swedish furniture chain IKEA , said it has been hit by cybercriminals. TaskRabbit took down its website and app and urged customers to change their passwords, the WSJ reports.\nREPUTATION\nKorean Air executive is in hot water. South Korean police are investigating allegations Cho Hyun-min, a Korean Air Lines Co. vice president and daughter of the company’s chairman, threw water in the face of an ad-agency employee at a meeting. The airline said Ms. Cho threw the water, but denied it was aimed at a person.\nOPERATIONS\nTesla stops Model 3 output again. Tesla has again halted production of the Model 3 sedan, days after Chief Executive Elon Musk said the auto maker’s pace of making 2,000 of the sedans a week is sustainable. The Silicon Valley company has fallen behind schedule in building its first mass-market car.\nA Model 3 sits on the showroom floor at a Tesla dealership in Chicago last month.

Sanofi , the French healthcare company, is in exclusive talks to sell its Zentiva European generic-drugs unit to Advent International , a private-equity firm, for €1.9 billion ($2.4 billion), Reuters reports.\nShare this: Advent International beneficial ownership Berkovitz CFTC china cars china sorghum China trade Cho Hyun-min Elon Musk IKEA Korean Air Kraken Legal and General Investment Management LGIM Nikki Haley Russia sanctions Sacha Sadan Sanofi TaskRabbit Tesla Previous Corruption Currents: Fight vs. Graft Topped Americas Summit Content from our sponsor Deloitte Risk management, strategy and analysis from Deloitte CFOs’ Optimism Swells in Wake of US Tax Reform: CFO Signals CFOs’ assessments of key business metrics have risen to multiyear highs, largely on skyrocketing optimism in the U.S., according to Deloitte’s first-quarter 2018 CFO Signals™ survey. Expectations for growth in revenue, earnings, capital investment and domestic hiring all increased from Q4 2017, with domestic hiring expectations setting a new survey record. \"The latest survey results show that CFOs continue to be strongly optimistic, and their confidence is further bolstered by the passage of tax reform in the U.S.,” says Sanford Cockrell III, national managing partner of the U.S. CFO Program, Deloitte LLP.\nPlease note: The Wall Street Journal News Department was not involved in the creation of the content above.
