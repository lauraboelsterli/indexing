    "text": "GHAZNI, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Taliban militants over-ran a district in Afghanistan’s Ghazni province on Thursday, killing more than a dozen people including the district’s governor before retreating, a police official said.\nAfghan National Army (ANA) soldiers stand guard at the check post in Khawaja Omari district of Ghazni province, Afghanistan April 12, 2018. REUTERS/Stringer Ghazni’s Khawaja Omari district was considered one of the province’s safest areas.\nThe militants killed district governor Ali Dost Shams, his bodyguards, seven police and five government intelligence agents, said Ramazan Ali Mohseni, deputy police chief in Ghazni. At least 45 to 50 militants were killed, he said.\nThe Taliban then torched the district headquarters, he said. Later, the Taliban left the headquarters and government security forces returned.\nBodies wrapped in blankets were laid on the ground of the district compound by late Thursday morning.\nTaliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement 20 police officers were killed in the attack.\nKhawaja Omari is near the provincial capital, also called Ghazni, a city of 150,000 people 150 km (95 miles) southwest of the Afghan capital, Kabul.\nFighting in Afghanistan traditionally increases in the spring when warmer weather melts snow blocking mountain passes, increasing the mobility of the insurgents.\nThe Taliban usually announce the launch of a spring offensive in April.\nReporting by Mustafa Andalib in Ghazni, Afghanistan; Writing by Rod Nickel; Editing by Nick Macfie\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
