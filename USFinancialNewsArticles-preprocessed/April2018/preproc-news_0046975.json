    "text": "LEAWOOD, Kan., April 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Euronet Worldwide, Inc. (“Euronet” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:EEFT), a leading electronic payments provider, reports first quarter 2018 financial results.\nEuronet reports the following consolidated results for the first quarter 2018 compared with the same period of 2017:\nRevenues of $550.5 million, a 16% increase from $473.4 million (7% increase on a constant currency (1) basis). Operating income of $45.5 million, a 10% increase from $41.3 million (no change on a constant currency basis). Adjusted operating income (2) of $45.5 million, a 7% increase from $42.5 million (3% decrease on a constant currency basis). Adjusted EBITDA (3) of $75.5 million, an 11% increase from $67.8 million (1% increase on a constant currency basis). Net income attributable to Euronet of $26.4 million or $0.49 diluted earnings per share, compared with net income of $28.1 million or $0.51 diluted earnings per share. Adjusted earnings per share (4) of $0.73, no change from $0.73. Transactions of 904 million, a 5% increase from 865 million.\n\"I am pleased we continued to deliver double-digit revenue growth in the first quarter,\" stated Michael J. Brown, Euronet's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"The investments made in the EFT and Money Transfer segments through operating costs and capital expenditures have positioned the Company for continued revenue and earnings growth in the future. Epay contributed modest earnings growth on a constant dollar basis from non-mobile expansion to offset mobile declines and effective cost management.\"\nFirst quarter revenue reflects the prospective adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 (ASC 606) which resulted in a decrease in the reporting of certain epay revenues along with a decrease in direct costs resulting in no change in gross profit. Without the adoption of this accounting standard beginning in the first quarter 2018, consolidated revenues would have increased 21% on a reported basis and 11% on a constant currency basis.\nSee the reconciliation of non-GAAP items in the attached financial schedules.\nSegment and Other Results\nThe EFT Processing Segment reports the following results for the first quarter 2018 compared with the same period or date in 2017:\nRevenues of $135.7 million, a 28% increase from $105.8 million (15% increase on a constant currency basis). Operating income of $11.5 million, a 5% increase from $11.0 million (no change on a constant currency basis). Adjusted EBITDA of $27.7 million, a 21% increase from $22.8 million (11% increase on a constant currency basis). Transactions of 622 million, a 16% increase from 537 million. Operated 38,358 ATMs as of March 31, 2018, a 9% increase from 35,145.\nFirst quarter constant currency revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth was largely the result of a 9% year-over-year increase in active ATMs, a 16% increase in transactions and the prior year negative impact related to India demonetization efforts. The increases in ATMs and transactions were primarily from growth in Europe and India - including an increase in the number of value added transactions on both ATMs and point-of-sale terminals. The EFT Segment's addition of 812 high-value ATMs contributed to higher operating costs during the seasonally weaker first quarter, but positions the segment for a continuation of strong revenue growth throughout the seasonally stronger second, third and fourth quarters.\nThe epay Segment reports the following results for the first quarter 2018 compared with the same period or date in 2017:\nRevenues of $176.8 million, an 8% increase from $164.2 million (1% decrease on a constant currency basis). Operating income of $16.9 million, a 22% increase from $13.9 million (8% increase on a constant currency basis). Adjusted EBITDA of $18.8 million, a 15% increase from $16.4 million (2% increase on a constant currency basis). Transactions of 258 million, a 16% decrease from 308 million. Point-of-sale (\"POS\") terminals of approximately 689,000 as of March 31, 2018, a 3% increase from approximately 666,000. Retailer locations of approximately 326,000 as of March 31, 2018, a 6% increase from approximately 308,000.\nWithout the prospective adoption of ASC 606 beginning in the first quarter 2018, epay revenues would have increased 21% on a reported basis and 9% on a constant currency basis.\nepay first quarter constant currency revenue, operating income and adjusted EBITDA growth was primarily the result of increased sales of non-mobile products, partially offset by certain mobile transaction declines. The 16% decline in transactions was largely the result of the loss of a high-volume, low-margin mobile customer in the Middle East.\nThe Money Transfer Segment reports the following results for the first quarter 2018 compared with the same period or date in 2017:\nRevenues of $238.9 million, a 17% increase from $203.9 million (11% increase on a constant currency basis). Operating income of $26.5 million, a 2% increase from $26.1 million (7% decrease on a constant currency basis). Adjusted EBITDA of $34.4 million, a 3% increase from $33.4 million (5% decrease on a constant currency basis). Total transactions of 24.3 million, a 17% increase from 20.7 million. Network locations of approximately 350,000 as of March 31, 2018, a 9% increase from approximately 321,000.\nDouble-digit constant currency revenue growth was driven by growth across most sectors of the Ria business, with notable strength coming from Digital, the Middle East, Europe and Malaysia, together with continued expansion of the Xe international payments business. Operating income and adjusted EBITDA were adversely impacted by the price reduction included in the April 2017 extension of the Walmart agreement, settlement of a legal dispute, expansion of the India payout network and an agent contract renegotiation.\nFirst quarter money transfers grew 17% and non-transfer transactions, such as currency exchange and check cashing, grew 22%, resulting in total transaction growth of 17%.\nCorporate and Other reports $9.4 million of expense for the first quarter 2018 compared with $9.7 million for the first quarter 2017. Excluding costs related to the proposed MoneyGram transaction, adjusted operating expense would have been $8.5 million for the first quarter 2017. Increased corporate expense is largely due to increased share-based compensation expense and professional fees.\nIncome tax expense under generally accepted accounting principles was $13.7 million and $9.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in income tax expense was largely attributable to certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) signed into law on December 22, 2017 in the United States. While the new tax legislation lowered corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%, it included provisions which required the full utilization of the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards to largely cover taxes on prior year undistributed foreign earnings as well as the provision for taxation of global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI).\nBalance Sheet and Financial Position\nUnrestricted cash on hand was $885.6 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to $819.1 million as of December 31, 2017. The increase in cash is due to borrowings under our revolving credit facility and cash generated from operations, partially offset by share repurchases, ATM cash requirements, capital expenditures and settlement timing in the business.\nTotal indebtedness was $635.0 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to $460.5 million as of December 31, 2017. Debt increased mainly as a result of borrowings under our revolving credit facility due to higher seasonal ATM cash requirements.\nGuidance\nThe Company currently expects adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter 2018, assuming foreign currency exchange rates and the Company's share price remain stable through the end of the quarter, to be approximately $1.32.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn addition to the results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company presents non-GAAP financial measures, such as constant currency financial measures, adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. These measures should be used in addition to, and not a substitute for, revenues, net income, operating income and earnings per share computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors regarding the Company's performance and overall results of operations. These non-GAAP measures are also an integral part of the Company's internal reporting and performance assessment for executives and senior management. The non-GAAP measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The attached schedules provide a full reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure.\nThe Company does not provide a reconciliation of its forward-looking non-GAAP measures to GAAP due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for GAAP and the related GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation, including adjustments that would be necessary for currency exchange rate fluctuations and other charges reflected in the Company's reconciliation of historic numbers, the amount of which, based on historical experience, could be significant.\n(1) Constant currency financial measures are computed as if foreign currency exchange rates did not change from the prior period. This information is provided to illustrate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the Company's results when compared to the prior period.\n(2) Adjusted operating income is defined as operating income excluding expenses related to the proposed MoneyGram acquisition.\n(3) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income excluding interest, income tax expense, depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation, expenses related to the proposed MoneyGram acquisition, and other non-operating or non-recurring items that are considered expenses or income under U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA represents a performance measure and is not intended to represent a liquidity measure.\n(4) Adjusted earnings per share is defined as diluted U.S. GAAP earnings per share excluding, to the extent incurred in the period, the tax-effected impacts of: a) foreign currency exchange gains or losses, b) goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, c) gains or losses from the early retirement of debt, d) share-based compensation, e) acquired intangible asset amortization, f) expenses related to the proposed MoneyGram acquisition, g) non-cash interest expense, h) non-cash income tax expense, i) certain impacts of the tax reform legislation passed in 2017, and j) other non-operating or non-recurring items. Adjusted earnings per share represents a performance measure and is not intended to represent a liquidity measure.\nConference Call and Slide Presentation\nEuronet Worldwide will host an analyst conference call on April 25, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss these results.
