    "text": "Declares 1 st Quarterly Dividend of $0.25 Per Share\nROCKVILLE, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Argan, Inc. (NYSE: AGX) (“Argan” or the “Company”) today announced financial results for its fiscal year and fourth quarter ended January 31, 2018. For additional information, please read the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which the Company intends to file today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The Annual Report can be retrieved from the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov or from the Company’s website at www.arganinc.com .\nSummary Information: (in thousands, except per share data):\nJanuary 31,\n2018\n2017\nChange\n% Change\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended: Revenues $ 892,815 $ 675,047 $ 217,768 32 % Gross profit 149,325 146,711 2,614 2 Gross margins 16.7%\n21.7%\n(5.0)%\n(23 ) Net income attributable to the stockholders of the Company $ 72,011 $ 70,328 $ 1,683 2 Diluted per share 4.56 4.50 0.06 1 EBITDA attributable to the stockholders of the Company 116,101 110,640 5,461 5 Diluted per share 7.36 7.08 0.28 4 As of: Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 434,015 $ 522,994 $ (88,979 ) (17 )%\nBillings in excess of costs and estimated earnings 108,388 209,241 (100,853 ) (48 ) Project Backlog 379,000\n1,011,000 (632,000 ) (63 ) Fiscal Year 2018 Results:\nRevenues increased to an annual record of $893 million, up 32% compared to the prior year, primarily due to the ramped-up, peak and post-peak construction activities of Gemma Power Systems (GPS) on four large, natural gas-fired power plants. The power industry services segment represented 91% of consolidated revenues for the year ended January 31, 2018, or Fiscal 2018. Gross profit increased 2% to $149 million, primarily due to the increased revenues, while our gross margin percentage decreased from 21.7% to 16.7% compared to the prior year, reflecting the effects of increased labor and subcontractor cost estimates in the latter part of the current year for certain projects and the changes in the mix, progress and gross margin levels of multiple power plant projects.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $9 million to $42 million, primarily in support of increased project work, but decreased as a percentage of revenues to 4.7% from 4.8% in the prior year. Other income increased $3 million year over year, due to higher yields and increased short-term investment balances. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests decreased $7 million, or 95%, as we reached contractual completion on two large power plants built by joint ventures in the prior year.\nThese factors, partially offset by a net increase in the effective income tax rate, resulted in net income attributable to our stockholders for Fiscal 2018 increasing 2% to $72 million, or $4.56 per diluted share, from $70 million, or $4.50 per diluted share, compared to the prior year. EBITDA attributable to our stockholders for Fiscal 2018 also increased 5% to $116 million, or $7.36 per diluted share, from $111 million, or $7.08 per diluted share, for the prior year.\nOur balance sheet continues to be strong. As of January 31, 2018, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $434 million and net liquidity was $302 million; plus, we had no bank debt.\nOur project backlog was $379 million as of January 31, 2018, down from $1.0 billion at the end of the prior year. The decrease reflects work progress on existing contracts during Fiscal 2018 partially offset with the value of new project awards in the United Kingdom for Atlantic Projects Company (APC). Although we did not add a new major EPC contract for GPS during Fiscal 2018, we were pleased to add a 475 MW EPC project to backlog shortly after year-end. We are encouraged about the GPS project pipeline as GPS has been selected to perform the EPC work for several new power generation facilities with a collective potential project value in excess of $1.5 billion and projected start dates ranging from mid-2018 through 2019.\nFourth Quarter Results:\nRevenues decreased 18% compared to the prior year’s fourth quarter to $170 million, primarily due to the construction work on four large, gas-fired power plants progressing to the commissioning and start up stages. Gross profit decreased 47% to $20 million and gross margin percentage decreased to 11.9% from 18.3% compared to the prior year’s fourth quarter, reflecting the factors discussed above.\nThe other major factor contributing to a decreased bottom line between the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018 and the prior year’s fourth quarter was increased selling, general and administrative expenses of $3.3 million, reflecting larger operations. As a result, net income attributable to our stockholders for the three months ended January 31, 2018 decreased 66% to $7.0 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to $20.3 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, for the prior year’s fourth quarter. EBITDA attributable to our stockholders for the fourth quarter decreased 66% to $10.7 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, from $31.3 million, or $1.99 per diluted share, for the prior year’s fourth quarter.\nQuarterly Dividend:\nOn April 10, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.25 per share of common stock, payable April 30, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on April 20, 2018. This represents a change from our practice in prior years of paying dividends on an annual basis.\nCommenting on Argan’s results, Rainer Bosselmann, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Finishing the year with nearly $900 million in revenues, over $70 million in net income and a strong debt free balance sheet are major accomplishments that could not have happened without the hard work and dedication of our employees. In fact, we are happy to report that we are approaching substantial completion on four of our larger power plant projects. As we finish these major projects, we are focused on rebuilding our backlog and are cautiously optimistic that there will be several more projects to add this year. Fiscal 2019 is going to be a year where we transition into new projects and we look forward to resuming our revenue growth in the years to come.”\nAbout Argan, Inc.\nArgan’s primary business is providing a full range of services to the power industry including the engineering, procurement and construction of natural gas-fired power plants, along with related commissioning, operations management, maintenance, project development and consulting services, through its Gemma Power Systems and Atlantic Projects Company operations.

Management believes that EBITDA provides additional insight for analysts and investors in evaluating the Company’s financial and operational performance and in assisting investors in comparing the Company’s financial performance to those of other companies in the Company’s industry. However, EBITDA is not intended to be an alternative to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from the Company’s GAAP results of operations. Consistent with the requirements of SEC Regulation G, reconciliations of the Company’s non-GAAP financial results from net income are included in the presentations above and investors are advised to carefully review and consider this information as well as the GAAP financial results that are presented in the Company’s SEC filings.\nARGAN, INC.
