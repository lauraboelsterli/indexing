    "text": "Finding a lost phone is much easier if you install the right apps and make sure you're prepared before you lose the phone. \n\nCNBC will walk you through the steps that will help you find a lost phone, whether it's under the couch or was left behind at a restaurant.\nHere's what you need to do.\nIf you own an iPhone, here's how you prepare: \nOpen Settings. Tap your name at the top of the screen. Tap 'iCloud.' Scroll to 'Find My iPhone.' Enable the options for 'Find My iPhone.' Also enable the option for 'Send Last Location,' which will send the location of the iPhone right down until the battery is dead. If you lose your iPhone: \nGo to iCloud.com and log-in with your Apple account. Open 'Find iPhone' Find your iPhone on the map This will show you where your iPhone was last before the battery died, in case it was left at a restaurant. It also lets you play a sound, which will help you find the iPhone if it's stuck in a couch cushion. There are options to lock the phone and put up a message — such as a phone number to call if it's found — or erase it completely so that it can't be easily sold or used in case of theft.\nIf you own an Android phone, here's how you prepare: \nOpen the Google Play Store. Search for and download the app ' Find My Device ' from Google. Open the Find My Device application. Log in with your Google account. If you lose your Android phone: \nNavigate to https://myaccount.google.com/find-your-phone from a web browser. Log in to your Google account. Select the missing device from your list of phones. Click 'Locate' to spot the phone on a map. You can also choose to check for suspicious sign-ins, lock the phone, call your phone, sign out of your Google account remotely, contact your carrier or remotely erase the device. \nA word of note: \nIf your phone is stolen and it appears somewhere it shouldn't be, you can try to use this data when you report the stolen phone to the police. Don't try to track it down yourself if you think doing so might put you in danger.",
