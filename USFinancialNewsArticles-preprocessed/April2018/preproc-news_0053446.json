(NYSE: TCO) today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2018.\nMarch 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 Three Months Three Months Ended Ended Net income attributable to common shareowners, diluted (in thousands) $18,618 $17,215 Growth rate\n8.1%\nNet income attributable to common shareowners (EPS) per diluted common share $0.30 $0.28 Growth rate\n7.1%\nFunds from Operations (FFO) per diluted common share $0.88 $0.85 Growth rate\n3.5%\nAdjusted FFO per diluted common share $1.04 (1)\n$0.92 (2)\nGrowth rate\n13.0%\n(1) Primary exclusions to Adjusted FFO for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were the fluctuation in the fair value of the Simon Property Group (SPG) common shares investment (due to the implementation of new accounting related to investments in securities) and costs associated with shareowner activism.\n(2) Primary exclusions to Adjusted FFO for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were costs associated with shareowner activism and a restructuring charge.\n“Our strong growth was primarily driven by higher rents and greater lease cancellation income. We also benefitted from lower expenses, a result of the cost saving initiatives we implemented last year,” said Robert S. Taubman, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Taubman Centers. “Adjusted FFO per share, up 13 percent, was largely in line with our expectations.”\nOperating Statistics\nFor the quarter, total portfolio NOI was up 8.8 percent. Comparable center NOI, including lease cancellation income, was up 9.2 percent. Excluding lease cancellation income, comparable center NOI was up 4.7 percent.\n“Our centers produced very healthy NOI growth this quarter,” said Mr. Taubman. “The results of our newest comparable centers – International Market Place in Hawaii, CityOn.Xi’an in China, and Starfield Hanam in South Korea – were especially strong.”\nComparable center mall tenant sales per square foot rose 12.4 percent from the first quarter of 2017.\n“This was the best quarterly growth in our sales per square foot in six years. Nearly every center and every category of merchandise was up,” said Mr. Taubman. “We were especially pleased to see double-digit growth in apparel, a category that hasn’t grown for several years.”\nTrailing 12-month mall tenant sales per square foot increased 5 percent to $837 at March 31, 2018.\nAverage rent per square foot for the quarter was $57.73, up 3.9 percent from $55.54 in the comparable period last year.\nThe trailing 12-month releasing spread per square foot for the period ended March 31, 2018 was 4.4 percent. This spread continues to be impacted by a small number of spaces that have an average lease term of less than two-and-a-half years. Without these leases, the spread was nearly 10 percent.\nEnding occupancy in comparable centers was 92.8 percent on March 31, 2018, unchanged from March 31, 2017. Leased space in comparable centers was 95 percent on March 31, 2018, up 0.2 percent from March 31, 2017.\n“As retail continues its transition and recovery, notwithstanding elevated levels of tenant turnover during the last two years, we are pleased our portfolio occupancy and leased space remain very strong,” said Mr. Taubman. “As retailers rationalize store counts, it is evident that dominant properties, such as ours’, will outperform, gain market share, and enhance shareholder value.”\nFinancing Activity\nIn February, the company completed a $300 million, 10-year, non-recourse financing on Twelve Oaks Mall (Novi, Mich.). The loan has a fixed rate of 4.85 percent. The asset was previously unencumbered.\nIn March, the company closed on a new five-year, $250 million, unsecured term loan. The loan bears interest at a range of LIBOR plus 1.25 to 1.90 percent, based on the company’s total leverage ratio. The LIBOR rate is swapped to 1.64 percent through February 2019, resulting in an interest rate of 3.24 percent as of March 31.\nCombined proceeds from these two loans were used to pay off the company’s $475 million term loan and to pay down the company’s lines of credit.\nAgreement for the Redevelopment of Taubman Prestige Outlets Chesterfield\nDuring the quarter the company entered into a redevelopment agreement for Taubman Prestige Outlets Chesterfield (Chesterfield, Mo.). Under the terms of the agreement, The Staenberg Group (“TSG”) will lease the land subject to a long-term, participating ground lease, and the building and improvements on the property will be transferred to TSG. They are planning a significant redevelopment of the property. Taubman will receive ground lease payments and a share of the property’s revenues above a specified level. Taubman has no future capital obligation related to the redevelopment of the property.\n“This transaction will enable us to focus on our most strategic assets, where the greatest net asset value can be created,” said Mr. Taubman.\nThe agreement is subject to customary conditions and is expected to close on May 1. Management of the center will transition once the transaction is complete. Taubman Prestige Outlets Chesterfield has been excluded from the company’s comparable center guidance measures and operating statistics.\nDividend Increased\nIn March, the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.655 per share of common stock, an increase of 4.8 percent. Since the company went public in 1992 it has increased its dividend 21 times, achieving a 4.5 percent compounded annual growth rate over the period. See Taubman Centers Increases Quarterly Common Dividend 4.8 Percent to $0.655 Per Share – March 2, 2018.\n2018 Guidance\nThe company is updating certain guidance measures for 2018. 2018 EPS is now expected to be in the range of $0.99 to $1.23 per diluted common share, revised from the previous range of $1.15 to $1.39.\n2018 Adjusted FFO, which excludes $0.16 per diluted common share of first quarter adjustments, remains unchanged and is expected to be in the range of $3.72 to $3.86 per diluted common share.\n2018 FFO, which includes the $0.16 per diluted common share of first quarter adjustments, is now expected to be in the range of $3.56 to $3.70 per diluted common share, revised from the previous range of $3.72 to $3.86.\nThe company continues to expect comparable center NOI growth of 2 to 3 percent for the year.\nThis guidance now assumes the company’s beneficial share of lease cancellation income to be about $16 million, up from the previous estimate of about $14 million. This guidance does not include assumptions for future costs associated with shareowner activism or fluctuations in the fair value of the SPG common shares investment.\nSupplemental Investor Information Available\nThe company provides supplemental investor information along with its earnings announcements, available online at www.taubman.com under “Investors.” This includes the following:\nEarnings Press Release Company Overview Operational Statistics Summary of Key Guidance Measures Income Statements Changes in Funds from Operations and Earnings Per Common Share Balance Sheets Debt Summary Capital Spending and Balance Sheet Information Owned Centers Redevelopments Anchors & Major Tenants in Owned Portfolio Components of Other Income, Other Operating Expense, and Nonoperating Income (Expense) Earnings Reconciliations Operating Statistics Glossary\nInvestor Conference Call\nThe company will host a conference call at 10:00 a.m. EDT on Friday, April 27 to discuss these results, business conditions and the company’s outlook for the remainder of 2018.

(2) During the three months ended March 31, 2018, an expense of $10.3 million was incurred for the fluctuation in the fair value of the SPG common shares investment. In connection with the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01 on January 1, 2018, the Company now measures its investment in SPG common shares at fair value with changes in value recorded through net income. (3) During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the joint venture that owns the Valencia Place office tower at Country Club Plaza recognized a $4.4 million gain ($2.8 million at TRG's share) and $0.7 million ($0.7 million at TRG's share) of income tax expense in connection with the sale of the office tower. TAUBMAN CENTERS, INC.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company uses certain non-GAAP operating measures, including EBITDA, beneficial interest in EBITDA, Net Operating Income, and Funds from Operations. These measures are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures. Additional information as to the use of these measures are as follows.\nEBITDA represents earnings before interest, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization of the Operating Partnership's consolidated and unconsolidated businesses. Beneficial interest in EBITDA represents the Operating Partnership’s share of the earnings before interest, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization of its consolidated and unconsolidated businesses. The Company believes EBITDA and beneficial interest in EBITDA provide useful indicators of operating performance, as it is customary in the real estate and shopping center business to evaluate the performance of properties on a basis unaffected by capital structure.\nThe Company uses Net Operating Income (NOI) as an alternative measure to evaluate the operating performance of centers, both on individual and stabilized portfolio bases, and in formulating corporate goals and compensation. The Company defines NOI as property-level operating revenues (includes rental income excluding straight-line adjustments of minimum rent) less maintenance, taxes, utilities, promotion, ground rent (including straight-line adjustments), and other property operating expenses. Since NOI excludes expenses, pre-development charges, interest income and expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, restructuring charges, and gains from peripheral land and property dispositions, it provides a performance measure that, when compared period over period, reflects the revenues and expenses most directly associated with owning and operating rental properties, as well as the impact on their operations from trends in tenant sales, occupancy and rental rates, and operating costs. The Company also uses NOI excluding lease cancellation income as an alternative measure because this income may vary significantly from period to period, which can affect comparability and trend analysis. The Company generally provides separate projections for expected comparable center NOI growth and lease cancellation income. Comparable centers are generally defined as centers that were owned and open for the entire current and preceding period presented, excluding centers impacted by significant redevelopment activity. In addition, The Mall of San Juan has been excluded from “comparable center” statistics as a result of Hurricane Maria and the expectation that the center’s performance will be impacted for the foreseeable future. Finally, Taubman Prestige Outlets Chesterfield has also been excluded from comparable center statistics as a result of the expected redevelopment of the center by The Staenberg Group.\nThe National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) defines Funds from Operations (FFO) as net income (computed in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)), excluding gains (or losses) from extraordinary items and sales of properties and impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate, plus real estate related depreciation and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The Company believes that FFO is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, the Company and most industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results that exclude historical cost depreciation to be useful in evaluating the operating performance of REITs. The Company primarily uses FFO in measuring performance and in formulating corporate goals and compensation.\nThe Company may also present adjusted versions of NOI, beneficial interest in EBITDA, and FFO when used by management to evaluate operating performance when certain significant items have impacted results that affect comparability with prior or future periods due to the nature or amounts of these items. The Company believes the disclosure of the adjusted items is similarly useful to investors and others to understand management's view on comparability of such measures between periods. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, FFO and EBITDA were adjusted to exclude a reduction of a previously expensed restructuring charge, costs incurred associated with shareowner activism, and the fluctuation in the fair value of the SPG common shares investments. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, FFO was also adjusted for a charge recognized in connection with the write-off of deferred financing costs related to the early payoff of the Company's $475 million unsecured term loan. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, FFO and EBITDA were adjusted to exclude a restructuring charge and costs incurred associated with shareowner activism. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, FFO was also adjusted for a charge recognized in connection with the partial write-off of deferred financing costs related to an amendment of the Company's primary unsecured revolving line of credit in February 2017. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, EBITDA was also adjusted to exclude a gain recognized in connection with the sale of the Valencia Place office tower at Country Club Plaza.\nThese non-GAAP measures as presented by the Company are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other REITs due to the fact that not all REITs use the same definitions. These measures should not be considered alternatives to net income or as an indicator of the Company's operating performance. Additionally, these measures do not represent cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities as defined by GAAP.\nThe Company provides its beneficial interest in certain financial information of its Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. This beneficial information is derived as the Company’s ownership interest in the investee multiplied by the specific financial statement item being presented. Investors are cautioned that deriving the Company’s beneficial interest in this manner may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of holding a non-controlling interest in the investee.\nTAUBMAN CENTERS, INC.
