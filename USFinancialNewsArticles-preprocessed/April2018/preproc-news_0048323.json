    "text": "JERUSALEM, April 22 (Reuters) - An Israeli court on Sunday ordered the liquidation of debt-laden holding company Eurocom, whose assets include a controlling stake in the country’s largest telecom group, Bezeq.\nThe decision came after Eurocom, which owes about 1.3 billion shekels ($370 million) in debt, could not find a buyer or reach a restructuring agreement with lenders.\nFollowing the court’s decision, Eurocom declined to comment.\nEurocom is owned by Shaul Elovitch, who faces criminal charges for fraud and other securities offences.\nThe liquidation order came after a number of banks petitioned the court and will take effect on May 3, according to an official court document.\nEurocom also controls satellite operator Spacecom.\n$1 = 3.5269 shekels Reporting by Ari Rabinovitch Additional reporting by Steven Scheer Editing by Tova Cohen\n ",
