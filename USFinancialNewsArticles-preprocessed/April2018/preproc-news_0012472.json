    "text": "April 7, 2018 / 2:05 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Bale 'not in good mood' after being benched at Juve - Zidane Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \nMADRID (Reuters) - Gareth Bale appears more isolated than ever at Real Madrid after not playing in his side’s 3-0 win over Juventus in the Champions League and barely celebrating his side’s goals, but coach Zinedine Zidane said he understood the player’s frustration. Soccer Football - La Liga Santander - Las Palmas vs Real Madrid - Gran Canaria Stadium, Las Palmas, Spain - March 31, 2018 Real Madrid's Gareth Bale during the warm up before the match REUTERS/Santiago Ferrero/File Photo \nThe Wales forward is Madrid’s second-top scorer behind Cristiano Ronaldo this season but has become dispensable in the biggest games, with Zidane starting without him in both of their Champions League last-16 games with Paris St Germain before leaving him on the bench in the quarter-final first leg at Juve. \n“I understand that he is not in a good mood, that’s normal,” Zidane told a news conference on Saturday, ahead of Real’s La Liga game against city rivals Atletico Madrid on Sunday. \n“Players want to play in every game. We know what a good player he is and what he has done. I have to take decisions but if he doesn’t play two games it doesn’t mean anything. I still think he’s an important player.” \nWhile his fellow substitutes wildly celebrated Ronaldo’s outrageous bicycle kick goal against Juventus, Bale barely reacted. \nHe also did not stay on the pitch with the rest of his team mates to salute their fans after coming on as a substitute in their 3-1 win at home to PSG in February, which was interpreted in the Spanish media as a sign of his anger at not starting against the French side. \nThe Wales forward had a dream first campaign at Real following a then world-record 85.5-million-pound move from Tottenham Hotspur in 2013, scoring in the Champions League and King’s Cup final victories over Atletico Madrid.

It’s my job to try and make sure he plays as well as always. He’s an important player but others played against Juventus and did very well. That’s football.” Reporting by Richard Martin; Editing by Clare Fallon",
