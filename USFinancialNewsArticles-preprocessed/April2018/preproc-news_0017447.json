More truckers are piling into the growing business of delivering bulky goods to consumers’ homes, drawn by booming online furniture sales and the chance to get more of their retail customers’ shipments. Ryder System Inc. R 0.25% is the latest to jump into the business, Logistics Report’s Jennifer Smith writes, with its $120 million purchase of MXD Group, a logistics firm that specializes in home delivery of big items. The work imposes higher service demands on carriers that may be more accustomed to hauling truckloads of goods to warehouses than hiring drivers for “white glove” installation service in hard-to-access residential streets. And although the sector is growing, with the market expected to hit $12 billion over the next decade, it’s a small fraction of the overall $676 billion trucking market.\nThe bill to repair U.S. roadways is coming due, as lean state budgets and heavy traffic take their toll on highways. Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant is closing more than 100 bridges there this week, citing “extreme peril to the safety of persons and property,” WSJ’s Cameron McWhirter writes. Many of the spans are in rural areas where the cost of repairing them could overwhelm the local tax base. The problem is nationwide, with nearly 9% of U.S. bridges deemed “structurally deficient” by the federal government. That’s triggering big legislative fights over transportation funding and taxes in many states. Some Texas counties say their local roads are being battered by heavily laden trucks serving nearby oil and gas fields, the Texas Tribune reports , and want drilling revenue to help pay for repairs. With President Donald Trump’s $200 billion infrastructure plan getting little traction in Congress, there’s not much help coming from Washington.\nThe brewing U.S.-China trade war is compounding problems for companies that peddle used paper, milk jugs and metal. China is the top customer for the vast quantities of recyclable waste generated by the U.S., but the WSJ’s Bob Tita reports a 25% tariff on U.S. scrap aluminum and other recent Chinese restrictions on imported waste are sending the recycling industry into a tailspin . U.S exports of scrap plastic to China dropped 80% from October to January, and prices for mixed aluminum scrap dropped by about 15% over the past month, crumbling profit margins for processors and brokers that sell the material to China. Analysts say Chinese companies may end up buying more scrap aluminum from cheaper sources in Europe. In the U.S., some worry that trash collectors may simply toss recyclables in landfills if they can’t find other buyers.\nCOMMODITIES A Wayfair Inc. furniture photo studio. Photo: Bloomberg News The oil glut that’s filled storage sites and tankers with crude has dissipated. Excess inventories of stored oil have plummeted nearly 90% over the past two years as big producers have throttled back output while instability has hampered crude production in places like Venezuela, WSJ’s Benoit Faucon, Summer Said and Anant Vijay Kala write. The global thirst for oil is higher than was previously forecast, as synchronized economic expansion stokes demand. That has prices in some markets pushing hitting $70 a barrel, a level not seen in three years. Still, while Saudi Arabia is tightening output, North American shale producers are pushing more crude to world markets. And as global oil supply and demand come back into balance after years of excessively high inventory, analysts say geopolitical factors like U.S.-Russian tensions over Syria could come bubbling back up in the oil fields.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ Home delivery is more finicky, more risky and more costly. ’\n—Paul Thompson, chairman of Transportation Insight LLC.\nNumber of the Day 20.2% Year-over-year increase in truck trailers moving in intermodal rail networks in March, according to the Association of American Railroads.\nIN OTHER NEWS President Donald Trump asked his economic advisers to study re-entering Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations more than a year after he withdrew the U.S. from the trade pact .
