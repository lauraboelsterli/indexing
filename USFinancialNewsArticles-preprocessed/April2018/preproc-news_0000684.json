    "text": "TAMPA, Fla., April 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ConnectWise announced today that Arlin Sorensen, vice president of HTG Peer Groups for ConnectWise , has joined the Channel Advisory Board at CompTIA , the world’s leading technology association.\nArlin Sorensen, vice president of HTG Peer Groups for ConnectWise, has joined the Channel Advisory Board at CompTIA.\nSorensen brings to the board more than three decades of experience in the IT world, first as founder of a managed service provider company that served more than 500 businesses globally, and more recently, as the founder of HGT Peer Groups , an international peer group organization that cultivates the success of others by igniting transformation. Today, as vice president of HTG Peer Groups at ConnectWise, Sorensen continues to oversee the best-in-class business maturity and leadership coaching program. ConnectWise acquired HTG in early January.\n“With the breadth of his experience in our industry, Arlin is a strong addition to our Channel Advisory Board,” said Annette Taber, CompTIA’s vice president for industry outreach. “His insights into the business of technology – how it is developed, marketed, purchased and deployed – will help guide the actions we take as an advisory council, an association and an industry.”\nSorensen said he is looking forward to serving on the CompTIA Channel Advisory Board where he can leverage his 30 plus years of IT channel experience and give back to the industry. “I’ve had the privilege of watching this channel grow from the early days into the vibrant place it is today, and I look forward to being part of a group that is focused on dealing with the challenges related to the ongoing transformation of technology and how the channel can mature to remain viable,” he said.\nThe CompTIA Channel Advisory Board includes executives from technology hardware manufacturers, software publishers, carriers, service companies, distributors, master agents and technology solution provider companies. This group provides counsel and insight to help technology solution providers adapt to the changing marketplace. This includes helping them to build out their “business solutions” practices using cloud-based options and other emerging technologies to help customers with their digital transformations.\nA native of Harlan, Iowa, Sorensen led Heartland Technology Solutions for 27 years as an IT solution provider that grew to over 100 employees in five states and Heartland Tech group for 17 years that grew to serve more than 500 managed service providers globally. Sorensen continues to lead HTS Ag, a precision agriculture company founded in 1995. As a serial entrepreneur, he continues to learn and drives businesses that leverage technology to improve the world we live in.\nAbout ConnectWise\nConnectWise transforms how technology solution providers successfully build, manage and grow their businesses.
