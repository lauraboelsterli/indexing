This series focuses on the specific elements of asset liability management, ethics, fair lending, regulations, and educational needs that financial services leaders must understand and adhere to in order to be successfully lead their organization.\nBAI first introduced its role-based courseware in December with Frontline, Sales and Service, Mortgage Loan Origination and Consumer Lending as the initial specialized course offerings. The self-paced courses give participants a better understanding of how certain regulations pertain to and may impact their role or the organization. Each course, which is 10- to 15-minutes in length, is designed to complement traditional educational and development training. Initial studies indicate that role-based courses can save users up to 30 percent in training time.\n“We believe that a strong culture of compliance and responsibility starts at the top, which is why it is vital for an organization’s executive leaders and board of directors to have access to compliance training that is comprehensive, relevant and efficient,” said Karl Dahlgren, managing director for BAI. “These individuals need the clarity and confidence to make smarter business decisions for their organizations in an ever-changing regulatory environment.”\nThe role-based curriculums are incorporated into BAI’s compliance and professional development courseware catalogs for banks, credit unions, mortgage companies and nonbanks and are available to new and existing customers. BAI will continue to add new roles to the curriculum throughout the year.\nFor more information, visit www.bai.org/training .\nAbout BAI\nAs a nonprofit, independent organization, BAI delivers the financial services industry’s most actionable insights, enabling leaders to make smart business decisions every day.
