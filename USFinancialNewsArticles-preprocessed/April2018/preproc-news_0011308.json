    "text": "CJ Miles and OG Anunoby combined to hit 10 of Toronto’s 17 3-pointers, and the Raptors beat the Orlando Magic 112-101 on Sunday in their final home game of the regular season at Air Canada Centre.\nMiles finished with 22 points, and Anunoby tied his season-high with 21 points for Toronto, which has won three in a row. Miles and Anunoby each hit five 3-pointers.\nThe Raptors went 34-7 at Air Canada Centre this regular season, and they’ll be back home in the playoffs. Toronto has clinched the No. 1 seed and home-court advantage throughout the Eastern Conference playoffs for the first time in franchise history. With two games remaining, the Raptors (58-22) stretched their franchise record for wins, putting more distance on the 56 they won in 2015-16.\nThe Raptors took a 61-50 lead into halftime behind 14 points from Miles. Toronto hit 10 of its 3-pointers in the first half.\nOrlando chipped into the Raptors’ lead in the third quarter. Aaron Gordon hit a pair of 3-pointers, the second trimming the deficit to 74-70 with 4:22 left in the quarter. Gordon finished with 16 points to lead the Magic (24-56).\nToronto answered the challenge, closing out the third quarter with a 15-4 run to take an 89-74 lead into the fourth quarter. Miles and Anunoby hit 3-pointers during the spurt.\nThe Magic ended Sunday a half-game ahead of the last-place Atlanta Hawks in the Eastern Conference. In the Western Conference, only the Dallas Mavericks, Memphis Grizzlies and Phoenix Suns have worse records than the Magic.\nThe Raptors will be waiting to find out their first-round opponent during the final week. The Washington Wizards, Milwaukee Bucks and Miami Heat are each possibilities.\nToronto leading-scorer DeMar DeRozan was held out of Sunday’s game for rest.\nToronto will close out the regular season on the road, starting Monday at Detroit. The Raptors are at Miami on Wednesday.\nOrlando is at Milwaukee on Monday, before returning home to finish the season against the Washington Wizards on Wednesday.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
