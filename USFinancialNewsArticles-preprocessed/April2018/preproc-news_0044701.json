    "text": "SEOUL, April 20 (Reuters) - General Motorsâ€™ South Korean unit and its labour union plan to continue talks until 5 p.m. Seoul time on Monday, a union official said in a text message, amid the move by the U.S. automaker to seek bankruptcy for the loss-making unit.\nGM Korea and its labour union failed to reach a wage deal by the Friday deadline. GM Korea had said it would likely file for court receivership if the deadline passes without a deal.\nThe two sides plan to hold another round of talks on Saturday, the union official said.
