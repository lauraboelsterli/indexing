Soccer Football - Premier League - Burnley vs Leicester City - Turf Moor, Burnley, Britain - April 14, 2018 Leicester City's Kasper Schmeichel on the bench after being substituted off due to injury REUTERS/Russell Cheyne \nJapan international Okazaki was substituted with an ankle problem at half-time in the 2-1 defeat at Turf Moor while Schmeichel was withdrawn in the closing minutes after a collision with Burnley striker Ashley Barnes. \n“It was a fall and a knock (for Schmeichel),” Puel said. “The problem is in his ankle and we will see if he can play in this game. Okazaki, also, we will see if can come back with his ankle too.

We need to adapt to the situation, of course, like we have done already.” \nPuel also said that midfielder Daniel Amartey, who is on the mend from a hamstring injury, had returned to training but the Ghana international will not be ready to face relegation-threatened Southampton.
