    "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinaâ€™s Ministry of Commerce said on Tuesday its anti-dumping investigation on the imports of U.S. sorghum aims to correct unfair trade practices.\nChina is willing to expand cooperation with the United States on trade disputes, the ministry added in a statement.\nThe ministry said earlier China will require agricultural business CHS Inc and other U.S. companies to put down a deposit of 178.6 percent of the value of their sorghum exports to China, effective from Wednesday, after finding the U.S. grain has damaged the domestic industry.\nReporting by Beijing Monitoring Desk; Editing by Christian Schmollinger\n ",
