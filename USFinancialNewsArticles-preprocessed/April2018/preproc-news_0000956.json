    "text": "April 3, 2018 / 6:12 AM / Updated 43 minutes ago Cricket-Defiant New Zealand hold on for draw to win England series Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nCHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand, April 3 (Reuters) - Tail-ender Ish Sodhi hit a gutsy half century as New Zealand fought a defiant rearguard action on a tense final day to hold on for a draw in the second test on Tuesday and secure a first series win over England since 1999. \nWinners of the first test in Auckland by an innings and 49 runs, New Zealand were 256 for eight when the umpires offered Sodhi the light, still 126 runs in arrears but with the all-important draw secure. \nEngland made the perfect start to the final day when Stuart Broad claimed wickets with the first two deliveries but the tourists, looking for a first overseas test win in 13 outings, were unable to winkle out the final few batsmen. \nOpener Tom Latham scored 83 but it was spinner Sodhi’s 168-ball 56 not out that most frustrated England, who scored 307 in their first innings and 352-9 declared in the second after New Zealand’s 278.
