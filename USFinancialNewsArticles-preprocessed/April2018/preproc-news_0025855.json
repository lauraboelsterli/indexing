These moves have positioned Nebraska Book Company for success under the direction of Mr. Amond.\n“With Rick’s stewardship we made great progress in creating the new Nebraska Book Company and have an excellent strategic plan for moving our organization forward,” said Mr. Amond. “I fully intend to build on the foundation that he and our entire team created and that our great customers deserve.”\nAbout Nebraska Book Company, Inc.\nNebraska Book Company, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nebraska Book Holdings Inc., began in 1915 as an independent college bookstore and is now a leading source of software, textbooks, rental program options, and digital content delivery to over 2,000 independent college retailers nationwide.
