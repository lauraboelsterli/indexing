    "text": "PANAMA CITY, April 5 (Reuters) - The government of Panama said on Thursday that it would remove its ambassador from Venezuela and asked the crisis-stricken OPEC country to withdraw its ambassador from Panama as well, reflecting the escalating tensions between the countries.\nIn a statement issued on Thursday evening, Panama said the move was a response to Venezuela’s decision to halt commercial relations with a host of Panamanian officials and companies, including airline Copa and President Juan Carlos Varela, for alleged involvement in money laundering.\nLast month, Panama included Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on a list of Venezuelan nationals who are considered “high risk” for money laundering.\nReporting by Elida Moreno; writing by Julia Love\n ",
