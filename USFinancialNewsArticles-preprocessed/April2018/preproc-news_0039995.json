    "text": "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- OFG Bancorp (NYSE:OFG) today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, reflecting continued strong recovery following hurricanes Irma and Maria, which struck the island in September 2017.\n1Q18 Summary\nNet income available to shareholders was $13.5 million, or $0.29 per fully diluted share. This was in line with 4Q17’s $13.6 million, or $0.30 per share, and exceeded the year ago quarter’s $11.7 million, or $0.26 per share. Return on average assets and average tangible common equity was 1.09% and 7.73%, respectively. Tangible book value per common share was $15.71, and tangible common equity ratio was 11.22%. Loan production of $309.4 million increased 22.0% from 4Q17 and 41.4% from the year ago quarter. Total provision for loan and lease losses, net, declined 37.9% from 4Q17, which included $5.4 million in additional hurricanes-related provision. Core non-interest income of $18.2 million increased 9.0% from 4Q17 and 4.7% from the year ago quarter as banking service fees and mortgage banking revenues rebounded.\nCEO Comment\nJosé Rafael Fernández, President, Chief Executive Officer, and Vice Chairman of the Board, commented:\n“Our first quarter results reflect the success of our strategies and Puerto Rico’s emerging recovery. We earned $0.29 per share fully diluted, 12% higher than a year ago. Our strong capital position continued to build.\n“The island benefited from loan payment moratoriums by Oriental and other banks, an increased availability of electric power, improvement in communications, and the return of day to day stability, as well as rebuild spending by FEMA, the start of payments of insurance claims, and the prospect of growing assignments of federal funds.\n“Nearly every metric in 1Q18 confirmed this progress. For the second quarter in a row, our originated loan growth outpaced the pay down of acquired loans, resulting in a net increase of $77.1 million from December 31, 2017—close to 8% on an annualized basis.\n“Auto, consumer and mortgage lending at $192.3 million increased 52% from 4Q17 and more than 11% from 1Q17. In particular, auto lending was at a record level, up more than 46% from the preceding and year ago quarters.\n“Commercial loan production in Puerto Rico, while lower than 4Q17, rose more than 13% year over year. Meanwhile, our U.S. commercial and industrial loan program added $74 million in participations.\n“With nearly all of our loan moratoriums expiring, 1Q18 credit quality remained stable. Most metrics were better than, or returned to, pre-hurricanes levels.\n“Fee revenues rebounded with a 24% sequential increase in Banking Services and a 43% increase in Mortgage Banking. Core Wealth Management held steady at pre-hurricanes levels.\n“Customer deposits (excluding brokered) increased 2% from the end of 2017 and 5% from a year ago. Our Net Interest Margin expanded to 5.22%, and net new customer accounts grew at an annualized rate of 8%, significantly exceeding 2017’s hurricanes affected 2% rise.\n“Our effort to differentiate Oriental through superior service and digital banking technology is proving effective. Our team of dedicated bankers continually reaching out to our customers and clients is clearly working. And during 1Q18, we introduced another new technology-based service—My Payments (Mis Pagos), which enables loan-only customers to pay online instead of standing in line.\n“While we remain cautious due to the uncertain economic environment on the island, we are confident positive momentum will prevail for both OFG and Puerto Rico. We will continue to sharpen our focus on our retail and commercial clients, improve our service levels, and provide faster and more agile ways to do banking.”\nIncome Statement Highlights\nUnless otherwise noted, the following compares data for the first quarter 2018 to the fourth quarter 2017.\nInterest Income Originated Loans: Increased $0.6 million to $56.8 million, primarily due to higher balances. Acquired Loans: Declined $1.1 million to $17.8 million, reflecting continued pay downs. Investment Securities: Increased $0.5 million to $8.6 million, the result of higher balances and higher yield. Interest Expense: Declined $0.5 million to $9.2 million, primarily due to reduced cost of deposits. Total Provision for Loan and Lease Losses: Declined $9.4 million to $15.5 million. 1Q18 provision included $8.6 million to replenish the allowance for retail loan charge-offs of $8.2 million related to the hurricanes. 1Q18 provision also included an increase in the allowance related to auto loan portfolio growth and one commercial loan placed in non-accrual. Net Interest Margin: Increased 14 basis points to 5.22% mainly due to higher yield in the investment portfolio and cash balances. Total Banking and Wealth Management Revenues: Increased $1.5 million to $18.2 million. Banking Service Revenues rose $2.0 million, largely the result of increased electronic banking activity with more power coming back on the island. Mortgage Banking Activities were up $0.5 million, primarily due to increased business. Wealth Management Revenues fell $1.0 million, reflecting the absence of annual insurance fees recognized in 4Q17. Total Non-Interest Expenses: Increased $5.5 million to $52.1 million. 4Q17 included $3.8 million in items that temporarily lowered costs, including reduced expenses related to electronic banking activity. 1Q18 reflected higher seasonal compensation expenses and expenses related to the sale of foreclosed assets returning to pre-hurricanes levels. Effective Tax Rate (ETR): Approximately 32%, the rate the Company is currently estimating for the full year.\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nUnless otherwise noted, the following compares data at March 31, 2018 to December 31, 2017.\nTotal Loans Net: Increased $77.1 million to $4.13 billion with originated loan growth more than offsetting normal pay downs of acquired loans. Production highlights include: Auto lending at a record $128.1 million was up 46.3% from 4Q17 and 47.6% year over year, reflecting replacement of damaged vehicles, pent up demand, and the market’s effort to adjust to one less auto lending competitor. Consumer lending increased 62.6% to $37.5 million, exceeding pre-hurricanes levels, as retail customers moved to replace needed items and repair homes. Mortgage lending rebounded 67.7% to $26.6 million from 4Q17’s low, post-hurricanes level, but was down 38.7% from the year ago quarter. Commercial lending at $42.8 million declined from 4Q17’s robust levels, but was up 13.5% from 1Q17. The Company’s bankers continue building relationships with businesses participating in Puerto Rico’s recovery. The recently established OFG USA program added $74.4 million in commercial and industrial related loan participations across an array of industries and geographies in the continental U.S. Cash and cash equivalents: Declined $122.8 million to $365.4 million as cash was used to fund new loan growth and reduce higher cost borrowings. Total Investments: Increased $132.5 million to $1.30 billion with the purchase of new mortgage backed securities to take advantage of favorable market opportunities. Customer Deposits (excluding brokered deposits): Increased $77.9 million to $4.36 billion, up 1.8% and 5.2% from December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively. Growth in demand and savings accounts more than offset a decline in time deposits. Total Borrowings: Increased $25.6 million to $354.3 million as OFG used repurchase agreement funding to acquire investment securities. The Company also paid down higher cost FHLB advances. Total Stockholders’ Equity: Increased $1.7 million to $946.8 million, with increases in retained earnings and legal surplus more than offsetting the increase of accumulated other comprehensive loss due to the effect of higher prevailing market interest rates.\nCredit Quality Highlights\nUnless otherwise noted, the following compares data on the originated loan portfolio at March 31, 2018 to December 31, 2017.\nFollowing hurricanes Irma and Maria, Oriental offered automatic payment deferrals and 90-day extensions for most loan categories. Most of these payment moratoriums ended in 1Q18 with most credit metrics better than, or returned to, pre-hurricanes levels.\nNet Charge-Off Rate: Remained virtually level at 1.34%. Consumer loan charge-offs returned to pre-hurricanes levels, while other loan categories remained flat or declined. Early Delinquency Rate: Increased 138 basis points to 3.20% and Total Delinquency Rate rose 164 basis points to 6.25% as both metrics returned to pre-hurricanes levels. Non-Performing Loan Rate: Increased 51 basis points to 3.82%. The commercial loan rate increased 79 bps due to a $10.5 million loan that is current in its monthly payments, but was placed in non-accrual due to credit deterioration. The auto loan rate increased 94 bps due to 1Q18 moratorium expirations. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses: Increased $4.1 million to $96.8 million, due to higher loan balances, particularly in auto lending, and the above mentioned commercial loan placed in non-accrual status.\nCapital Position\nUnless otherwise noted, the following compares data at March 31, 2018 to December 31, 2017.\nCapital continued to grow and remains significantly above regulatory requirements for a well-capitalized institution.\nMetric\n1Q18\nQoQ Change\nYoY Change\nTangible Common Equity Ratio\n11.22% -7 bps +56 bps Tangible Book Value per Common Share\n$15.71 +0.3% +2.5% Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio (using Basel III methodology)\n14.62% +3 bps +32 bps Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio\n20.31% -3 bps +26 bps Conference Call\nA conference call to discuss OFG’s results for 1Q18, outlook and related matters will be held today, Friday, April 20, 2018, at 10:00 AM Eastern Time.
