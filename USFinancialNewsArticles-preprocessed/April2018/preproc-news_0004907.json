    "text": "WASHINGTON, April 3 (Reuters) - The top legal officers from 11 states and Washington D.C. on Tuesday promised to defend federal automobile efficiency standards against a rollback proposed by the Trump administration this week.\n\"All Americans ... deserve to enjoy fuel-efficient, low-emission cars and light trucks that save money on gas, improve our health and support American jobs,\" according to a statement about the administration's proposed rollback of the standards on Monday. The statement was also signed by more than 50 mayors from around the United States.\nThe attorneys general signing the statement are from states including New York, Iowa and Massachusetts.
