    "text": "ELKHART, Ind., April 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Patrick Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: PATK), a major manufacturer and distributor of component and building products for the recreational vehicle (\"RV\"), manufactured housing (\"MH\"), marine and industrial markets, today reported its financial results for the first quarter ended April 1, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nNet sales for the first quarter of 2018 increased $206.4 million or 60%, to $551.8 million from $345.4 million in the same quarter of 2017. The increase was attributable to industry growth, acquisitions, geographic expansion efforts, and market share gains. The Company's revenues from the RV industry, which represented 69% of first quarter 2018 sales, increased 53% as industry wholesale unit shipments increased approximately 13% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year. Revenues from the marine industry represented 8% of the Company's first quarter 2018 sales and more than tripled over the first quarter of 2017. Revenues from the MH industry, which represented 11% of first quarter 2018 sales, increased 43% compared to the prior year period with an estimated increase in MH wholesale unit shipments of approximately 10% from the first quarter of 2017. Revenues from the industrial market, which is tied primarily to residential housing, commercial construction, and institutional furniture spending, increased 64%. The industrial market, which accounted for 12% of the Company's first quarter 2018 sales, saw new housing starts increase approximately 8% in the quarter.\nThe Company's RV content per unit (on a trailing twelve-month basis) for the first quarter of 2018 increased approximately 17% to $2,414 from $2,063 for the first quarter of 2017. MH content per unit (on a trailing twelve-month basis) for the first quarter of 2018 increased approximately 18% to an estimated $2,375 from $2,015 for the first quarter of 2017.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, Patrick reported operating income of $41.8 million, an increase of 75% or $17.9 million, from $23.9 million reported in the first quarter of 2017. Net income in the first quarter of 2018 increased 72% to $30.1 million from $17.5 million in the first quarter of 2017, and net income per diluted share increased 60% to $1.20 from $0.75.\nTodd Cleveland, Chief Executive Officer, said, \"Our first quarter results reflect the continued execution and traction of our strategic and operational initiatives, coupled with the ongoing momentum in our primary markets. The investments we have made in production efficiency improvements, targeted geographic and product expansions, employee talent and retention initiatives, and strategic acquisitions in our core markets, are all generating the expected returns based on our model. During the first quarter, we completed four acquisitions - Metal Moulding and Aluminum Metals in February 2018, and Indiana Marine Products and Collins & Company in March 2018.\"\n\"Both our leisure family lifestyle markets and our housing and industrial markets are fundamentally strong with early indicators and demographic drivers pointing towards continued growth,\" stated Andy Nemeth, President. \"Based on the most recently available data, RV and marine retail sales and new housing formations are off to a solid start for the year, and match up well with recent historical seasonal trends and demand patterns. Attendance levels and excitement generated at the early spring industry retail and trade shows support our optimism about the sustainable long-term potential in our key markets, and we are committed to putting capital to work in alignment with our disciplined capital allocation strategy to drive improved performance and shareholder value while continuing to position ourselves to be able to fully support our customers.\"\nAs part of its allocation strategy, the Company invested $117.0 million in the aggregate in the first quarter of 2018 for acquisitions, stock repurchases, and capital expenditures. In addition, as previously announced in January 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program that authorized the purchase of up to $50 million of the Company's common stock over a 24-month period. Year-to-date through April 24, 2018, the Company repurchased 720,695 shares at an average price of $57.56 per share for a total cost of $41.5 million.\n\"In anticipation of continued growth in 2018 and beyond in all four of our end markets, we are optimistic about the opportunities to drive our business and execute on our strategic growth plan, gain market share, expand operations in targeted regional territories, and drive shareholder value,\" Mr. Cleveland further stated. \"We expect to continue to make targeted capital investments to support our new business initiatives and maintain our balanced approach to leveraging our operating platform, introduce new products and product line extensions, and execute on our organic and acquisition-related objectives.\"\nConference Call Webcast\nAs previously announced, Patrick Industries will host an online webcast of its first quarter 2018 earnings conference call that can be accessed on the Company's website, www.patrickind.com , under \"Investor Relations,\" on Thursday, April 26, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time.\nPatrick Industries, Inc.\nPatrick Industries, Inc. is a major manufacturer of component products and distributor of building products serving the recreational vehicle, manufactured housing, marine, kitchen cabinet, office and household furniture, fixtures and commercial furnishings, and other industrial markets and operates coast-to-coast through locations in 20 states and in China.
