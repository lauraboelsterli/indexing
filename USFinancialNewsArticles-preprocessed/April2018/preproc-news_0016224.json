FILE PHOTO: Logo of Saudi Aramco is seen at the 20th Middle East Oil & Gas Show and Conference (MOES 2017) in Manama, Bahrain, March 7, 2017. REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed/File Photo \nAramco is scheduled on Saturday to sign agreements in Houston with Honeywell UOP ( HON.N ) to study an aromatics unit and with Technip FMC ( FTI.N ) for a unit to produce polymers from ethane, the sources said. \nThe aromatics unit Honeywell UOP is studying would convert benzene and paraxylene, byproducts of gasoline production, into 2 million tons annually of feedstocks for chemicals and plastics, according to the sources. \nThe unit Technip FMC is studying would convert ethane into 2 million tons a year of ethylene, which is used to make plastics, the sources said. \nThe agreements with the two companies include technology licenses for proprietary systems they produce, the sources said.
