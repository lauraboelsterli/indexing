It produced 123,000 tonnes of metal last year or 3 percent of the total.\nThe U.S. Treasury Department on April 6 imposed sanctions on seven Russian oligarchs and 12 firms they own or control, saying they were profiting from a Russian state engaged in “malign activities” around the world.\nThis includes Rusal, the world’s largest aluminium producer after China Hongqiao Group.\nRusal is heavily dependent on its international network of mines and refineries. Last year these accounted for 53 percent of its output of raw material ore bauxite and 64 percent of production of semi-processed sister alumina.\nThe company may be forced to divest most of its portfolio of overseas operations if the aluminium giant cannot restructure them to evade U.S. sanctions and ensure a flow of raw materials.\nMining Group Rio Tinto said last week it would declare force majeure on certain customer contracts after the U.S. imposed sanctions on its partner Rusal.\nReporting by Pratima Desai; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ",
