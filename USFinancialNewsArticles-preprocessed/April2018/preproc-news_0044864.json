    "text": "April 22, 2018 / 5:20 PM / Updated 26 minutes ago Fresenius pulls out of Akorn takeover over data integrity Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nBERLIN (Reuters) - German healthcare group Fresenius SE ( FREG.DE ) said it had decided to pull out of its planned acquisition of Akorn ( AKRX.O ) after it found data integrity breaches at the U.S. generic drug maker. \nFresenius agreed last year to buy the U.S. maker of liquid generic drugs for about $4.75 billion, but said in February it could terminate the deal if its own independent probe found Akorn breached U.S. Food and Drug Administration data integrity requirements related to product development. \nThe German company said on Sunday its investigation had found “material breaches” of FDA data integrity requirements relating to Akorn’s operations. \n“Fresenius offered to delay its decision in order to allow Akorn additional opportunity to complete its own investigation and present any information it wished Fresenius to consider, but Akorn has declined that offer,” it said in a statement. \nA spokesman for Fresenius said Akorn had violated other requirements of the acquisition agreement, including its obligation to operate the business in the ordinary course after signing of the agreement, and it had not given Fresenius reasonable access to company information \nFresenius had hoped the acquisition of Akorn would help it offer a wider choice of drugs to hospitals and pharmacies. \nFresenius confirmed its guidance for adjusted group sales to rise between 5 and 8 percent in constant currencies in 2018, with adjusted net income expected to increase between 6 and 9 percent. \nEarlier on Sunday, subsidiary Fresenius Medical Care (FMC) ( FMEG.DE ), cut its 2018 sales target. \nFresenius is due to report full first quarter results on May 3.
