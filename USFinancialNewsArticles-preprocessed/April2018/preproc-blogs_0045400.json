Subscribe to WSJ Pro Cybersecurity for in-depth coverage on cybersecurity trends, breaches and best practices. Good morning. The opportunity cost for U.S. companies caught in the nascent U.S.-China trade war is becoming apparent. The costs will be felt among tech companies and perhaps over time, among their customers, too. Alphabet Inc. ‘s Google relies on several Chinese companies to distribute its Android apps to millions of less-affluent smartphone users, but rising trade tensions between China and the U.S. are making those partnerships more risky, the WSJ’s Douglas MacMillan and Liza Lin report .\nEarlier the U.S. barred the device manufacturer, ZTE Corp. of China, from working with American companies, meaning that the specially made Android software that powers its low-cost phone is off-limits. “ZTE was the first company to carry the ‘Android Go’ operating system on a phone built for the U.S. market. The $80 Tempo Go, released on March 30, features new versions of popular mobile apps, such as Google Maps and Gmail, designed to load faster and take up less space on lower-cost phone models,” the Journal reports.\n“Because Tempo Go has only a fraction of the computing power of a standard smartphone, Google’s apps will generally work much better on it than those made by other companies,” the Journal says, citing Neil Shah, an analyst with research firm Counterpoint.\nCustomer experience is a competitive differentiator in the digital age. Digital customers can be fickle and hard to satisfy bunch. The customer experience, that is, making each of a company’s clients feel special, increasingly is the key factor for a business to stand out from its competitors, says CIO Journal Columnist Irving Wladawsky-Berger .\nTECHNOLOGY NEWS \nThe median worker at Amazon.com makes $28,446 a year—much less than the $240,430 median at Facebook Inc LUCAS JACKSON/REUTERS Amazon’s typical worker is in a warehouse. Amazon.com Inc. pays more like a warehouse than a tech company with the median worker making $28,446 in annual salary. Most of the roughly half-million employees at Amazon don’t write code, the Journal reports . They unload trucks, drive forklifts and walk miles collecting products to fill orders—all for around the same pay as workers in other companies’ warehouses. By comparison the median salary at Facebook Inc. is $240,430.\nChina looks to close tech gap with U.S. Chinese President Xi Jinping over the weekend outlined an updated vision for China’s future as an internet and technology power, pledging more state support for sectors caught in the cross-hairs of a trade fight with the U.S., the WSJ’s Josh Chin reports .\nGoogle, not Facebook, has more of your data. Following Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s visit to Washington, D.C. to talk about the company’s data practices could Google be next? “Alphabet’s Google is a far bigger threat by many measures: the volume of information it gathers, the reach of its tracking and the time people spend on its sites and apps,” WSJ Columnist Christopher Mims reports .\nPayments, fraud flourish on Zelle. The New York Times looks at fraud surrounding mobile-payment platform Zelle, developed with the support of big banks to compete with PayPal Inc. ‘s Venmo. “The same features that make Zelle so useful for customers, its speed and ubiquity, have made it irresistible to thieves,” the NYT reports .\nFormer Wall Street regulator focuses on blockchain. Gary Gensler, former head of the Securities and Exchange Commission and now a blockchain expert at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management, says Ether and Ripple, two of the three most popular cryptocurrencies in the U.S., likely violate regulations. He believes they should be categorized as securities, the New York Times reports , a move that would make both harder to buy and sell.\nCorporate anti-hacker group gains strength. An international cyber intelligence-sharing alliance, which claims to have slowed the spread of WannaCry and other attacks, has doubled its membership over the past year, the FT reports . Cyber Threat Alliance members include Symantec Corp. and Palo Alto Networks Inc. as well as 11 new members that have signed up in the past year.\nJustice Department probes U.S. wireless carriers. The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating whether U.S. wireless carriers and an industry trade group joined forces to make it harder for cellphone subscribers to change providers, according to people familiar with the investigation. The Journal’s Drew FitzGerald and Brent Kendall have more .\nEVERYTHING ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW \nGlobal stocks started the week slightly lower as investors parsed a mixed set of corporate results , with equities showing only a muted response to a selloff in bonds that sent the 10-year Treasury yield near 3%. (WSJ)\nGE’s unraveling has wiped out roughly $140 billion in stock-market wealth in the past year, not just for big Wall Street firms but among former employees who, like many small investors, long believed the company invincible. (WSJ)\nSlower to globalize than many other sectors , the U.S. hospital industry is now looking beyond American borders for deals in Asia and other markets, where it hopes to hedge exposure to domestic pressures. (WSJ)\nA mother of four who helped draw national attention to the drinking water crisis in Flint, Mich., is among this year’s recipients of the Goldman Environmental Prize , the green world’s equivalent of an Oscar.
