In this expanded role, Singh will head corporate strategy, finance, enterprise technology and operations, and will focus on strategically positioning the business for growth and transforming the supply chain and delivery organization within the business.\nSingh joined News America Marketing in 2016 after a long career at News Corp where he held several leadership positions having first joined the group in 2002. Most recently he was SVP of Finance at News Corp, where he led global financial planning and several strategic projects for the office of the CEO, including the integration of acquisitions into the News Corp portfolio. During his career, Singh has served in numerous executive financial roles within media and ecommerce businesses and is an alumni of PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n“Ajay is an incredibly talented executive with a proven track record in finance, operations management, and strategy with transformative companies,” said Marty Garofalo, News America Marketing CEO. “His ability to align people and resources to drive economic growth has made him an invaluable part of our senior leadership team, and I look forward to continue working with him on delivering industry-leading services to our customers.”\nNataraj Iyer also joins News America Marketing as a Senior Vice President, General Manager for the At Home/Print network. He will report to the CEO and will be accountable for the company’s FSI, Custom Media and Smart Source Direct groups to drive growth and profitability, as well as collaborate in the data transformation of print, and its connection to the digital network.\nIyer brings over 30 years of experience in consumer packaged goods marketing, retail and manufacturing. He most recently was at CVS Health where he was the Senior Director Store Brands, Brand Management. Prior to CVS, he held several leadership positions over the course of 26 years at Procter & Gamble in both manufacturing and marketing, including roles working with top retailers and in the incentives space.\n“Thanks to Nataraj, our At Home/Print portfolio will have the focus it needs to unlock the growth potential of our business. His wide-ranging experiences in brand management will help us to identify, innovate and implement strategies that have a greater impact in solving problems and creating value for our clients,” said Garofalo.\nFinally, Mohan Sivasankar joins News America Marketing as Senior Vice President, Operations, with responsibility for manufacturing, distribution, procurement and supply chain.

He has a Bachelor's in Engineering from India, Masters in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research from Texas Tech and MBA from Peter F Drucker Graduate School of Management in Claremont, CA.\n“I couldn’t be more excited to have Mohan focus on driving efficiencies, improving process management, and supporting the transformation of our Sales and Field organizations,” said Garofalo. “Mohan is joining News America Marketing at a critical time when we are requiring his leadership and operational excellence, as we prepare to connect the dots between more stores, more touchpoints and more insights.”\nAbout News America Marketing\nNews America Marketing (NAM) is the premier marketing partner of some of the world’s most well-known brands, and its broad network of shopper media, incentive platforms and custom merchandising services influences the purchasing decisions of online and offline shoppers across the U.S. and Canada.
