Sales in the Codman Specialty Surgical segment increased 51.1% compared to the first quarter of 2017, driven by the acquired revenues from Codman Neurosurgery, as well as strong capital sales of CUSA® Clarity. Sales in the Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies segment increased 18.2%, reflecting a full quarter of sales from Derma Sciences and strength in both our regenerative technologies, as well as our ankle and shoulder portfolios.\nTotal organic revenues increased 3.0% over the first quarter of 2017, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and the effect of currency exchange rates, slightly ahead of our expectations.\n\"We are off to a strong start in 2018, which gives us the confidence to increase our full-year 2018 financial guidance,\" said Peter Arduini, Integra's president and chief executive officer. \"We are pleased with the progress of the Codman integration and continued progress in the OTT channel expansion. We expect to see organic growth accelerate in the remainder of the year.\"\nThe company reported GAAP net income of $11.0 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to GAAP net income of $6.4 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, in first quarter of 2017. The increase in GAAP net income results from higher revenues, better operating expense leverage, and a lower tax rate.\nThe adjusted measures discussed below are computed with the adjustments to GAAP reporting that are set forth in the attached reconciliation.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 was $83.2 million, or 23.3% of revenue, compared to $55.2 million, or 21.3% of revenue, in the first quarter of 2017. The margin improvement was largely based on better operating expense leverage, mostly from general and administrative costs.\nAdjusted net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $46.1 million, an increase of 49.4% from the prior year's quarter. Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2018 were $0.58, an increase of 48.7% over the prior year's quarter.\n2018 Full-Year Outlook\nThe company is raising its full-year 2018 revenue guidance by $10 million to a new range of $1.47 billion to $1.49 billion, based on the strong performance of the Codman Specialty Surgical segment in the first quarter of 2018, as well as a higher benefit expected from foreign currency translation. The company is raising its full-year 2018 GAAP and adjusted earnings per share guidance range by $0.08 to a new range of $0.69 to $0.77 and $2.34 to $2.42, respectively.\nThe company is reiterating its full-year 2018 guidance for organic sales to be approximately 5.0%.\n\"In addition to the strong revenue performance in the quarter, we were pleased with the significant improvement in EBITDA margin and strong operating cash flow,\" said Glenn Coleman, Integra's chief financial officer. \"This puts us on track to achieve the high-end of our full-year guidance for these metrics for the remainder of this year.\"\nIn the future, the company may record, or expects to record, certain additional revenues, gains, expenses, or charges as described in the Discussion of Adjusted Financial Measures below, which will be excluded from the calculation of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per share for historical periods and in adjusted earnings per share guidance.\nConference Call and Presentation Available Online\nIntegra has scheduled a conference call for 8:30 AM ET today, Wednesday, April 25, 2018, to discuss financial results for the first quarter and forward-looking financial guidance.

Organic revenues consist of total revenues excluding the effects of currency exchange rates, acquired revenues and product discontinuances. Adjusted EBITDA consists of GAAP net income from continuing operations, excluding: (i) depreciation and amortization; (ii) other income (expense); (iii) interest income and expense; (iv) income taxes; and (v) those operating expenses also excluded from adjusted net income. The measure of adjusted net income consists of GAAP net income, excluding: (i) global enterprise resource planning (\"ERP\") implementation charges; (ii) structural optimization charges; (iii) acquisition-related charges; (iv) intangible asset amortization expense; and (v) discontinued product lines charges; (vi) income tax impact from adjustments, and other items. The adjusted earnings per diluted share measure is calculated by dividing adjusted net income attributable to diluted shares by diluted weighted average shares outstanding. The measure of free cash flow consists of GAAP net cash provided by continuing operating activities from continuing operations less purchases of property and equipment. The adjusted free cash flow conversion measure is calculated by dividing free cash flow by adjusted net income.\nReconciliations of GAAP revenues to adjusted revenues and GAAP Adjusted Net Income from continuing operations to adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted net income, and GAAP earnings per diluted share to adjusted earnings per diluted share all for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, and the free cash flow and free cash flow conversion for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, appear in the financial tables in this release.\nThe Company believes that the presentation of organic revenues and the various adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share, free cash flow and free cash flow conversion measures provide important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and results of operations. For further information regarding why Integra believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors, the specific manner in which management uses these measures, and some of the limitations associated with the use of these measures, please refer to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K regarding this earnings press release filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This Current Report on Form 8-K is available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov or on our website at www.integralife.com .\nINTEGRA LIFESCIENCES HOLDINGS CORPORATION\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(UNAUDITED)\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Total revenues, net $ 357,082 $ 258,636 Costs and expenses: Cost of goods sold 144,222 86,585 Research and development 18,325 15,494 Selling, general and administrative 163,566 142,497 Intangible asset amortization 5,390 4,101 Total costs and expenses 331,503 248,677 Operating income 25,579 9,959 Interest income 76 7 Interest expense (18,768 ) (5,131 ) Other income (expense), net 2,245 (90 ) Income before taxes 9,132 4,745 Income tax (benefit) (1,860 ) (1,649 ) Net income $ 10,992 $ 6,394 Net income per share: Diluted net income per share $ 0.14 $ 0.08 Weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted net income per share 79,834 78,394 Segment revenues and growth in total revenues excluding the effects of currency exchange rates, acquisitions, and discontinued products are as follows:\n(In thousands)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Change Codman Specialty Surgical $ 236,115 $ 156,290 51.1 % Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies 120,967 102,346 18.2 % Total revenues $ 357,082 $ 258,636 38.1 % Impact of changes in currency exchange rates (4,893 ) - Less contribution of revenues from acquisitions (1) (91,629 ) - Less contribution of revenues from discontinued and divested products (2) (2,572 ) (8,073 ) Total organic revenues $ 257,988 $ 250,563 3.0 % (1) Acquisitions include Codman Neurosurgery, Derma Sciences and TGX Medical\n(2) Organic revenue has been restated for 2017 to account for divestitures related to the Codman acquisition\nItems included in GAAP net income from continuing operations and location where each item is recorded are as follows:\n(In thousands)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018\nItem Total Amount COGS(a) SG&A(b) Amort.(c) OI&E(d) Tax(e) Global ERP implementation charges $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — Structural optimization charges 1,603 1,005 598 — — — Acquisition and integration related charges (1) 28,886 12,287 16,599 — — — Intangible asset amortization expense 16,944 11,554 — 5,390 — — Estimated income tax impact from above adjustments and other items (12,279 ) — — — — (12,279 ) Total adjustments $ 35,154 $ 24,846 $ 17,197 $ 5,390 $ — $ (12,279 ) Depreciation expense 10,152 — — — — — a) COGS - Cost of goods sold\nb) SG&A - Selling, general and administrative\nc) Amort. - Intangible asset amortization\nd) OI&E - Interest (income) expense, net and other (income) expense, net\ne) Tax - Income tax expense\n(1) Acquisition related charges are primarily associated with the Derma Sciences and Codman Neurosurgery acquisitions and include banking, legal, consulting and other expenses.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2017\n(In thousands)\nItem Total Amount COGS (a) SG&A (b) Amort.
