Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged the warring sides in Yemen on Tuesday to reach a political settlement to end a conflict that is now in its fourth year and has left 22 million people in urgent need of aid. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres adresses the media during a news conference after the High-Level Pledging Event for the Humanitarian Crisis in Yemen, in Geneva, Switzerland, April 3, 2018. REUTERS/Pierre Albouy \nHis Special Envoy Martin Griffiths will head to the United Arab Emirates, Oman and the Yemeni government-held city of Aden in the drive for peace, Guterres told reporters. \nGriffiths has already held talks with both sides in a war that has drawn in regional powers, meeting Houthi authorities who hold the capital Sanaa as well as internationally-recognised Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and Saudi officials in Riyadh. \nGuterres said he saw “positive perspectives” for preparing a plan of action “to lead to an effective inter-Yemeni dialogue able to achieve a political solution, with of course the involvement of all those that are relevant in this conflict”.

L to R: Deputy Prime Minister of Sweden and Minister for International Development Cooperation and Climate Isabella Lovin, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Assistant Director General, Head of Humanitarian Aid Department and Head of the Swiss Humanitarian Aid Unit Manuel Bessler and U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Mark Lowcock attend a news conference after the High-Level Pledging Event for the Humanitarian Crisis in Yemen, in Geneva, Switzerland, April 3, 2018. REUTERS/Pierre Albouy \nGuterres was speaking on the sidelines of a U.N. pledging conference a day after an air strike by the Saudi-led coalition that supports Hadi’s government killed 12 civilians in the coastal city of Hodeidah. Houthi forces later targeted Saudi Arabia’s southern border area with a missile. \nHe announced that more than $2 billion has been pledged towards a U.N. humanitarian appeal of $3 billion for Yemen this year. It includes $930 million from Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which lead the coalition air strikes. \nWhen the Houthis fired missiles at Riyadh last November, the Western-backed coalition responded by shutting Yemen’s airports and ports. The United Nations said that blockade raised the danger of mass starvation and it was partially lifted. \nGuterres told the conference: “All ports must remain open to humanitarian and commercial cargo, the medicines, food and the fuel needed to deliver them.” Slideshow (8 Images) \nMost humanitarian aid enters through Hodeidah but the government accuses Houthis who control the port of smuggling weapons through it. \nYemeni Foreign Minister Abdel-Malek al-Mekhlafi called for a return to the negotiating table and said that his government was working to open ports and airports to aid. \n“We need to find the ideal solution which is a return to the talks table, to put an end the war, to return to a sustainable system supported by the people of Yemen,” he said. \nThe U.N.’s World Food Programme is providing food rations to 7 million Yemenis, up from 3 million last year, Elisabeth Rasmussen, WFP assistant executive director, told the talks. \nBut Dr. Nevio Zagaria, the World Health Organisation (WHO) representative in Yemen, said that child malnutrition rates are rising. About 1.8 million children under age five are acutely malnourished while 400,000 suffer from severe acute malnutrition, which can be deadly. \n“In Hajjah, I saw a baby weighing 2.6 kilos (5.7 pounds) who was six months old. Its twin died the week before,” Zagaria told Reuters. \nAfter more than one million Yemenis were found with apparent cholera last year, WHO is shipping vaccines to avoid a repeat of the epidemic that killed 2,267 people, he said. Some 1.4 million doses out of 4.4 million planned are on their way via Nairobi. \n“The rainy season is starting, so we need to use the window of opportunity to start a vaccination campaign,” he said.
