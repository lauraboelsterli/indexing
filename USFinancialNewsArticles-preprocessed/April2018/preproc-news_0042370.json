    "text": "FAIRFIELD, Conn., April 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Acme United Corporation (NYSE American:ACU) today announced that net sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $31.7 million compared to $27.7 million in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 14%.\nNet income was $765,000 or $0.21 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $659,000, or $0.18 per diluted share, for the comparable period last year, an increase of 16% in net income and 17% in diluted earnings per share.\nWalter C. Johnsen, Chairman and CEO said, “We have just completed another record first quarter in sales and earnings. All of our major product groups and our international businesses contributed, with especially strong growth in our first aid and safety products, where we have been gaining industrial customers through our patented SmartCompliance System. Continuing the trend we have been seeing since 2013, our on-line sales were robust. This was a strong start for 2018, and we have many plans to continue introducing new products and applications that leverage our proprietary technologies, our diverse customer base and our global reach.”\nFor the first quarter of 2018, net sales in the U.S. segment increased 13% compared to the same period in 2017. The sales increase was mainly due to market share gains in first aid and safety, growth in Westcott office scissors, and strong performance from the Camillus, DMT, and Cuda knives and sharpening tools.\nNet sales in Canada for the first quarter of 2018 increased 12% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currency compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to gains in the school and office channel and higher sales of Camillus knives.\nEuropean net sales for the first quarter of 2018 increased 27% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currency compared to the first quarter of 2017, mainly due to new customers in the office products channel, growth of DMT products, and strong e-commerce demand for these products.\nGross margin was 38.2% in the first quarter of 2018 versus 38.1% in the comparable period last year.\nThe Company is providing financial guidance for 2018 of approximately $140 million in revenues, $5.7 million in net income, and $1.53 earnings per share. This compares to sales of $130.6 million, non-GAAP net income of $5.3 million and earnings per share of $1.42 for 2017. (As previously reported, the Company’s GAAP net income of $4.1 million for 2017 included a $1.2 million non-cash tax charge related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.)\nThe Company’s bank debt less cash on March 31, 2018 was $43.7 million compared to $38.2 million on March 31, 2017. During the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2018, the Company purchased its manufacturing and distribution facility in Vancouver, WA for $4.0 million and distributed $1.4 million in dividends on its common stock.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nAcme United will hold a conference call to discuss its quarterly results, which will be broadcast on Friday, April 20, 2018, at 12:00 p.m. EDT.
