    "text": "April 6, 2018 / 6:03 PM / Updated 14 minutes ago Expert Views: Fed's Powell sees more gradual rate hikes Reuters Staff 6 Min Read \n(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve will likely need to keep raising interest rates to keep inflation under control, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in a speech on the economic outlook that did not address the economic risks of rising trade tensions. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell delivers the semi-annual Monetary Policy Report to the House Financial Services Committee hearing in Washington, DC, U.S., February 27, 2018. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/Files \nIn his first speech on the economic outlook since assuming the helm at the U.S. central bank on February 5, Powell said the labour market appeared close to full employment and that inflation was poised to rebound in the coming months. KEY POINTS: \n* Fedâ€™s Powell says he and his colleagues believe U.S. economy will require further gradual interest rates increases \n* Powell: risks to economic outlook are roughly balanced \n* Powell makes no mention of trade tensions in speech \n* Powell: inflation could rise to unwelcome levels if Fed waited for inflation and employment to hit its goals; sees 12-month inflation readings moving up notably this spring",
