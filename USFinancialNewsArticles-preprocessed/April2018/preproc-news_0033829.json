FILE PHOTO: Rolls of wire are seen at the plant of German steel company Arcelor Mittal in Duisburg April 19, 2013. REUTERS/Ina Fassbender \nBut they warned in a report that an escalation of a trade dispute between major economic blocs would have a big impact on German exports and the economy, which they expect to grow by 2.2 percent this year and by 2.0 percent in 2019. \nThe institutes also said an upswing in Europe’s largest economy was losing momentum.
