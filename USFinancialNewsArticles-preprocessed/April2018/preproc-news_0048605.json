    "text": "ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras on Monday ruled out any trade-off with Turkey in efforts to secure the release of two detained Greek soldiers and said Ankara appeared to be moving further away from Europe.\nFILE PHOTO: Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras attends a cabinet meeting at the parliament in Athens, Greece April 3, 2018. REUTERS/Costas Baltas/File Photo The soldiers were arrested in March after crossing a densely forested part of the border in bad weather and face charges of illegal entry in Turkey. Ankara has also been angered by Athens’ refusal to extradite eight Turkish commandos seeking asylum in Greece.\nThe disputes over the soldiers have further sharpened friction between the two NATO allies, which have long been at odds over issues ranging from airspace over the Aegean Sea to the ethnically split island of Cyprus.\n“Turkey looks like a country ... at risk of losing its orientation and moving away from its European targets,” Tsipras told lawmakers of his ruling Syriza party.\nTurkey is a candidate to join the European Union, though accession talks have effectively stalled due to a range of issues including the country’s human rights record.\nTsipras said there could be no quid pro quo in the efforts to secure the release of the Greek soldiers.\n“We reject, in the most categorical manner, unacceptable preconditions,” he said.\nIn an interview with private Turkish broadcaster NTV on April 21 Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan appeared to float the possibility of handing over the two Greek soldiers if Athens returned the eight Turkish commandos.\nGreek courts have repeatedly rejected Turkish requests to extradite the group, who commandeered a helicopter to flee Turkey as a coup against Erdogan crumbled in July 2016. Ankara says they were involved in the putsch and demands they be returned to face trial.\nTurkey has accused Greece of harboring its enemies, a claim rejected by Athens.\nBut Tsipras also said on Monday he welcomed recent comments by Erdogan on the “need and value” of peaceful relations with Greece.\nReporting By Michele Kambas; Editing by Gareth Jones\n 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
