    "text": "April 26, 2018 / 11:31 PM / Updated 19 minutes ago Tesla's board against proposal to require independent chairman Reuters Staff 2 Tesla Inc’s board recommended on Thursday that shareholders vote against a proposal that would require the electric car maker’s chairman to be an independent director, ahead of its annual meeting. FILE PHOTO: Tesla CEO Elon Musk unveils the Roadster 2 during a presentation in Hawthorne, California, U.S., November 16, 2017. Tesla/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo\nElon Musk, chief executive of Tesla, is also the chairman of its board and owns a 20 percent stake in the company.\nIn an SEC filing here , the board stated that its structure is consistent with majority practice at large public companies and it already has seven independent directors.\nThe filing identified the individual who submitted the proposal as Jing Zhao of Concord, California, who said he is the beneficial owner of 12 shares of Tesla’s common stock.\nThe board also mentioned that Musk already holds senior positions as the chairman of SolarCity and Space X, where he is also the CEO.\nTesla is set to hold its 2018 annual meeting of stockholders on June 5.\n(This story has been refiled to correct fourth paragraph, identifying individual behind shareholder proposal.)
