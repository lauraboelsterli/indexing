    "text": "LAS VEGAS, April 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Galaxy Gaming, Inc. (OTCQB:GLXZ), a developer, manufacturer and distributor of casino table games and enhanced systems, announced today its results for the quarter and fiscal year ending December, 31, 2017.\nFinancial Highlights\nQ4 2017 vs. Q4 2016\nRevenue increased 21% to $3,891K\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 26% to $1,465K\nPre-tax income increased 4,392% to 412K\nNet loss of $66K vs net income of $112K\nFull Year 2017 vs. Full Year 2016\nRevenue increased 19% to $14,856K\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased 3% to $5,084K\nPre-tax income decreased 78% to 553K\nNet loss of $11K vs net income of $1,765K\nBalance Sheet Improvements (vs. December 31, 2016)\nCash increased 51% to $3,486K\nTotal debt (gross) decreased 14% to $9,648K\nStockholders’ equity increased 18% to $5,462K\nExecutive Comments\n“We finished the year well, with year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter of 21%,” stated Todd Cravens, Galaxy’s President and CEO. \"More importantly, revenue growth exceeded expense growth, resulting in year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA for the first time this year. We will continue to make additions in headcount and other resources to support our long-term growth, but we are hopeful that we can deliver increases in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA in 2018.”\n“We had revenue growth of 19% for the year compared to 14% for 2016 and 11% for 2015. We had a small loss for the year but were profitable (before tax expense) in Q4,” said Harry Hagerty, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer. “Our cash flow remains strong. We paid down debt by 14% to $9.6 million and were still able to increase cash by more than 50% to $3.5 million. We were comfortably in compliance with the financial covenants in our debt instruments at year-end. In 2018, we will seek to capitalize on our cash and cash flow to reduce the cost and increase the flexibility of our capital position.”\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this release may constitute forward-looking statements, which involve a number of risks and uncertainties.
