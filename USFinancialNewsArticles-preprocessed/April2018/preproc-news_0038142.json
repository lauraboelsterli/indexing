REUTERS/Damir Sagolj/File Photo \nThe data points to continued resilience in the world’s second-largest economy even as its export outlook is being clouded by escalating tensions with the United States, its largest trading partner. \nAnalysts polled by Reuters had expected gross domestic product (GDP) to expand 6.7 percent in the January-March quarter, slowing only marginally from 6.8 percent growth in the previous two quarters. Related Coverage China March industrial output up 6.0 percent, misses expectations, January-March investment growth slows \nGrowth remained comfortably above the government’s target of around 6.5 percent for the full year, which could give policymakers more confidence to step up efforts to reduce risks in the financial system and clean up the environment. \nOn a quarterly basis, GDP in the first quarter grew 1.4 percent, compared with revised growth of 1.6 percent in October-December, the National Bureau of Statistics said. \nAnalysts had expected growth of 1.5 percent on a quarterly basis.
