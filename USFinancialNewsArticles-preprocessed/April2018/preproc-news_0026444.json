    "text": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla., April 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Solitron Devices, Inc. (OTCBB:SODI) (“Solitron” or the “Company”) today announced an update on recent financial results.\nFor the quarter ended February 28, 2018 (unaudited) (fourth quarter of fiscal 2018):\nSales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 increased by 25% to approximately $1.9 million versus approximately $1.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Bookings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased by 39% to approximately $4.0 million versus approximately $5.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Backlog at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased by 13% to approximately $7.3 million versus approximately $8.3 million at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Total cash and securities was approximately $2.6 million at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 versus approximately $3.1 million at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Accounts receivable at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was approximately $1.4 million versus approximately $0.7 million at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Total liabilities at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was approximately $1.4 million versus approximately $0.9 million at the end of fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nFor the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 (unaudited):\nSales in fiscal 2018 increased by 25% to approximately $9.3 million versus approximately $7.4 million in fiscal 2017. Bookings in fiscal 2018 decreased by 17% to approximately $8.3 million versus $9.9 million in fiscal 2017.\nWhile sales increased by 25% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 versus the prior year fiscal quarter they still fell short of management’s expectations. The shortfall related to the continuation into the fourth quarter of the issues noted in our previous press release announcing preliminary unaudited third quarter results: 1) difficulties encountered in manufacturing some products along with extensive qualification testing for a distribution agreement entered into in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, and 2) delivery problems by a supplier of raw materials used in two of our larger contracts. We have begun shipping the affected items in Q1 of fiscal 2019.\nThe Company is seeking to grow revenues and expects growing pains to be a natural part of that process. We currently do not expect to materially increase our investment in property and equipment; however, we have materially added to our engineering staff in order to address the growing pains and expand our capabilities. The increased cost in fiscal 2018 was approximately $0.5 million, which consisted of hiring additional personnel and replacing some personnel with personnel possessing greater skills and experience that we needed to compensate at a higher level. While the additional cost results in a reduction in earnings in the short term, we believe that it will broaden and strengthen our capabilities which will in the long term lead to higher sales and higher future profitability.\nAs noted above, bookings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 were approximately $4.0 million versus approximately $5.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Approximately $0.8 million of the reduction was due to a reduction in the size of a large order versus the prior year. This was expected, as we had been informed by the customer that there would be two orders instead of the typical one. The second order is expected to be awarded toward the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2019. In aggregate, the two orders are expected to be approximately $1.5 million larger than in prior years.\nThe investigation pertaining to certain matters relating to the Company’s historical inventory reserves is ongoing. Depending on the results of the investigation, the Audit Committee will determine whether a restatement of previously issued financial statements is necessary. The results of the investigation may also impact management’s review of the Company’s inventory policies and assessment to date regarding the extent to which inventory will be written down for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2017 and result in changes to management’s prior review and assessments. The Company intends to take the appropriate measures to correct any gaps or deficiencies in internal controls that may be discovered in the investigation to ensure that the financial statements are complete and accurate in all material respects.\nThese preliminary, unaudited results for the fourth quarter and fiscal years ended 2017 and 2018 are based on management's review of operations for those periods and the information available to the Company as of the date of this press release and remain subject to the completion of the Company's review procedures and the audit of the Company’s annual financial statements by an independent registered public accounting firm to be retained by the Company. Final adjustments and other material developments may arise between the date of this press release and the date the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 28, 2018. Our current independent registered public accounting firm has not reviewed or performed any procedures with respect to the preliminary financial information presented for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018, nor has it completed the audit for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2017.\nThe information presented in this press release should not be considered a substitute for the financial information to be filed with the SEC in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 once it becomes available. The Company has no intention or obligation to update the preliminary estimated unaudited financial results in this release prior to filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 28, 2018.\nAbout Solitron Devices, Inc.\nSolitron Devices, Inc., a Delaware corporation, designs, develops, manufactures and markets solid state semiconductor components and related devices primarily for the military and aerospace markets.
