    "text": "HONG KONG, April 27 (Reuters) - Ping An’s Good Doctor online healthcare platform has raised $1.12 billion in its initial public offering, pricing its shares at the top of its range in Hong Kong’s largest new listing this year, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.\nThe company - full name Ping An Healthcare and Technology Co Ltd - which operates China’s largest internet healthcare platform, also known as Ping An Good Doctor, priced 160 million shares at the top of a HK$50.80–$54.80 range, they said.\nHong Kong will implement new listing rules from Monday April 30 to attract more so-called new economy companies, mainly in the technology and biotech sectors, as part of efforts to compete with New York.\nThe sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media. A Ping An Group representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment. (Reporting by Fiona Lau of IFR and Julie Zhu; Editing by Edwina gibbs)\n ",
