    "text": "April 12, 2018 / 6:06 AM / Updated an hour ago Manager Wenger reminds Arsenal of Barca exit ahead of CSKA match Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Arsenal will go in with their strongest team and best-possible attitude when they face CSKA Moscow in the second leg of their Europa League quarter-final later on Thursday, manager Arsene Wenger has said. Soccer Football - Europa League - Arsenal Training - Arsenal Training Centre, St Albans, Britain - April 11, 2018 Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger during training Action Images via Reuters/Matthew Childs \nThe north London side hold a 4-1 advantage as they travel to Russia, the same lead Roma overcame with a 3-0 home win against Barcelona in the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday. \nThe French manager used Barcelona’s capitulation to warn his Arsenal players to try and add to their lead rather than sit back and defend. \n“The best way to build on the advantage is to try to win the game, so we will play with our best possible team and have a positive attitude,” Wenger told a news conference. \n“We are in a position where I don’t think we are under threat of complacency... \n“Tuesday night (in Rome) may be a good warning for us but let us not go overboard as well. Yes, we have a big job to do but we are in a strong position and it is how we approach the game that will be vital.” \nArsenal’s progression would mark the first time the Premier League club would reach an European semi-final since 2008/09. \nWenger’s side return to league action against Newcastle United on Sunday.
