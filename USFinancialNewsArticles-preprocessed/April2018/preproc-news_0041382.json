It matters, because it also can be at the root of problematic investment decisions.\n\"If someone is biting their nails during the current market swings, then they need to reassess whether they are invested too aggressively for their personal situation and views on risk,\" said Ryan Fuchs, a certified financial planner with Ifrah Financial Services in Frisco, Texas.\nPhoto by fizkes via Getty Images So far in 2018, volatility largely has ruled the stock market. After peaking on Jan. 26, the major stock indexes zigzagged their way downward before recently ticking up.\nYear to date, the Standard & Poor's 500 index is up 0.58 percent as of April 19 and and the Dow Jones industrial average is down 0.37 percent.\nHowever, the long-running bull market means retirement savers largely have watched the value of their nest egg climb upward for nine years with infrequent corrections and low volatility. For instance, since March 2009 — when stocks began moving upward after the financial crisis — the S&P has returned over 260 percent despite the recent pullback.\nWhile no one can predict with certainty whether lower stock prices will be short-lived or when a bear market will emerge, the current volatility is likely to test the wherewithal of some investors.\nMany financial advisors talk about risk tolerance as a function of your emotional response to swings in the market and how long until you need the money.\nThis can be troublesome if there is a mismatch.\n\"Taking on more risk than you're comfortable with could cause you to panic and sell at the wrong time,\" said Jim Shagawat, a certified financial planner, and president of Windfall Wealth Advisors in Paramus, New Jersey.\n\"Taking on too little risk could lead to lower returns than you had hoped for,\" Shagawat said.\nFor instance, if you are a young retirement saver and have all your money in safer investments because you're afraid of stocks, you run the risk of your return barely beating inflation over decades.\nThis is when a little education can be helpful.\nEric Roberge, a certified financial planner, recently showed a new, 30-year-old client how a portfolio she was considering would have performed during the 17-month bear market that lasted from October, 2007 to March, 2009, when the S&P lost 56.8 percent. The particular mix of stocks and bonds the client was considering would have lost 17 percent.\n\"It's not all in or all out of stocks,\" said Roberge, founder of Beyond Your Hammock in Boston. \"When people realize that, it's amazing how much more comfortable they are.\"\n\nMore from Your Money, Your Future: \nHow to make sure you're investing with the right robo-advisor",
