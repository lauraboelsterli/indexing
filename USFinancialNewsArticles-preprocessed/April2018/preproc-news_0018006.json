    "text": "SANTIAGO, April 10 (Reuters) - The London Metal Exchange will take steps to keep aluminium produced by Russia’s Rusal and sold after the company was placed on a U.S. sanctions list out of its warehouses, LME CEO Matt Chamberlain said on Tuesday.\nThe United States imposed major sanctions on Friday against Russian entities and individuals, including Rusal, one of the world’s largest aluminium producers.\nChamberlain said aluminium that entered LME warehouses before the sanctions were imposed would not be affected.
