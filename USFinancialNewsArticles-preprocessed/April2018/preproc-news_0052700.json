    "text": "April 27, 2018 / 6:21 AM / Updated 2 minutes ago India's Modi invites China's Xi for an informal summit in 2019 Sue-Lin Wong 4 Min Read\nWUHAN, China (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi invited Chinese President Xi Jinping to an informal summit next year as he began an ice-breaking visit to China on Friday in which the giant neighbors are seeking to re-set troubled ties.\nModi is spending only about 24 hours in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, just months after a dispute over a stretch of their high-altitude Himalayan border rekindled fears of war between the Asian nations.\n“I hope such informal summits becomes a tradition between both the countries. I’ll be happy, if in 2019 we can have such an informal summit in India,” Modi said, in comments broadcast in a media center for reporters in Wuhan.\nXi told Modi that their two countries’ influence in world and region was steadily on the rise.\n“Looking ahead, we see a fast pace and bright future for China-India cooperation,” Xi said.\n“China and India are both important engines for global growth and we are central pillars for promoting a multi-polar and globalized world. A good China-India relationship is an important and positive factor for maintaining peace and stability in the world,” he added.\nModi said that as India and China represented 40 percent of the world’s population, they needed to try to work together to tackle global problems.\nStressing the importance of world peace, Modi said both nations have to “make all possible contributions”. Related Coverage China's Xi says hopes to open a new chapter in India ties\nAn Indian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told reporters in Wuhan that Modi’s meeting with Xi was supposed to be half an hour but lasted for more than two hours. The museum visit had also lasted longer than planned.\n“The fact he (Xi) showed him around the museum was a special gesture on his part,” the official added.\nBut despite the rhetoric on Friday, the nations’ differences are significant.\nAs well as disputes over stretches of a 3,500 km (2,200 miles) border, they are bumping up against each other in the Indian Ocean and squabbling over Xi’s signature Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.\nIndia signaled as recently as Tuesday its opposition to the grand trade and transport plan because one of its branches runs through Pakistani-administered Kashmir, which India claims.\nIndia has long been suspicious of China’s traditionally close ties with Pakistan.

India's Press Information Bureau/Handout via REUTERS ATTENTION EDITORS - THIS PICTURE WAS PROVIDED BY A THIRD PARTY. NO RESALES. NO ARCHIVE\nFor its part, China has been concerned about U.S. efforts to draw India into a maritime “quad” of democracies, including Japan and Australia.\nChina is also suspicious of India’s hosting of the Dalai Lama and other exiled Tibetans. INFORMAL SETTINGS\nBut there was no public mention of any differences on Friday.\nEarlier in the day, Modi and Xi viewed antique Chinese artifacts at the Hubei Provincial Museum, where they also exchanged views on boosting dialogue between their two ancient civilizations and how to live peacefully together, China’s state news agency Xinhua said.\nThe two were due to have dinner together later, according to India’s foreign ministry.\nOn Saturday, they will take a walk together and then an hour-long boat-trip, informal settings mostly without aides that both sides are hoping will lead to frank discussions.\nIn a commentary on Friday, the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily said the cultures of both China and India set great store on the concept of harmony, and pointed out the Hubei Provincial Museum had in 2014 held a special exhibition on India.

A plain clothes police office told a Reuters reporter to stop taking pictures.\nA sign at the entrance said it was closed for four days due to “equipment maintenance”.
