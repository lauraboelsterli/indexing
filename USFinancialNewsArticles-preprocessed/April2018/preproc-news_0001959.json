    "text": "April 3, 2018 / 3:30 AM / in 8 hours Japan state-backed fund, others to sell nearly $3 billion of Renesas stock Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nTOKYO (Reuters) - Renesas Electronics Corp said on Tuesday a state-backed fund and other shareholders would reduce their stakes in the Japanese chip maker, in a sale worth up to 295 billion yen ($2.8 billion) based on the prior day’s closing price. FILE PHOTO: Renesas Electronics Corp's logo is seen on its substrate at the company's conference in Tokyo, Japan, April 11, 2017. REUTERS/Toru Hanai \nThe fund, Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ), will reduce its stake to 33.4 percent from 45.6 percent, a Renesas spokeswoman said. Hitachi Ltd will cut its stake to 3.7 percent from 5.6 percent and NEC Corp will lower its holding to 4.3 percent from 6.4 percent, she said. \nThe price of the shares, which will be sold through the market, will be determined later this month. \nRenesas shares were down 10 percent after the announcement, their lowest since July last year. \nPublic broadcaster NHK, which first reported the news, said the sale by INCJ was aimed at giving the chipmaker management greater freedom to make acquisitions as it seeks to bolster its global competitiveness. \nINCJ rescued cash-strapped Renesas in 2013 with an investment of 150 billion yen ($1.4 billion), and received 69 percent of the chipmaker, but has whittled down its stake as the company regained its footing. \nLast month, INCJ agreed to sell a 4.5 percent stake in Renesas to auto parts supplier Denso Corp. \nRenesas last year bought U.S. chipmaker Intersil Corp for $3.2 billion and its chief executive said it was constantly reviewing its list of potential acquisition targets. \nRenesas was created in 2010 from a merger of NEC’s chip division and Renesas Technology, which itself was established through a merger of the chip units of Hitachi and Mitsubishi Electric Corp.
