It also kept its target of positive adjusted EBITDA in 2019.\nIn February, Delivery Hero reported a 60 percent increase in 2017 sales on a like-for-like basis to 544 million euros, with growth particularly strong in the Middle East and North Africa.\nDelivery Hero, Takeaway.com and Just Eat have built their businesses by creating booking platforms that advertise local restaurants, which handle their own deliveries.
