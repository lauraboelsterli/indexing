    "text": "PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nRegulatory News:\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180405005917/en/\nTikehau Capital (Paris:TKO), the alternative asset management and investment group, has acquired a stake in Filiassur to support the company’s expansion and growth in Europe. Tikehau Capital is investing EUR 30 million in Filiassur, France’s leading direct distributor of personal insurance.\nFiliassur was founded in 2007. Following a period of rapid growth in France driven by its expertise in designing and marketing innovative niche insurance solutions, it now has 300,000 policyholders. Filiassur operates in a market with a large untapped potential: ageing populations and the progressive roll-back of social security systems mean that demand for tailored personal insurance solutions now far outstrips supply.\nTikehau Capital’s investment will provide Filiassur with a fresh impetus as it begins a new phase in its development, focusing on both organic and external growth in France and Europe.\nCommenting on this development, Filiassur CEO Denis Bizien said, “Tikehau Capital’s hallmark entrepreneurial mindset coupled with its financial heft and proactive support will be of huge benefit for the Filiassur group as it steps up its development over the next few months. Both myself and all of the Filiassur teams are absolutely delighted with this partnership.”\nTikehau Capital co-founder Antoine Flamarion said, “we are delighted to be partnering with this dynamic and ambitious management team which has managed to establish Filiassur as France’s leading direct distributor of personal insurance. We firmly believe in Filiassur’s potential and in its management’s ability to accelerate the company’s growth and consolidate its market leadership.”\nAbout Filiassur:\nLaunched in 2007, Filiassur is an insurance broker which originates and distributes personal insurance solutions. The group is the leading direct distribution specialist of personal insurance solutions in France. Filiassur provides outstanding management service quality to its 300,000 clients, recording average claims processing times of 5 days. With close to 600 employees, Filiassur is an international group operating in France, Spain, Italy, Tunisia and Morocco.\nFiliassur is managed by its co-founder Denis Bizien.\nwww.filiassur.fr\nAbout Tikehau Capital:\nTikehau Capital is an asset management and investment Group which manages €13.8bn of assets, with shareholders’ equity of €2.5bn (31.12.2017).
