A British Pound Sterling note is seen in this June 22, 2017 illustration photo. REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration\nThe new forecasts anticipate the next BoE hike to take place in August this year or as late as 2019.\nBefore Friday’s GDP data most economists had expected the central bank to tighten monetary policy in May.\nThe change in banks’ forecasts signals a much weaker outlook for the pound, which has been among the best performing major currencies in 2018.\nLast week expectations of higher rates lifted sterling to its highest since the Brexit referendum in June 2016.\nThe likelihood that the BoE will not hike next month also means bond prices could rally further and presents a more volatile backdrop for the UK stock market.\nUBS scrapped its estimate of a single rate hike in 2018 after the weaker-than-expected growth figures while Nomura, which has long been hawkish on UK interest rates, now sees a first hike in August.\nBank of America Merrill Lynch and Natwest Markets strategists pushed back their May rate hike calls to November.\n“We view the (economic) slowdown as more serious, and see no prospect of hikes in 2018,” said UBS, the world’s largest wealth manager, in a note.\nJohn Wraith, a UBS economist, said inflation could fall back to the central bank’s target of two percent later this year and that concerns about talks between Britain and the European Union over the terms of their divorce could resurface.\nMarket expectations of a rate hike in May tumbled to less than 20 percent from around 50 percent, after GDP data showed Britain’s economy slowed to 0.1 percent growth between January and March, the weakest quarter since 2012.\nEarlier this month the market was pricing in a 90 percent chance of a rate rise.\nThe market is now also forecasting no more than one 25 basis point rate hike over the remainder of 2018, from a near-certain two rate rises expected a fortnight ago.\nSterling GBP=D3 tanked more than one percent to $1.3748 and government bond prices surged in the aftermath of the data.
