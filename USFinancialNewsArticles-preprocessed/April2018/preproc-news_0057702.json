FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - FA Cup Semi-Final - Manchester United v Tottenham Hotspur - Wembley Stadium, London, Britain - April 21, 2018 Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino reacts Action Images via Reuters/Carl Recine\nTottenham suffered an eighth straight FA Cup semi-final defeat last weekend when they were beaten 2-1 by Manchester United. After finishing third and second in their past two Premier League campaigns, Tottenham are fourth this season with 68 points.\nPochettino’s side have not claimed a trophy since the 2008 League Cup and were beaten by Italian side Juventus in the last 16 of the Champions League this season.\n“Of course you always want to win... I think the way we are building our success, we are at a fantastic level so it’s only (a matter of) time,” Pochettino told a news conference ahead of Monday’s league game against 12th-placed Watford.\nThe Argentine played down comments he made following the FA Cup defeat by Jose Mourinho’s United where he suggested that the project at Tottenham would continue “with him or another”.\n“Tottenham is doing a fantastic job developing an amazing project and I only wanted to tell you that this project is long-term. But it is not going to change with us or another coaching staff,” the 46-year-old added.\n“It was not a message I was sending to someone. I was only explaining in the context of the question that the project is so strong, we believe in this project.”\nTottenham are looking to secure a top-four finish to bring Champions League soccer to their new stadium next season.\n“I think the club needs to keep going, keep pushing in this direction, trying to achieve all the things that the club want.” Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Toby Davis",
