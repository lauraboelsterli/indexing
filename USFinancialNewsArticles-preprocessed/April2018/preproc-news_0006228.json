Israeli soldiers are seen next to the border fence on the Israeli side of the Israel-Gaza border, as Palestinians protest on the Gaza side of the border, Israel April 5, 2018. REUTERS/Amir Cohen \nFirearms should only be used as a last resort, and unjustified recourse to their use may amount to wilful killing of civilians, a breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention, U.N. human rights spokeswoman Elizabeth Throssell told a briefing. \nA Palestinian died on Friday of wounds suffered a week ago during protests against Israel along the enclaveâ€™s border, health ministry officials said. That raised to 20 the death toll in confrontations with Israeli soldiers that began on March 30. Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay, editing by Larry King",
