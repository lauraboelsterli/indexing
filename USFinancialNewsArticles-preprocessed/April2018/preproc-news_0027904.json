If implemented, these will very likely damage world growth.\nIn early trade, 10-year bond yields across the single currency bloc were up 2 to 4 basis points higher on the day.\nGermany’s benchmark Bund yield was at 0.549 percent , its highest in three weeks.\nAs U.S. bond yields rose, the gap between 2-year U.S. and German bond yields pushed out to its widest since March 1989 at 296 bps.\nSpain’s 10-year bond yield spread over Germany was at its narrowest in a week at 71 bps after Friday’s Moody’s upgrade.\nMoody’s upgraded Spain’s ratings to Baa1 from Baa2 and said that improvements in the country’s credit profile outweighed a drag from political factors.\nSlovakia is scheduled to sell long-dated bonds later in the session, kicking off this week’s bond supply from the bloc which analysts estimate could reach up to 16-17 billion euros.\nWith redemptions from maturing bonds not expected to kick in until late in the month, that supply pressure was expected to push bond yields higher at the start of the week as investors cheapened existing bonds to make way for new supply.
