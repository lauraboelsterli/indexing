Hoteles City Express has an inventory of more than 15,400 rooms in 30 states and 68 cities in Mexico and three other countries throughout Latin America.\nOur commercial efforts continue not only to be at the forefront of the industry, but also a key element for maximizing our profitability. With occupancy 2.7 percentage points higher than in 1Q17 and positive ADR growth, our RevPar increased 7.0%.\nOur Total Revenues grew by more than 20%, while the Company's productivity was reflected in Operating Income, which grew 1.5 times more quickly than revenues. The Company's Adjusted EBITDA Margin increased by almost 100 bps to 35.1%, which is the highest level of this metric in our history for a first quarter.\nToday more than ever, our innovative platform for operation, distribution and digital marketing continues to drive the Company's profitability. With infrastructure that will allow us to operate more than 200 hotels with minimal cost increases, we are positioned to continue pushing the Company's ambitious growth.\nOur 2018 development plan is advancing as expected. Given our disciplined approach to cost control and our experience in developing hotels we are confident that we will open more than 20 new units over the next 12 months.\nFinally, we are very pleased to tell you that the Company is in the final stages of launching FIBRA STAY. With market interest, unanimous approval at our Shareholders Meeting on February 15, and the conclusion of the initial public offering process getting ever closer, we expect to see FSTAY start trading in the coming weeks.\nWe will continue to work tirelessly to be the best alternative for profitable growth in Mexico and the rest of Latin America.\"\nConference Call Details:\nHoteles City Express will host a conference call to discuss these results.
