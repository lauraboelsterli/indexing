    "text": "WATERSOUND, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The St. Joe Company (NYSE:JOE) (the “Company”) today announced Net Income for the first quarter of 2018 of $0.7 million, or $0.01 per share, compared with Net Income of $4.4 million, or $0.06 per share, for the first quarter of 2017. The first quarter of 2017 includes a $3.5 million benefit from an insurance settlement and $3.1 million in net realized gains from the sale of investments. Excluding Other Income items, the first quarter of 2018 Operating Loss improved by approximately $4.1 million as compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nFirst quarter update includes:\nTotal revenue for 2018 was $19.9 million as compared to $13.5 million in 2017 due to increases in real estate, leasing and timber revenue, partially offset by a decrease in resorts and leisure revenue. Real estate revenue increased to $7.7 million in 2018 as compared to $1.5 million in 2017. This increase was primarily related to the higher volume of lot sales in the Watersound Origins, SouthWood and Breakfast Point communities. There were 106 homesites sold in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 2 homesites sold in the first quarter of 2017. Resorts and leisure revenue decreased in 2018 as compared to 2017 by $0.6 million due to the sale of the short-term vacation rental management business during December 2017, partially offset by an increase in clubs business. The clubs component of this segment’s revenue continues to climb due to increased membership revenue from The Clubs by Joe, the Company’s private membership club. Other operating and corporate expenses declined by $0.3 million in 2018 as compared to 2017. The Company continues to focus on a cost discipline to maintain an efficient cost structure.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company owned approximately 813,000 square feet of rentable commercial space compared to approximately 604,000 as of March 31, 2017. The Company’s overall lease occupancy percentage increased to 89% as of March 31, 2018, as compared to 86% as of March 31, 2017.\nThe Company had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $293.9 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to $303.4 million as of December 31, 2017, a decrease of $9.5 million. The decrease was related to $13.7 million used for stock repurchases, offset by net receipts from the Company’s operations and other activities.\nThe Company adopted ASU 2014-09 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers), as amended, recognizing lot residuals, marketing and other fees as revenue at the time of sale of homesites. For the three 2018, real estate revenue includes approximately $0.7 million of estimated lot residuals, marketing and other fees related to homesites sold in the quarter. Prior to 2018, these lot residuals, marketing and other fees were recognized in revenue when consideration was received in periods subsequent to the sale of the homesite. For the three 2017, real estate revenue includes approximately $0.3 million related to lot residuals, marketing and other fees.\nFinancial data schedules in the back of this press release provide greater detail on business segment performance, summarizing the consolidated results, summary balance sheets, debt schedule and other operating and corporate expenses for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nJorge Gonzalez, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We continue to make progress in our operations, with an increase of $4.1 million as compared to the first quarter of 2017.” Mr. Gonzalez added, “As I mention in my annual letter to shareholders, I believe that the necessary ingredients for prosperity exist in Northwest Florida and extend a personal invitation for you to judge the opportunities for yourself by visiting. In fact, a perfect time to visit is during our upcoming annual meeting scheduled for May 23rd where we will be prepared to discuss our assets and engage with our shareholders.”\nFINANCIAL DATA Consolidated Results (Unaudited) ($ in millions except share and per share amounts) Quarter Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Revenue Real estate revenue $ 7.7 $ 1.5 Resorts and leisure revenue 7.5 8.1 Leasing revenue 3.0 2.6 Timber revenue 1.7 1.3 Total revenue 19.9 13.5 Expenses Cost of real estate revenue 4.2 0.3 Cost of resorts and leisure revenue 7.0 8.8 Cost of leasing revenue 0.8 0.7 Cost of timber revenue 0.2 0.2 Other operating and corporate expenses 5.9 6.2 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2.3 1.9 Total expenses 20.4 18.1 Operating loss (0.5 ) (4.6 ) Investment income, net 3.6 10.4 Interest expense (3.0 ) (3.0 ) Other income, net 0.3 3.7 Income before income taxes 0.4 6.5 Income tax benefit (expense) 0.2 (2.3 ) Net income 0.6 4.2 Net loss attributable to non-controlling interest 0.1 0.2 Net income attributable to the Company $ 0.7 $ 4.4 Net income per share attributable to the Company $ 0.01 $ 0.06 Weighted average shares outstanding 65,476,054 73,970,407\nSummary Balance Sheet (Unaudited) ($ in millions) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Assets Investment in real estate, net $ 332.6 $ 332.6 Cash and cash equivalents 202.6 192.1 Investments – debt securities 46.4 76.3 Investments – equity securities 44.9 35.0 Restricted investments 3.4 4.5 Income tax receivable 8.4 8.4 Claim settlement receivable 5.3 5.3 Other assets 42.7 47.1 Property and equipment, net 11.7 11.8 Investments held by special purpose entities 207.6 207.9 Total assets $ 905.6 $ 921.0 Liabilities and Equity Debt $ 55.5 $ 55.6 Other liabilities 43.8 47.3 Deferred tax liabilities, net 48.5 49.0 Senior Notes held by special purpose entity 176.6 176.5 Total liabilities 324.4 328.4 Total equity 581.2 592.6 Total liabilities and equity $ 905.6 $ 921.0 Debt Schedule (Unaudited) ($ in millions) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Pier Park North joint venture refinanced loan $ 46.6 $ 46.8 Community Development District debt 7.3 7.2 Pier Park outparcel construction loan 1.6 1.6 Total debt $ 55.5 $ 55.6 Other Operating and Corporate Expenses (Unaudited) ($ in millions) Quarter Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Employee costs $ 1.8 $ 1.8 401(k) contribution 1.1 1.2 Property taxes and insurance 1.3 1.4 Professional fees 0.8 1.0 Marketing and owner association costs 0.4 0.4 Occupancy, repairs and maintenance 0.1 0.1 Other 0.4 0.3 Total other operating and corporate expense $ 5.9 $ 6.2\nAdditional Information and Where to Find It\nAdditional information with respect to the Company’s results for the first quarter 2018 will be available in a Form 10-Q that will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be found at the SEC’s website www.sec.gov .\nAnnual Meeting of Shareholders\nAs noted earlier in this press release, the Company’s Annual Meeting of Shareholders will be held on May 23, 2018, at 9:00 a.m., Central Daylight Time, at the WaterColor Inn, 34 Goldenrod Circle, Santa Rosa Beach, Florida 32459.
