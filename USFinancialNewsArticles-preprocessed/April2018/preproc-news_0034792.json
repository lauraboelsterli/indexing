    "text": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Pop star Pink graced the cover of People magazine’s annual beautiful people issue on Wednesday, chosen for what the celebrity publication called “a role model who embodies honesty and confidence.” \n\n51st Country Music Association Awards – Arrivals - Nashville, Tennessee, U.S., 08/11/2017 - Singer Pink and her daughter Willow. REUTERS/Harrison McClary The Grammy-award winning singer, 38, was pictured with her two children, 15-month-old Jameson Moon and Willow Sage, 6, in an issue re-named “The Beautiful Issue,” which included Meghan Markle among more than 70 other female celebrities, and five men. \nThe annual list used to be called “Most Beautiful Woman” but People editor in chief Jess Cagle said it had been renamed “to make clear that the issue is not a beauty contest.” \n\nFILE PHOTO: Singer Pink arrives at the 2014 Vanity Fair Oscars Party in West Hollywood, California, U.S., March 2, 2014. REUTERS/Danny Moloshok/File Photo It features “beautiful women (and a few men) of all shapes, sizes and colors, and celebrates the most beautiful qualities of all: strength, humanity and artistry,” Cagle added. \n\nSlideshow (9 Images) Pink, known for her acrobatic live performances, has scored hits like “What About Us” and “Raise Your Glass” over a 20-year career. \nBut People focused on her skills as a parent with husband Carey Hart. “The thing about parenting is you never know if anything you’re doing is working,” she told the magazine. “That’s been the most humbling thing for me.” \nOther celebrities on the list included “Will & Grace” actress Megan Mullally and African-American comedian Issa Rae in the “stars without make-up section.” \nMarkle, the former “Suits” actress due to marry Britain’s Prince Harry next month, was included in a section called “beautiful inside and out” along with “Wonder Woman” star Gal Gadot, tennis champion Serena Williams, and the four female stars of superhero movie “Black Panther.” \nCanadian rapper Drake, “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, comedian Kumail Nanjiani and gay Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon were the five “men behaving beautifully.” \nThe Beautiful Issue hits U.S. newstands on Friday. \nReporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Chris Reese\n ",
