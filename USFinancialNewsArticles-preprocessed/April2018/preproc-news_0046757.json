    "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Monday reassured Pakistan that relations between the two countries were as firm as ever and would “never rust”, ahead of a meeting this week between President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi that could unnerve Islamabad.\nPakistan’s Foreign Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif (left) and Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi (right) pose after their press conference at the Diaoyutai State Guest House in Beijing, China, April 23, 2018. Madoka Ikegami/Pool via Reuters China and Pakistan like to call each other “all weather friends” and their traditional close ties have long been viewed with suspicion by Pakistan’s neighbour and traditional enemy, India.\nBut Modi has tried to reset relations with Beijing after a years of disagreements over everything from their border to exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, and will hold an informal summit with Xi on Friday and Saturday in China.\nChina will continue to firmly support Pakistan, its top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, told Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif at a meeting in Beijing.\n“We are ready to work together with our Pakistani brothers to undertake the historical mission of national rejuvenation and achieve the great dream of national prosperity and development,” Wang said.\n“In this way, our iron friendship with Pakistan will never rust and be tempered into steel.”\nThere was no mention of the Xi-Modi meeting in comments made in front of reporters.\nPakistan’s Foreign Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif (left) and Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi (right) have a press conference after their meeting at the Diaoyutai State Guest House in Beijing, China, April 23, 2018.
