    "text": "CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Maranon Capital, L.P. today announced that it was Agent for a mezzanine facility and equity co-investment to support Benford Capital Partners, LLC in the acquisition of Specialty Sales, LLC. The management team of Specialty Sales also participated in the transaction. Senior financing was provided by First Merchants Bank.\nFounded in 1999, Specialty Sales is the market leading provider of automated hoof bath systems and the preventative hoof care treatment products utilized in these systems for commercial dairies in the United States. The Company delivers a compelling value proposition to customers as its liquid chemical treatment products significantly reduce the incidence rate of hoof disease, a significant cause of economic loss on commercial dairies. Specialty Sales operates a “razor/razor blade” business model by installing and servicing its best-in-class hoof bath systems, and then selling and delivering its proprietary liquid chemical solution blends on a recurring basis.\nAbout Maranon Capital\nMaranon Capital, L.P. is an alternative investment management firm focused on private credit investments in middle market companies. Maranon’s competitive edge is its multi-product strategies that span the balance sheet with value-added financing and equity co-investments.
