    "text": "2 COMMENTS U.S. stocks fell Friday, as escalating tensions between the U.S. and China exacerbated investors’ fears of an all-out trade war between the world’s largest economies.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 103 points, or 0.4%, to 24401 in recent trading, while the S&P 500 declined 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite slid 0.2%.\nChina forcefully responded to President Donald Trump’s announcement late Thursday that the U.S. is considering an additional $100 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods, saying Beijing would “resolutely counterattack and take new comprehensive measures in response.”\nInvestors worry the tit-for-tat responses could translate into more severe and farther-reaching sanctions that pressure American companies and raise prices for consumers. Such a move could crimp the global economic growth engine that has acted as a key pillar for stocks at a time when many investors were hoping the fiscal stimulative tax cut passed last year would lead to better corporate profits and an even stronger economy.\n“The old expression was ‘talk softly and carry a big stick’ and now we’re going to test ‘scream loudly and do we have a stick?’” said David Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors. “One of these days, when you bluster, you get taken up on it.”\nThe trade worries also knocked bond yields lower, hurting shares of banks, which led the market lower. Shares of Goldman Sachs Group fell 1.1%, while JPMorgan Chase declined 1%.\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 2.799%, according to Tradeweb, from 2.830% on Thursday. Yields move inversely to prices.\nMeanwhile, the latest jobs report for March showed that wages grew at a steady rate, tamping down investors’ inflation fears, even as U.S. employers did less hiring than expected last month, suggesting that a tight labor market is making it more difficult for some businesses to find workers.\n“This should help moderate investors’ expectations for the [Federal Reserve] getting ahead of itself,” said Doug Coté, Voya Investment Management’s chief market strategist.\nWages grew as expected from a year earlier, with average hourly earnings rising 2.7% in March. That further eased worries among some investors that inflation had been rising faster than expected this year and that the Fed would have to hasten its pace of interest-rate hikes to keep the economy from overheating.\nPhoto: Associated Press Still, concerns over the Trump administration’s latest tariff salvo appear to be more pressing.\n“The fact that a trade war is not good to global growth is very obvious, but there hasn’t been enough discussion about how central banks react to this,” said Karen Ward, chief market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.\n“I think the view is that the Fed is going to proceed and continue formalizing, but at the same time I don’t think Jerome Powell will want to see the recovery fade in his first year in office,” she added.\nSpeaking in Italy on Friday, European Central Bank executive board member Benoît Cœuré said the proposed tariffs were already having an impact on funding and markets.\n“While the effects of any tariffs on output and inflation may take time to materialize, falls in equity prices in response to the U.S. announcement to impose a tariff on steel and aluminum and prevailing uncertainty on the scope of any retaliatory measures have already contributed to tighter financial conditions,” Mr. Cœuré said.\nElsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 fell less than 0.1%, following Asian markets broadly lower.\nIn Japan, the Nikkei 225 closed down 0.4%, while South Korea’s Kospi dropped 0.3%.\nHong Kong’s Hang Seng Index bucked the trend of other Asian markets on Friday, rising 1%. The index was catching up on regional market gains Thursday when the city’s markets were closed, but remains down compared with levels before China’s announcement of trade measures on Wednesday.\n— Michael Wursthorn contributed to this article\nRelated Video President Trump says China is forcing U.S. companies to transfer their technology secrets to China.
