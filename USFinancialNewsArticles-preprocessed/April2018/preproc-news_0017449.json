    "text": "April 13, 2018 / 2:38 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Neymar says will be back in a month after foot injury Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nSAO PAULO (Reuters) - Neymar expects to have recovered fully from his foot injury by around mid-May, the Brazil striker said in a TV interview due to air in his homeland on Saturday. Soccer Football - Ligue 1 - Paris St Germain vs Olympique de Marseille - Parc des Princes, Paris, France - February 25, 2018 Paris Saint-Germain’s Neymar warms up before the match REUTERS/Stephane Mahe \nThe 26-year old, who fractured a metatarsal and sprained his ankle while playing for his club Paris St Germain on Feb. 25, was asked when he would be ready. \n“Around a month,” Neymar, whose foot was encased in a protective boot, said in a clip released ahead of time by TV Globo. “But I am progressing well. It’s all in order.” \nThe news will be welcomed by Brazil coach Tite as it means he will have plenty of time to prepare for the World Cup, which kicks off in Russia on June 14. \nBrazil’s first game is against Switzerland on June 17 but the South Americans will play two warm-up matches against Croatia on June 3 and Austria on June 10. \nNeymar became the world’s most expensive footballer when he joined PSG from Barcelona last August for a fee of 222-million euros ($273.6 million). \n($1 = 0.8113 euros)",
