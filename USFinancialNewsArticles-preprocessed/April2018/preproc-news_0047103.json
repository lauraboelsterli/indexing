    "text": "OVERLAND PARK, Kan., April 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- QTS Realty Trust, Inc. (\"QTS\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: QTS) today announced operating results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. In conjunction with its previously announced strategic growth plan, QTS is realigning its product offerings around Hyperscale and Hybrid Colocation, while exiting certain of its C3-Cloud and Managed Services offerings, as well as colocation revenue attached to certain customers in the Cloud and Managed Services business that we expect will not remain with QTS post transition (collectively \"Non-Core\" operations). QTS has realigned information included in this release to focus its guidance and key performance metrics around its Core business, which primarily consists of its Hyperscale and Hybrid Colocation businesses, along with technology and services from its Cloud and Managed Services business that support Hyperscale and Hybrid Colocation customers, which together will be the Company's primary business following the completion of the strategic growth plan. For informational purposes, QTS has excluded its estimated Non-Core business from certain financial and operating statistics below.\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nReported consolidated net loss of $0.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, a decrease compared to net income of $5.6 million for the same period of 2017. Net loss per basic and diluted share was $0.02 for the first quarter of 2018, compared to net income per basic and diluted share of $0.10 for the first quarter of 2017. Reported consolidated FFO available to common shareholders and OP unit holders of $31.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, a decrease of 10.3% compared to FFO of $35.1 million for the same period in 2017. FFO for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 on a fully diluted per share basis was $0.54 per share, a decrease of 13.9% compared to FFO per fully diluted share of $0.63 for the same period of 2017. Reported Core Operating FFO available to common shareholders and OP unit holders of $36.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to Core Operating FFO of $30.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Core Operating FFO for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 on a fully diluted per share basis was $0.64 per share, an increase of 15.4% compared to Core Operating FFO per fully diluted share in the same period of 2017. Core Operating FFO in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017 included a non-cash deferred tax benefit of $0.8 million and $1.9 million, respectively. Reported Core Adjusted EBITDA of $50.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, an increase of 23.4% compared to the same period in 2017. Reported Core NOI of $64.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, an increase of 17.3% compared to the same period in 2017. Recognized total Core revenues of $100.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, an increase of 15.6% compared to the same period in 2017. Signed new and modified renewal Core leases aggregating to $21.0 million of Core incremental annualized rent, net of downgrades, during the first quarter of 2018.\n\"Since announcing our strategic growth plan in February, we have made strong progress in accelerating our growth and profitability as evidenced by near record leasing results and robust underlying growth in our core business in the first quarter,\" said Chad Williams, Chairman and CEO – QTS. \"We are confident that the acceleration enabled by our focused strategic initiatives will continue to differentiate QTS in the industry and drive enhanced future value creation for shareholders.\"\nFinancial Results\nNet loss recognized in the first quarter of 2018 was $0.3 million ($0.02 per basic and diluted share), compared to net income of $5.6 million ($0.10 per basic and diluted share) recognized in the first quarter of 2017. The Company incurred $8.5 million of restructuring expenses in the first quarter of 2018 associated with its planned exit of certain of its C3 – Cloud and Managed Services offerings, of which $4.0 million related to the write-off of certain product related assets, $3.7 million related to employee severance expenses, $0.5 million related to professional fees and $0.3 million related to other miscellaneous restructuring expenses. The Company also incurred $0.9 million of transaction, integration and impairment costs in the first quarter of 2018, compared to transaction, integration, and impairment costs of $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company recognized $2.4 million of income tax benefit compared to $1.5 million of income tax benefit recognized in the first quarter of 2017.\nQTS generated Core Operating FFO of $36.9 million, or $0.64 per fully diluted share, in the first quarter of 2018, which includes a non-cash tax benefit of approximately $0.8 million, compared to Core Operating FFO of $30.7 million, or $0.55 per fully diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017, which included a non-cash tax benefit of approximately $1.9 million. Core Operating FFO for the first quarter of 2018 represents an increase of approximately 20.3% compared to the prior year. Excluding the effects of the Company's non-cash deferred tax benefit, Core Operating FFO was $0.62 per fully diluted share in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.52 per fully diluted share in the first quarter of 2017.\nAdditionally, QTS generated $50.2 million of Core Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 23.4% compared to $40.6 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nQTS generated total Core revenues of $100.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 15.6% compared to $86.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. Core MRR as of March 31, 2018 was $27.9 million compared to Core MRR as of March 31, 2017 of $25.4 million.\nLeasing Activity\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2018, QTS entered into new and modified Core leases aggregating to $36.0 million of annualized rent which includes revenue from new leases plus revenue from modified renewals. Removing non-incremental annualized MRR from modified renewals and deducting downgrades during the period resulted in $21.0 million in Core incremental annualized rent for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Pricing on new and modified leases signed during the first quarter was lower than the prior four quarter average, which was driven by a higher proportion of larger footprint deals compared to prior periods.\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2018, QTS renewed Core leases with total annualized rent of $23.4 million at an average rent per square foot of $234, which was 5.4% higher than the annualized Core rent prior to their respective renewals. There is variability in the Company's renewal rates based on the mix of product types renewed, and renewal rates are generally expected to increase in the low to mid-single digits as compared to pre-renewal pricing. Core Rental Churn (which the Company defines as Core MRR lost in the period to a customer intending to fully exit the QTS platform in the near term compared to total Core MRR at the beginning of the period) was 1.0% for the first quarter of 2018. Consolidated Rental Churn (which the Company defines as consolidated MRR lost in the period to a customer intending to fully exit the QTS platform in the near term compared to consolidated MRR at the beginning of the period) was 1.8% for the first quarter of 2018.\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2018, QTS commenced Core customer leases (which includes new Core customers and also existing Core customers that renewed their lease term) representing approximately $29.8 million of annualized rent at $529 per square foot. Average pricing on Core commenced leases during the first quarter of 2018 increased compared to the prior four quarter average primarily due to a higher proportion of smaller footprint hybrid colocation deals.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Core booked-not-billed MRR balance (which represents Core customer leases that have been executed, but for which lease payments have not commenced as of March 31, 2018) was approximately $4.5 million, or $53.9 million of annualized Core rent, and compares to $3.5 million, or $41.6 million of annualized Core rent and $3.9 million, or $46.8 million of annualized consolidated rent, at December 31, 2017. The Core booked-not-billed balance is expected to contribute an incremental $14.8 million to revenue in 2018 (representing $25.1 million in annualized Core revenues), an incremental $13.4 million in 2019 (representing $17.3 million in annualized Core revenues), and an incremental $11.5 million in annualized Core revenues thereafter.\nDevelopment, Redevelopment, and Acquisitions\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2018 the Company brought online approximately nine megawatts of gross power and approximately 32,000 net rentable square feet (\"NRSF\") of raised floor and customer specific capital at its Atlanta-Metro, Chicago, and Irving facilities at an aggregate cost of approximately $67 million. In addition, during the first quarter of 2018, the Company's significant development activity continued at the Irving, Ashburn, Atlanta-Metro, Chicago, Piscataway and Fort Worth facilities to have space ready for customers in 2018 and forward. The Company expects to bring an additional 82,000 raised floor NRSF into service in 2018 at an aggregate cost of approximately $200 million.\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company completed an acquisition of 61 acres of land in Manassas, Virginia for $24.7 million. This land will support the deployment of a 24 megawatt powered shell lease that was signed concurrently with the acquisition of the land. QTS believes this site can support 85 megawatts of gross power.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company's total debt balance net of cash and cash equivalents was $1.2 billion, resulting in a net debt to annualized Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of 5.7x. This ratio compares to the 5.4x net debt to annualized Adjusted EBITDA reported in the fourth quarter of 2017 and remains in line with Company expectations.\nIn March 2018, QTS issued 4,280,000 shares of 7.125% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (\"Series A Preferred Stock\") with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share, which included 280,000 shares of the underwriters' partial exercise of their option to purchase additional shares. The Company used the net proceeds of approximately $103.2 million to repay amounts outstanding under its unsecured revolving credit facility.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had total available liquidity of approximately $696 million which was comprised of $680 million of available capacity under the Company's unsecured revolving credit facility and approximately $16 million of cash and cash equivalents.\nOn February 20, 2018, the Company authorized payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.41 per share on its common stock for the first quarter of 2018. The $0.41 per share dividend was paid on April 5, 2018 to common stockholders of record at the close of business on March 22, 2018.\n2018 Core Guidance\nReferences to QTS' \"Core\" business refers to the Company's business expected to be retained following the completion of the previously announced strategic growth plan, as described above. The Company is reaffirming its 2018 guidance, as outlined below.\n2018 (1)\n($ in millions except per share amounts)\nLow\nHigh\nCore Revenue\n$\n408\n$\n422\nCore Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n218\n$\n228\nCore Operating FFO per fully diluted share\n$\n2.55\n$\n2.65\nCapital Expenditures (2)\n$\n425\n$\n475\n(1) Guidance for the year ended December 31, 2018 excludes results from the Non-Core business unit.\n(2) Reflects cash capital expenditures and excludes expenditures from acquisitions.\nThe Company expects annual rental churn for the Core business of 3% to 6%.

The Company calculates FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"). FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), adjusted to exclude gains (or losses) from sales of property, real estate-related depreciation and amortization and similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The Company's management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.\nDue to the volatility and nature of certain significant charges and gains recorded in the Company's operating results that management believes are not reflective of its core operating performance, management computes an adjusted measure of FFO, which the Company refers to as Operating FFO. The Company generally calculates Operating FFO as FFO excluding certain non-routine charges and gains and losses that management believes are not indicative of the results of the Company's operating real estate portfolio. The Company believes that Operating FFO provides investors with another financial measure that may facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and, to the extent other REITs calculate Operating FFO on a comparable basis, between REITs.\nOperating FFO and Adjusted Operating Funds From Operations (\"Adjusted Operating FFO\") are non-GAAP measures that are used as supplemental operating measures and to provide additional information to users of the financial statements. The Company calculates Adjusted Operating FFO by adding or subtracting from Operating FFO items such as: maintenance capital investment, paid leasing commissions, amortization of deferred financing costs and bond discount, non-real estate depreciation, straight line rent adjustments, deferred taxes and non-cash compensation.\nThe Company offers these measures because it recognizes that FFO, Operating FFO and Adjusted Operating FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare its operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO, Operating FFO and Adjusted Operating FFO exclude real estate depreciation and amortization and capture neither the changes in the value of the Company's properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and capitalized leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of its properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact its financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, the utility of FFO, Operating FFO and Adjusted Operating FFO as measures of its operating performance is limited. The Company's calculation of FFO may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the NAREIT definition of FFO or do not calculate FFO in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition, the Company's calculations of FFO, Operating FFO and Adjusted Operating FFO are not necessarily comparable to FFO, Operating FFO and Adjusted Operating FFO as calculated by other REITs that do not use the same definition or implementation guidelines or interpret the standards differently from us. FFO, Operating FFO and Adjusted Operating FFO are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered a measure of the Company's results of operations or liquidity or as a substitute for, or an alternative to, net income (loss), cash provided by operating activities or any other performance measure determined in accordance with GAAP, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund its cash needs, including its ability to make distributions to its stockholders.\nCore Operating FFO and Adjusted Core Operating FFO represent Operating FFO and Adjusted Operating FFO of the Company's Core business, respectively, and are used as supplemental performance measures because they reflect results of the portion of the business the Company expects to retain following completion of the strategic growth plan.\nA reconciliation of net income to FFO, Operating FFO and Adjusted Operating FFO on a Core and Non-Core basis is presented below (unaudited and in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nMarch 31, 2017\nCore\nNon-Core\nTotal\nCore\nNon-Core\nTotal\nCore\nNon-Core\nTotal\nFFO\nNet income (loss)\n$\n5,083\n$\n(5,335)\n$\n(252)\n$\n(11,011)\n$\n(5,102)\n$\n(16,113)\n$\n1,621\n$\n3,947\n$\n5,568\nReal estate depreciation and amortization\n31,192\n865\n32,057\n31,676\n863\n32,539\n28,697\n807\n29,504\nFFO\n36,275\n(4,470)\n31,805\n20,665\n(4,239)\n16,426\n30,318\n4,754\n35,072\nPreferred stock dividends\n(328)\n-\n(328)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nFFO available to common shareholders & OP unit holders\n35,947\n(4,470)\n31,477\n20,665\n(4,239)\n16,426\n30,318\n4,754\n35,072\nDebt restructuring costs\n-\n-\n-\n19,992\n-\n19,992\n-\n-\n-\nRestructuring costs\n-\n8,530\n8,530\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTransaction, integration and impairment costs\n920\n-\n920\n303\n9,146\n9,449\n336\n-\n336\nTax benefit associated with restructuring, transaction and integration costs\n-\n(1,635)\n(1,635)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nOperating FFO available to common shareholders & OP unit holders*\n36,867\n2,425\n39,292\n40,960\n4,907\n45,867\n30,654\n4,754\n35,408\nMaintenance Capex\n(930)\n-\n(930)\n(848)\n-\n(848)\n(796)\n-\n(796)\nLeasing commissions paid\n(5,839)\n(71)\n(5,910)\n(5,840)\n(459)\n(6,299)\n(3,749)\n(420)\n(4,169)\nAmortization of deferred financing costs and bond discount\n962\n-\n962\n925\n-\n925\n980\n-\n980\nNon real estate depreciation and amortization\n2,148\n1,709\n3,857\n2,571\n2,030\n4,601\n2,285\n2,158\n4,443\nStraight line rent revenue and expense and other\n(2,509)\n(9)\n(2,518)\n(2,054)\n-\n(2,054)\n(1,127)\n-\n(1,127)\nTax benefit from operating results\n(767)\n-\n(767)\n(3,879)\n(495)\n(4,374)\n(1,893)\n372\n(1,521)\nEquity-based compensation expense\n3,481\n-\n3,481\n2,933\n423\n3,356\n2,730\n352\n3,082\nAdjusted Operating FFO available to common shareholders & OP unit holders*\n$\n33,413\n$\n4,054\n$\n37,467\n$\n34,768\n$\n6,406\n$\n41,174\n$\n29,084\n$\n7,216\n$\n36,300\n*\nThe Company's calculations of Operating FFO and Adjusted Operating FFO may not be comparable to Operating FFO and Adjusted Operating FFO as calculated by other REITs that do not use the same definition.\nReconciliations of Net Income to EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDA\nThe Company considers earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for real estate (\"EBITDAre\"), to be a supplemental measure of its performance which should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, net income (loss) and cash provided by operating activities as a measure of operating performance. The Company calculates EBITDAre in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"). EBITDAre represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), adjusted to exclude gains (or losses) from sales of depreciated property, income tax expense (or benefit), interest expense, depreciation and amortization, impairments of depreciated property and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, and similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The Company's management uses EBITDAre as a supplemental performance measure because it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures the performance of the Company's operations by removing the impact of capital structure (primarily interest expense) and asset base charges (primarily depreciation and amortization), from its operating results.\nDue to the volatility and nature of certain significant charges and gains recorded in the Company's operating results that management believes are not reflective of its operating performance, management computes an adjusted measure of EBITDAre, which the Company refers to as Adjusted EBITDA. The Company generally calculates Adjusted EBITDA excluding certain non-routine charges write off of unamortized deferred financing costs, gains (losses) on extinguishment of debt, transaction and integration costs, in addition to non-cash recurring costs such as equity-based compensation. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with another financial measure that may facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and, to the extent other REITs calculate Adjusted EBITDA on a comparable basis, between REITs.\nManagement uses EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures as they provide useful measures of assessing the Company's operating results. Other companies may not calculate EBITDAre or Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner. Accordingly, the Company's EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to others. EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as supplements to net income (loss) as measures of the Company's performance and should not be used as substitutes for net income (loss), as measures of its results of operations or liquidity or as an indications of funds available to meet its cash needs, including its ability to make distributions to its stockholders.\nA reconciliation of net income to EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDA on a Core and Non-Core basis is presented below (unaudited and in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nMarch 31, 2017\nCore\nNon-Core\nTotal\nCore\nNon-Core\nTotal\nCore\nNon-Core\nTotal\nEBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDA\nNet income (loss)\n$\n5,083\n$\n(5,335)\n$\n(252)\n$\n(11,011)\n$\n(5,102)\n$\n(16,113)\n$\n1,621\n$\n3,947\n$\n5,568\nInterest income\n(1)\n-\n(1)\n(1)\n-\n(1)\n(1)\n-\n(1)\nInterest expense\n8,103\n7\n8,110\n8,049\n-\n8,049\n6,869\n-\n6,869\nTax benefit of taxable REIT subsidiaries\n(767)\n(1,635)\n(2,402)\n(3,879)\n(495)\n(4,374)\n(1,893)\n372\n(1,521)\nDepreciation and amortization\n33,340\n2,574\n35,914\n34,247\n2,893\n37,140\n30,982\n2,965\n33,947\nImpairment write-downs of depreciated property\n-\n4,017\n4,017\n-\n4,219\n4,219\n-\n-\n-\nEBITDAre\n$\n45,758\n$\n(372)\n$\n45,386\n$\n27,405\n$\n1,515\n$\n28,920\n$\n37,578\n$\n7,284\n$\n44,862\nDebt restructuring costs\n-\n-\n-\n19,992\n-\n19,992\n-\n-\n-\nEquity-based compensation expense\n3,481\n-\n3,481\n2,933\n423\n3,356\n2,730\n352\n3,082\nRestructuring costs\n-\n4,513\n4,513\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTransaction, integration and restructuring costs\n920\n-\n920\n303\n4,927\n5,230\n336\n-\n336\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n50,159\n$\n4,141\n$\n54,300\n$\n50,633\n$\n6,865\n$\n57,498\n$\n40,644\n$\n7,636\n$\n48,280\nReconciliations of Net Income to Net Operating Income (NOI) and Core NOI\nThe Company calculates net operating income (\"NOI\") as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding: interest expense, interest income, tax expense (benefit) of taxable REIT subsidiaries, depreciation and amortization, write off of unamortized deferred financing costs, gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, transaction and integration costs, gain (loss) on sale of real estate, restructuring costs and general and administrative expenses. Management uses NOI as a supplemental performance measure because it provides a useful measure of the operating results from its customer leases. In addition, management believes it is useful to investors in evaluating and comparing the operating performance of its properties and to compute the fair value of its properties. The Company's NOI may not be comparable to other REITs' NOI as other REITs may not calculate NOI in the same manner. NOI should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of the Company's performance and should not be used as a measure of results of operations or liquidity or as an indication of funds available to meet cash needs, including the ability to make distributions to stockholders. NOI is a measure of the operating performance of the Company's properties and not of the Company's performance as a whole. Core NOI represents NOI of the Company's core business and is used as a supplemental performance measure because it reflects results of the portion of the business the Company expects to retain following completion of the strategic growth plan. NOI and Core NOI are therefore not substitutes for net income as computed in accordance with GAAP.\nA reconciliation of net income to NOI and Core NOI is presented below (unaudited and in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nMarch 31, 2017\nCore\nNon-Core\nTotal\nCore\nNon-Core\nTotal\nCore\nNon-Core\nTotal\nNet Operating Income (NOI)\nNet income (loss)\n$\n5,083\n$\n(5,335)\n$\n(252)\n$\n(11,011)\n$\n(5,102)\n$\n(16,113)\n$\n1,621\n$\n3,947\n$\n5,568\nInterest income\n(1)\n-\n(1)\n(1)\n-\n(1)\n(1)\n-\n(1)\nInterest expense\n8,103\n7\n8,110\n8,049\n-\n8,049\n6,869\n-\n6,869\nDepreciation and amortization\n33,340\n2,574\n35,914\n34,247\n2,893\n37,140\n30,982\n2,965\n33,947\nDebt restructuring costs\n-\n-\n-\n19,992\n-\n19,992\n-\n-\n-\nTax benefit of taxable REIT subsidiaries\n(767)\n(1,635)\n(2,402)\n(3,879)\n(495)\n(4,374)\n(1,893)\n372\n(1,521)\nTransaction, integration and impairment costs\n920\n-\n920\n303\n9,146\n9,449\n336\n-\n336\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n18,114\n4,119\n22,233\n16,763\n4,057\n20,820\n17,317\n4,881\n22,198\nRestructuring\n-\n8,530\n8,530\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nNOI (1)\n$\n64,792\n$\n8,260\n$\n73,052\n$\n64,463\n$\n10,499\n$\n74,962\n$\n55,231\n$\n12,165\n$\n67,396\n(1)\nIncludes facility level G&A expense allocation charges of 4% of cash revenue for all facilities, with the exception of the leased facilities acquired in 2015, which include G&A expense allocation charges of 10% of cash revenue.

MRR does not include the impact from booked-not-billed leases as of a particular date, unless otherwise specifically noted.\nSeparately, the Company calculates recognized MRR as the recurring revenue recognized during a given period, which includes revenue from its rental and cloud and managed services activities, but excludes customer recoveries, deferred set up fees, variable related revenues, non-cash revenues and other one-time revenues.\nManagement uses MRR, recognized MRR and Core MRR as supplemental performance measures because they provide useful measures of increases in contractual revenue from the Company's customer leases and customer leases attributable to the Company's core business. MRR, recognized MRR and Core MRR should not be viewed by investors as alternatives to actual monthly revenue, as determined in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may not calculate MRR, recognized MRR or Core MRR in the same manner. Accordingly, the Company's MRR, recognized MRR and Core MRR may not be comparable to other companies' MRR, recognized MRR and Core MRR. MRR, recognized MRR and Core MRR should be considered only as supplements to total revenues as a measure of its performance. MRR, recognized MRR and Core MRR should not be used as measures of the Company's results of operations or liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to meet its cash needs, including its ability to make distributions to its stockholders.\nA reconciliation of total revenues to recognized MRR in the period and MRR and Core MRR at period-end on a Core and Non-Core basis is presented below (unaudited and in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nMarch 31, 2017\nCore\nNon-Core\nTotal\nCore\nNon-Core\nTotal\nCore\nNon-Core\nTotal\nRecognized MRR in the period\nTotal period revenues\n$\n100,390\n$\n13,307\n$\n113,697\n$\n100,617\n$\n18,294\n$\n118,911\n$\n86,876\n$\n19,088\n$\n105,964\nLess: Total period recoveries\n(11,513)\n-\n(11,513)\n(11,052)\n-\n(11,052)\n(8,360)\n-\n(8,360)\nTotal period deferred setup fees\n(2,888)\n(5)\n(2,893)\n(2,979)\n-\n(2,979)\n(2,616)\n-\n(2,616)\nTotal period straight line rent and other\n(3,899)\n(552)\n(4,451)\n(7,287)\n(2,156)\n(9,443)\n(2,086)\n(1,033)\n(3,119)\nRecognized MRR in the period\n82,090\n12,750\n94,840\n79,299\n16,138\n95,437\n73,814\n18,055\n91,869\nMRR at period end\nTotal period revenues\n$\n100,390\n$\n13,307\n$\n113,697\n$\n100,617\n$\n18,294\n$\n118,911\n$\n86,876\n$\n19,088\n$\n105,964\nLess: Total revenues excluding last month\n(66,790)\n(8,871)\n(75,661)\n(66,550)\n(12,196)\n(78,746)\n(58,214)\n(12,725)\n(70,939)\nTotal revenues for last month of period\n33,600\n4,436\n38,036\n34,067\n6,098\n40,165\n28,662\n6,363\n35,025\nLess: Last month recoveries\n(3,107)\n-\n(3,107)\n(3,175)\n-\n(3,175)\n(2,760)\n-\n(2,760)\nLast month deferred setup fees\n(962)\n(2)\n(964)\n(1,123)\n-\n(1,123)\n(898)\n-\n(898)\nLast month straight line rent and other\n(1,669)\n(382)\n(2,051)\n(2,594)\n(1,565)\n(4,159)\n357\n(1,290)\n(933)\nMRR at period end\n$\n27,862\n$\n4,052\n$\n31,914\n$\n27,175\n$\n4,533\n$\n31,708\n$\n25,361\n$\n5,073\n$\n30,434\nNon-Core Reconciliations\nIn conjunction with its previously announced strategic growth plan, QTS is realigning its product offerings around Hyperscale and Hybrid Colocation, while exiting certain of its C3-Cloud and Managed Services offerings, as well as colocation revenue attached to certain customers in the Cloud and Managed Services business that we expect will not remain with QTS post transition (collectively \"Non-Core\" operations). QTS has realigned information included in this release to focus its guidance and key performance metrics around its Core business, which primarily consists of its Hyperscale and Hybrid Colocation businesses, along with technology and services from its Cloud and Managed Services business that support Hyperscale and Hybrid Colocation customers, which together will be the Company's primary business following the completion of the strategic growth plan.\nThe table below includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, separated on a Core / Non-Core basis, which management believes is helpful to understanding the financial results of the Company's Core business.\nIn order to bifurcate revenues and costs the Company utilized the following methodology: For managed service revenue, QTS identified the specific products that it expects to divest of in 2018, and allocated their specific revenue to Non-Core operations. For customers that had Non-Core managed service revenue and also had colocation revenue, the Company performed an analysis on a customer-by-customer basis to determine the portion of colocation revenue considered to be Non-Core.\nFor operating costs, the Company identified costs such as rent expense, software licenses, communications expenses and repairs and maintenance costs associated with servicing the aforementioned Non-Core revenue and classified those costs as Non-Core.\nFor general and administrative costs, certain personnel costs, including severance benefits and equity-based compensation, that were associated with personnel impacted by the strategic growth plan have been reclassified in the first quarter of 2018 to restructuring costs. For current and prior periods Non-Core personnel costs associated with wages and salaries were not reclassified to restructuring cost but are shown in their respective line items as Non-Core. QTS identified the software costs, communications expense and other similar general and administrative costs that are utilized to support the aforementioned revenue and reclassified those costs to Non-Core accordingly.\nDepreciation associated with equipment was identified that services the impacted customers and that QTS expects to dispose of in a transaction has been reclassified accordingly to Non-Core costs. Equipment or other capitalized costs that QTS has abandoned have been reclassified to restructuring costs.\nBelow is selected financial data depicting Core and Non-Core reconciliations (unaudited and in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nThree Months Ended\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nMarch 31, 2017\nSelected Income Statement Data\nCore\nNon-Core\nTotal\nCore\nNon-Core\nTotal\nCore\nNon-Core\nTotal\nTotal Revenues\n$\n100,390\n$\n13,307\n$\n113,697\n$\n100,617\n$\n18,294\n$\n118,911\n$\n86,876\n$\n19,088\n$\n105,964\nLess: Operating costs (1)\n35,598\n5,047\n40,645\n36,154\n7,795\n43,949\n31,645\n6,923\n38,568\nNet operating income\n64,792\n8,260\n73,052\n64,463\n10,499\n74,962\n55,231\n12,165\n67,396\nLess: General & administrative expenses (excluding equity-based compensation expense)\n14,633\n4,119\n18,752\n13,830\n3,634\n17,464\n14,587\n4,529\n19,116\nAdjusted EBITDA\n50,159\n4,141\n54,300\n50,633\n6,865\n57,498\n40,644\n7,636\n48,280\nLess:\nEquity-based compensation expense\n3,481\n—\n3,481\n2,933\n423\n3,356\n2,730\n352\n3,082\nInterest income\n(1)\n—\n(1)\n(1)\n—\n(1)\n(1)\n—\n(1)\nInterest expense\n8,103\n7\n8,110\n8,049\n—\n8,049\n6,869\n—\n6,869\nTax benefit from operating results\n(767)\n—\n(767)\n(3,879)\n(495)\n(4,374)\n(1,893)\n372\n(1,521)\nNon real estate depreciation and amortization\n2,148\n1,709\n3,857\n2,571\n2,030\n4,601\n2,285\n2,158\n4,443\nPreferred stock dividends\n328\n—\n328\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\nOperating FFO available to common shareholders & OP unit holders\n36,867\n2,425\n39,292\n40,960\n4,907\n45,867\n30,654\n4,754\n35,408\nOFFO per share\n0.64\n0.04\n0.68\n0.71\n0.08\n0.79\n0.55\n0.09\n0.64\nAdjustments:\nTransaction, integration and impairment costs\n(920)\n—\n(920)\n(303)\n(9,146)\n(9,449)\n(336)\n—\n(336)\nRestructuring costs\n—\n(8,530)\n(8,530)\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\nDebt restructuring costs\n—\n—\n—\n(19,992)\n—\n(19,992)\n—\n—\n—\nTax benefit associated with restructuring, transaction and integration costs\n—\n1,635\n1,635\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\nReal estate depreciation and amortization\n(31,192)\n(865)\n(32,057)\n(31,676)\n(863)\n(32,539)\n(28,697)\n(807)\n(29,504)\nPreferred stock dividends\n328\n—\n328\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\nNet income (loss)\n$\n5,083\n$\n(5,335)\n$\n(252)\n$\n(11,011)\n$\n(5,102)\n$\n(16,113)\n$\n1,621\n$\n3,947\n$\n5,568\n(1)\nConsists of property operating costs as well as real estate taxes and insurance.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/qts-reports-first-quarter-2018-operating-results-300636231.html\nSOURCE QTS Realty Trust, Inc.",
