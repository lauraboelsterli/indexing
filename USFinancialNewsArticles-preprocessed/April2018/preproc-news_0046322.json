    "text": "PEMBROKE, Bermuda, April 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sompo International Holdings Ltd. (SIH), a Bermuda based specialty provider of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance, announced today that Mr. John (Jack) Kuhn has assumed the new role of Chief Underwriting Officer for Sompo International’s Property & Casualty (P&C) business in addition to his current role as Chief Executive Officer, Global Insurance. In this new role, Mr. Kuhn will provide leadership across the company’s insurance and reinsurance underwriting operations as Sompo International continues to build the overseas platform of its parent company, Sompo Holdings Inc. Mr. Stephen Young, Chief Executive Officer, Global Reinsurance, will report to Mr. Kuhn and will continue as a member of Sompo International’s P&C Executive Team.\nMr. John Charman, CEO of Sompo International, commented, “With the significant expansion of our Commercial P&C business, we need to leverage the considerable talent and expertise within our organization and evolve our leadership structure to support our strategic vision. With a demonstrated track record of transforming our insurance business, I have every confidence that Jack will successfully guide us to considerable future growth across both our insurance and reinsurance platforms.\n“I have had the pleasure of working closely with Stephen over the last few years as he has led the transformation of our global reinsurance portfolio. I am confident that he will continue to provide excellent strategic direction and technical expertise, as we continue to develop our specialty reinsurance capabilities and extend our global reach.”\nMr. Kuhn commented, “I am very excited at the opportunity to take on broader responsibilities across both our insurance and reinsurance segments as we build Sompo International into a truly global integrated platform. We have very strong management teams across both segments and I look forward to working with them as we further enhance our underwriting capabilities.”\nMr. Kuhn joined Endurance Specialty Holdings Ltd., the predecessor company to Sompo International Holdings Ltd., in November 2012 from AXIS Capital, where his most recent role was Chief Underwriting Officer, Axis Insurance.
