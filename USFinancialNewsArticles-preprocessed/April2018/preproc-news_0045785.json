    "text": "Annual Awards Recognize 100 Most Influential Women in the Region\nSANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Centrify , a leading provider of Zero Trust Security through the power of Next-Gen Access, today announced that Rashmi Garde, the company’s general counsel, has been recognized by the Silicon Valley Business Journal as one of the most influential women in the region in 2018. The annual list spotlights the 100 most influential women in Silicon Valley from the public, private and nonprofit sectors.\n“It is an honor to be recognized along with some of the brightest and most influential women in Silicon Valley,” said Garde. “Cybersecurity is a dynamic industry under constant adaptation and evolution, and it impacts everyone whether through imperceptible backend technology or high-profile privacy initiatives like GDPR. I hope my influence in this industry will encourage more women to choose a career path at high-tech companies.”\nAs general counsel at Centrify, Garde oversees the company’s worldwide legal affairs, including corporate governance, intellectual property, data protection, transactions, litigation management, international, employment and real estate.\nPrior to Centrify, Garde held legal positions at public and privately-held companies including BloomReach, Marin Software and VMware. At each company, she joined as the first legal counsel and built out the legal department. She also helped take Marin Software and VMware public.\nIn addition to her professional achievements, Garde is as an active member of the community, and participates in many non-profit and pro bono activities. She supports the groundbreaking program put on by Skadden called “Know Your Rights and Know the Law: Sexual and Social Media Misconduct” that brings attorneys into classrooms throughout the Bay Area to educate students about understanding their rights and the consequences of their actions in the digital media age. She is also involved in local organizations focused on women in the law, including a Women’s General Counsel Network.\nAbout Centrify\nCentrify delivers Zero Trust Security through the power of Next-Gen Access.
