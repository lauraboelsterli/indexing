    "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission criticized on Thursday an incident in Serbia, a candidate for EU membership, when an ultranationalist lawmaker trampled on the Croatian flag in the country’s parliament.\nThe incident prompted a delegation from neighboring Croatia, a European Union member since 2013, to cut short on Wednesday a visit to Serbia which was supposed to be part of an effort to improve relations.\n“What we saw yesterday does not belong to a democratic institution,” a Commission spokesman said. “It is actually disrespectful of a democratic institution representing citizens and all of those who work on good neighborly relations and regional cooperation.”\nThe European Commission is pushing for the EU to expand into the Western Balkans, a region still scarred by the legacy of ethnic wars fought in the 1990s as Yugoslavia broke up.\nRelations between Belgrade and Zagreb have been sour since Croatia fought a war of independence with Serb-controlled Yugoslav forces in which around 20,000 people were killed.\nHead of the Serbian Radical Party Vojislav Seselj grabbed the flag in a hall outside the parliamentary chamber in Belgrade, threw it on the floor, stamped on it and tried to tear it up while hurling insults, witnesses said. The Croatian delegates looked on.\nSerbia is seen as the first of six Western Balkan hopeful countries to join the bloc.\nReporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek; editing by David Stamp\n ",
