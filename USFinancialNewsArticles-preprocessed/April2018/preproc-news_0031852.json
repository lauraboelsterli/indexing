    "text": "RIDGEFIELD, Conn., April 17, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Boehringer Ingelheim today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided full approval for Praxbind® (idarucizumab), the specific reversal agent for Pradaxa® (dabigatran etexilate mesylate). Praxbind is indicated for patients treated with Pradaxa when reversal of the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran is needed for emergency surgery/urgent procedures or in life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding.\n\"In the rare event of an emergency situation requiring reversal, treatment decisions must be made quickly and confidently,\" said Thomas Seck, M.D., vice president, Clinical Development and Medical Affairs, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. \"We believe that the wide availability of Praxbind—and the robust data on its use—can provide patients and healthcare providers with greater assurance in their anticoagulation treatment decisions.\"\nThe FDA granted accelerated approval to Praxbind in October 2015, with continued approval contingent upon results from the phase III RE-VERSE AD™ trial, the largest study to investigate a reversal agent for a NOAC. The final results of RE-VERSE AD were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in July 2017, and showed that Praxbind immediately reversed the anticoagulant effect of Pradaxa. The majority of patients had complete reversal of anticoagulation within four hours as measured by ecarin clotting time (ECT 82%) or diluted thrombin time (dTT 99%).\nIn the RE-VERSE AD study, no adverse safety signals were observed and there was a low rate of thrombotic events. In clinical studies, Praxbind has not shown a procoagulant effect. Healthcare providers should consider resuming anticoagulant therapy as soon as medically appropriate due to the risk of thrombosis associated with patients' underlying conditions.\nPraxbind is stocked in more than 3,000 hospitals in all 50 states nationwide. Healthcare providers and patients can quickly search for institutions in the U.S. where Praxbind is stocked by using a zip code locator tool available at Praxbind.com .\nPraxbind is distributed by U.S. hospital pharmacy distributors ASD, Cardinal Health, MPB, HD Smith and Morris Dickson. Orders can generally be filled or restocked within 24 hours. Additional information about stocking Praxbind, as well as the zip code locator tool, is available at Praxbind.com or by calling 1‑800‑542‑6257 (Opt 1).\nAbout RE-VERSE AD™\nRE-VERSE AD ( NCT02104947 ) is a phase III global study of patients taking dabigatran who require urgent procedures or have uncontrolled bleeding. The final analysis from RE-VERSE AD included data from patients requiring urgent procedures/emergency surgery, e.g. surgery for an open fracture after a fall, or patients with either uncontrolled or life-threatening bleeding complications, e.g. intracranial hemorrhage or severe trauma after a car accident. The primary endpoint, the degree of reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran (Pradaxa) achieved by idarucizumab within four hours, was measured by dTT and ECT.\nThe study, which began in May 2014, is the largest study to investigate a reversal agent for a novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC) in real-world emergency settings. It enrolled a total of 503 patients at 173 sites in 39 countries, which were included in one of two groups:\nGroup A: 301 patients (60 percent) presenting with uncontrolled or life-threatening bleeding (e.g. gastrointestinal [GI] and intracranial [ICH] bleeds) Group B: 202 patients (40 percent) requiring an invasive procedure or an emergency surgery or intervention (e.g. because of a hip fracture)\nAbout Praxbind® (idarucizumab)\nINDICATIONS AND USAGE\nPraxbind® (idarucizumab) is indicated in patients treated with Pradaxa® when reversal of the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran is needed:\nFor emergency surgery/urgent procedures In life‐threatening or uncontrolled bleeding\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION ABOUT PRAXBIND\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\nThromboembolic Risk\nDabigatran-treated patients have underlying diseases predisposing them to thromboembolic events. Reversing dabigatran therapy exposes patients to thrombotic risk. Consider resumption of anticoagulant therapy as soon as medically appropriate.\nRe-elevation of Coagulation Parameters\nElevated coagulation parameters (eg, activated partial thromboplastin time or ecarin clotting time) have been observed in a limited number of PRAXBIND-treated patients. If reappearance of clinically relevant bleeding together with elevated coagulation parameters is observed, or if patients requiring a second emergency surgery/urgent procedure have elevated coagulation parameters, an additional full dose may be considered.\nHypersensitivity Reactions\nThere is insufficient clinical experience evaluating risk of hypersensitivity to idarucizumab, but a possible relationship could not be excluded. Risk of hypersensitivity (eg, anaphylactoid reaction) to idarucizumab or excipients needs to be weighed cautiously against the potential benefit. If serious allergic reaction occurs, immediately discontinue PRAXBIND and institute appropriate treatment.\nRisk in Patients With Hereditary Fructose Intolerance\nPRAXBIND contains 4 g sorbitol as an excipient. When prescribing PRAXBIND in patients with hereditary fructose intolerance, consider the total daily amount of sorbitol/fructose consumption from all sources, as serious adverse reactions (eg, hypoglycemia, hypophosphatemia, metabolic acidosis, increase in uric acid, acute liver failure, and death) may occur.\nADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe most frequently reported adverse reaction in ≥5% of idarucizumab-treated healthy volunteers was headache (5%). The most frequently reported adverse reactions in ≥5% of patients were constipation (7%) and nausea (5%). Treatment-emergent antibodies with low titers were observed in 4% of healthy subjects and 2% of patients treated with idarucizumab.\nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\nPregnancy and Lactation\nPRAXBIND should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Caution should be exercised when PRAXBIND is administered to a nursing woman.\nAbout Pradaxa® (dabigatran etexilate mesylate)\nIndications and Usage\nPradaxa® (dabigatran etexilate mesylate) capsules is indicated:\nto reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION ABOUT PRADAXA\nWARNING: (A) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF PRADAXA INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS, (B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA\n(A) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF PRADAXA INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS\nPremature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including P radaxa , increases the risk of thrombotic events. If anticoagulation with P radaxa is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant\n(B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA\nEpidural or spinal hematomas may occur in patients treated with P radaxa who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures. Factors that can increase the risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas in these patients include:\nuse of indwelling epidural catheters concomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), platelet inhibitors, other anticoagulants a history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures a history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery optimal timing between the administration of P radaxa and neuraxial procedures is not known\nMonitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment. If neurological compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary. Consider the benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients who are or will be anticoagulated.\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\nPradaxa is contraindicated in patients with:\n- active pathological bleeding;\n- known serious hypersensitivity reaction (e.g., anaphylactic reaction or anaphylactic shock) to Pradaxa;\n- mechanical prosthetic heart valve\nWARNINGS & PRECAUTIONS\nIncreased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature Discontinuation\nPremature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including Pradaxa, in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. If Pradaxa is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant and restart Pradaxa as soon as medically appropriate.\nRisk of Bleeding\nPradaxa increases the risk of bleeding and can cause significant and, sometimes, fatal bleeding. Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss (e.g., a drop in hemoglobin and/or hematocrit or hypotension). Discontinue Pradaxa in patients with active pathological bleeding. Risk factors for bleeding include concomitant use of medications that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anti-platelet agents, heparin, fibrinolytic therapy, and chronic use of NSAIDs). Pradaxa's anticoagulant activity and half-life are increased in patients with renal impairment. Reversal of Anticoagulant Effect: A specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) for dabigatran is available when reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is needed: For emergency surgery/urgent procedures In life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding\nHemodialysis can remove dabigatran; however clinical experience for hemodialysis as a treatment for bleeding is limited. Prothrombin complex concentrates or recombinant Factor VIIa may be considered but their use has not been evaluated. Protamine sulfate and vitamin K are not expected to affect dabigatran anticoagulant activity. Consider administration of platelet concentrates where thrombocytopenia is present or long-acting antiplatelet drugs have been used.\nThromboembolic and Bleeding Events in Patients with Prosthetic Heart Valves\nThe use of Pradaxa is contraindicated in patients with mechanical prosthetic valves due to a higher risk for thromboembolic events, especially in the post-operative period, and an excess of major bleeding for Pradaxa vs. warfarin. Use of Pradaxa for the prophylaxis of thromboembolic events in patients with AFib in the setting of other forms of valvular heart disease, including bioprosthetic heart valve, has not been studied and is not recommended.\nEffect of P-gp Inducers & Inhibitors on Dabigatran Exposure\nConcomitant use of Pradaxa with P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampin) reduces exposure to dabigatran and should generally be avoided. P-gp inhibition and impaired renal function are major independent factors in increased exposure to dabigatran. Concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors in patients with renal impairment is expected to increase exposure of dabigatran compared to either factor alone.\nReduction of Risk of Stroke/Systemic Embolism in NVAF\nFor patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30-50 mL/min), reduce the dose of Pradaxa to 75 mg twice daily when dronedarone or systemic ketoconazole is coadministered with Pradaxa. For patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl 15-30 mL/min), avoid concomitant use of Pradaxa and P-gp inhibitors.\nADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe most serious adverse reactions reported with Pradaxa were related to bleeding.\nMost frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of Pradaxa were bleeding & gastrointestinal (GI) events. Pradaxa 150 mg resulted in higher rates of major and any GI bleeds compared to warfarin. In patients ≥75 years of age, the risk of major bleeding may be greater with Pradaxa vs warfarin. Patients on Pradaxa 150 mg had an increased incidence of GI adverse reactions. These were commonly dyspepsia (including abdominal pain upper, abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, and epigastric discomfort) and gastritis-like symptoms (including GERD, esophagitis, erosive gastritis, gastric hemorrhage, hemorrhagic gastritis, hemorrhagic erosive gastritis, and GI ulcer)\nOther Measures Evaluated\nIn NVAF patients, a higher rate of clinical MI was reported in patients who received Pradaxa (0.7/100 patient-years for 150 mg dose) than in those who received warfarin (0.6).\nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\nPregnancy: The limited available data on PRADAXA use in pregnant women are insufficient to determine drug-associated risks for adverse developmental outcomes.\nLactation: Breastfeeding is not recommended.\nGeriatric: Risk of bleeding increases with age.\nPlease see full Prescribing Information , including boxed WARNING and Medication Guide .\nAbout Boehringer Ingelheim\nBoehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., based in Ridgefield, CT, is the largest U.S. subsidiary of Boehringer Ingelheim Corporation.\nBoehringer Ingelheim is one of the world's top 20 pharmaceutical companies.
