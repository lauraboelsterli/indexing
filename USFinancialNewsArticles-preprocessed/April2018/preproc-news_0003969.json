    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said on Monday he did not see the United States and China responding to each other’s tariff moves in a tit-for-tat escalation of trade tensions.\nAsked on CNBC television what the U.S. response should be to about China’s tariffs on $3 billion worth of U.S. fruits, nuts, wine, frozen pork, steel pipe and aluminum scrap, Navarro said: “I don’t think this is going to be an action-response, action-response. That’s not what this should be about, that just leads to escalation spirals.”\nNavarro said President Donald Trump was firmly committed to a course of action that would level the trade playing field between the two countries.\nReporting by David Lawder; Editing by James Dalgleish\n ",
