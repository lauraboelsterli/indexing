Information processing and software servicing fees in our Private Banks segment increased $6.4 million in first-quarter 2018 compared to first-quarter 2017 primarily due to increased assets from new and existing clients processed on the SEI Wealth Platform SM (the Platform). Revenues from the SEI Archway acquisition were $5.5 million during the first-quarter 2018. SEI Archway was acquired during the third-quarter 2017 and is reported in our Investment Managers segment. Our average assets under management, excluding LSV, increased $32.2 billion, or 16 percent, to $233.6 billion, as compared to $201.4 billion during the first-quarter 2017 (see attached Average Asset Balances schedules for further details). Our average assets under administration increased $56.4 billion, or 12 percent, to $530.3 billion in the first-quarter 2018, as compared to $474.0 billion during the first-quarter 2017 (see attached Average Asset Balances schedules for further details). Sales events, net of client losses, during first-quarter 2018 totaled approximately $18.8 million and are expected to generate net annualized recurring revenues of approximately $11.6 million when contract values are fully realized. Our earnings from LSV increased by $7.0 million, or 21 percent, to $40.6 million in first-quarter 2018 as compared to $33.6 million in first-quarter 2017. The increase in earnings was due to an increase in assets under management from market appreciation; however, our earnings were negatively impacted by increased personnel expenses of LSV. Our operating expenses, primarily personnel costs, in our Investment Advisors and Investment Managers segments increased. These expenses primarily consist of operational, technology and marketing costs and are mainly related to servicing existing clients and acquiring new clients. In addition, our Investment Managers segment includes personnel costs related to SEI Archway acquired during the third-quarter 2017. We capitalized $12.9 million and $16.9 million of software development costs in first-quarter 2018 and 2017, respectively, of which $12.0 million and $15.2 million are related to continued enhancements to the Platform. Our expenses related to maintenance and enhancements not eligible for capitalization have increased. A higher portion of these costs are recognized in personnel and consulting costs. These increased costs primarily impacted the Private Banks and Investment Advisors business segments. Amortization expense related to the Platform decreased to $9.7 million during the first-quarter 2018 as compared to $12.0 million during the first-quarter 2017 due to an adjustment to the estimated useful life of the Platform effective in the fourth-quarter 2017. During the first-quarter 2018, we placed into service an application developed for the Investment Managers segment. This new offering includes components that leverage upon the current infrastructure and add significant enhancements designed to aggregate, transact and process data. Amortization expense related to the application was $1.3 million during first-quarter 2018. Our effective tax rate was 11.9 percent in first-quarter 2018 as compared to 31.0 percent in first-quarter 2017. The decline in our tax rate was primarily due to the tax changes enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 and increased tax benefits due to a higher volume of stock option exercise activity. We adopted ASU Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09) on January 1, 2018. With our adoption of ASU 2014-09, fees received for research services provided by our brokerage subsidiary, SIDCO, are now recorded net of amounts paid for the soft dollar arrangement. As a result, our revenues and expenses in first-quarter 2018 were each reduced by $3.7 million with no impact to net income. Refer to our first-quarter 2018 Form 10-Q for information regarding the impact of ASU 2014-09 on our financial statements. We repurchased 1.1 million shares of our common stock for $82.3 million during the first-quarter 2018.\nEarnings Conference Call\nA conference call to review earnings is scheduled for 4:30 p.m. Eastern time on Apr. 25, 2018.
