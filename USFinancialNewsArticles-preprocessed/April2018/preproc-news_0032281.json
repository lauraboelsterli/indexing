    "text": "SAO PAULO, April 17 (Reuters) - Embraer SA on Tuesday named as its new chief financial officer Nelson Salgado, who is currently head of external affairs and corporate communications at the Brazilian planemaker, according to a securities filing.\nSalgado has worked at Embraer for more than three decades, rising through the ranks of engineers to run planning and strategy in recent years. He will take over from José Antonio Filippo, who joined Embraer as CFO in 2012 and is stepping down immediately “to dedicate himself to new professional projects,” according to the filing.
