    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas, April 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jones Energy, Inc. (NYSE:JONE) (“Jones Energy” or “the Company”) today announced that its Board of Directors has declared a contingent quarterly dividend per share equal to 8.0% on an annualized basis based on the liquidation preference of $50.00 per share, or $1.00 per share, on the Company’s 8.0% Series A Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”). If paid, the dividend will be paid using the Company’s Class A common stock. The price per share of the Class A common stock used to determine the number of shares to be issued (the “Dividend Valuation Price”) will be equal to 95% of the average volume-weighted average price per share for each day during the five consecutive day trading period ending immediately prior to the payment date.\nThis contingent dividend is for the period beginning on the last payment date of February 15, 2018 through May 14, 2018 and, subject to the contingency described below, will be payable on May 15, 2018 to shareholders of record as of May 1, 2018.\nThe Company is currently prohibited from paying cash dividends on the Preferred Stock under the terms of its indebtedness. In order for the Company to pay the dividend in full in accordance with the terms of the Preferred Stock, the Dividend Valuation Price must be at or above $0.76 (the “Floor Price”) 1 . If the Dividend Valuation Price is below the Floor Price, the Preferred Stock dividend payable on May 15, 2018 will not be paid by the Company and the right to receive those dividends will accrue for holders of Preferred Stock.\nFuture Preferred Stock dividend payments will be evaluated on a quarterly basis.\nAbout Jones Energy\nJones Energy, Inc. is an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the development and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties in the Anadarko basin of Oklahoma and Texas.
