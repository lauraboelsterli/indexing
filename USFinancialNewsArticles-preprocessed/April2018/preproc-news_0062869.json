    "text": "TULSA, Okla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Alliance Holdings GP, L.P. (NASDAQ: AHGP) today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 (the \"2018 Quarter\"). As previously announced on April 27, 2018, the Board of Directors of its general partner (the \"Board\") approved a distribution to unitholders of $0.7475 per unit (an annualized rate of $2.99 per unit) for the 2018 Quarter, payable on May 18, 2018 to AHGP unitholders of record as of the close of trading on May 11, 2018. The announced distribution represents a 35.9% increase over the cash distribution of $0.55 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 (the \"2017 Quarter\") and a 0.7% increase over the cash distribution of $0.7425 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 (the \"Sequential Quarter\").\nAHGP's principal sources of cash flow are its ownership interests in Alliance Resource Partners, L.P. (NASDAQ: ARLP). The declared distribution is based on the distribution AHGP will receive from its ownership interests in ARLP, which previously announced on April 27, 2018 a quarterly distribution for the 2018 Quarter of $0.515 per unit, or $2.06 per unit on an annualized basis, payable on May 15, 2018 to all unitholders of record as of the close of trading on May 8, 2018.\nAHGP also reported net income attributable to AHGP for the 2018 Quarter of $103.7 million, or $1.73 per basic and diluted limited partner unit, an increase of 88.5% compared to net income attributable to AHGP for the 2017 Quarter of $55.0 million, or $0.92 per basic and diluted limited partner unit. Net income attributable to AHGP for the 2018 Quarter increased approximately 110.4% compared to net income attributable to AHGP for the Sequential Quarter of $49.3 million, or $0.82 per basic and diluted limited partner unit.\nOperating results for AHGP reflect those of the operating subsidiaries of ARLP and, as a result, AHGP reports its financial results on a consolidated basis with the financial results of ARLP. The consolidated net income of AHGP includes earnings and losses attributable to both AHGP and noncontrolling interests.\nOn February 23, 2018 ARLP and AHGP (collectively, the “Alliance Partnerships”) jointly announced an agreement pursuant to which, through a series of transactions (the “Simplification Transactions”), AHGP would become a wholly owned subsidiary of ARLP and all of the ARLP common units held by AHGP and its subsidiaries would be distributed to the unitholders of AHGP in exchange for their AHGP common units. Pursuant to this agreement, ARLP filed a preliminary registration statement on Form S-4 on March 29, 2018. On April 26, 2018, the Securities Exchange Commission declared the Form S-4 effective to register the distribution of the ARLP common units currently held by AHGP and its subsidiaries to AHGP’s unitholders and, on April 27, 2018, AHGP mailed consent solicitation statements to its unitholders of record as of April 25, 2018. Consummation of the Simplification Transactions remains subject to the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding AHGP common units. Certain AHGP unitholders, which collectively own a majority of the outstanding AHGP common units, have agreed to deliver a written consent approving the Simplification Transactions pursuant to a support agreement. The Alliance Partnerships expect to close the Simplification Transactions during the second quarter of 2018 following AHGP's quarterly cash distribution to unitholders discussed above.\nA joint conference call regarding AHGP and ARLP's 2018 Quarter financial results is scheduled for today at 10:00 a.m. Eastern.
