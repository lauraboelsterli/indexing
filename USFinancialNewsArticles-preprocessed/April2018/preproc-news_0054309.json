    "text": "Sorry Folks, No More Emotional Support Goats on Alaska Airlines Sandy Huffaker—Getty Images By Chris Morris April 25, 2018\nIf you’re planning to take a trip with your emotional support goat, salamander, or hedgehog on Alaska Airlines, you’re going to need to travel by May 1.\nThe airline has updated its policy on emotional support animals, banning amphibians and animals with hooves, tusks, or horns. Not banned? Miniature horses that are “trained to behave appropriately” (presumably that means not kicking the seat in front of them or leaning their seat all the way back for the duration of the flight).\nThe carrier will also require anyone flying with an emotional support animal to provide a signed document from their medical professional along with health and behavior documents for their four-legged friend after Apr. 30.\nAlaska Airlines, which recently completed absorbing the Virgin America brand, isn’t the first to implement stricter requirements for passengers who want to bring an animal on board. Delta changed its policies in January. And United followed suit in February , after a woman tried to board with a peacock .\nCertified service animals, such as seeing-eye dogs, are not affected by the new policy. And emotional support dogs and cats are welcome, as long as they have been properly trained.\nSpiders and snakes, though? That’s a big ol’ nope. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
