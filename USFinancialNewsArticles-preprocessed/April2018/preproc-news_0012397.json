    "text": "TOKYO, April 9 (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Monday the central bank would eventually need to consider how to normalise its ultra-easy monetary policy.\nBut he reiterated that it was too early to debate specific means to whittle down stimulus with inflation distant from the BOJ’s 2 percent target.\n“I think the process of any shift (from easy policy) would be cautious and gradual, as with U.S. and European central banks,” Kuroda told a news conference.
