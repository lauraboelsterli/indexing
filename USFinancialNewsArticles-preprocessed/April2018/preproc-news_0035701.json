Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan speaks during a meeting of his ruling AK Party at the Parliament in Ankara, Turkey April 10, 2018. Murat Cetinmuhurdar/Presidential Palace/Handout via REUTERS ATTENTION EDITORS - THIS PICTURE WAS PROVIDED BY A THIRD PARTY. NO RESALES. NO ARCHIVE. \nErdoganâ€™s comments came after the head of the nationalist MHP party suggested holding presidential elections in August this year. \nTurks narrowly backed a constitutional change last year to change the constitution and grant Erdogan sweeping powers. The changes are due to become effective in the next elections. Reporting by Ercan Gurses; Writing by Ezgi Erkoyun; Editing by David Dolan",
