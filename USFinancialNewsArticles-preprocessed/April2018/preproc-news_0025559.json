    "text": "Getty Images Andrew McCabe \nThe Justice Department’s internal watchdog concluded in a blistering report that former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe misled investigators who were probing his role in providing information in October 2016 to a reporter for The Wall Street Journal. \nThe report, which the inspector general sent to Congress on Friday, says McCabe lacked candor in conversations about the leak with top FBI officials and the bureau’s internal investigators as well as those from the Justice Department’s inspector general. \nThe report, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, sheds new light on the rationale offered for the firing last month of McCabe—a veteran Federal Bureau Investigation agent who lost his job just a day before he was eligible to retire with full benefits. \nHis dismissal drew scrutiny because McCabe was a frequent target of President Donald Trump and other Republicans on Capitol Hill, raising questions about whether there was a political motivation for the dismissal. Trump wrote on Twitter in March that McCabe “knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI.”",
