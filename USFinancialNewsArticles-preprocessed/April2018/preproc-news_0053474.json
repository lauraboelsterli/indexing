    "text": "April 27, 2018 / 4:14 AM / Updated an hour ago Geely's Volvo Cars posts 3.6 percent profit rise in first quarter Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nSTOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Geely-owned automaker Volvo Car Group reported a 3.6 percent rise in quarterly operating earnings on Friday as growing sales in China and a recovery in the U.S. market offset increased development and marketing costs. A Volvo XC 90 car is seen during an interview with CEO Hakan Samuelsson at the Volvo Cars Showroom in Stockholm, Sweden July 5, 2017. TT News Agency/Jonas Ekstromer/via REUTERS\nSwedish Volvo Cars, owned by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, said operating earnings rose to 3.62 billion crowns (299.33 million pounds) in the first quarter of a year it flagged will entail heavy spending on marketing new models and developing technology.\n“Volvo expects profits to remain strong based on an improved model mix,” the company said in its outlook for full-year 2018.\n“Profit is expected to be partly impacted by increased expenses related to continued focus on marketing, R&D and digitalisation,” it added in a statement.\nRevenues at the Gothenburg-based carmaker rose 18.9 percent to 56.81 billion crowns in the quarter.
