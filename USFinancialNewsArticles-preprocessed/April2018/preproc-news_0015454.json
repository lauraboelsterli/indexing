    "text": "April 10, 2018 / 6:03 PM / a few seconds ago Creditors of Croatia's Agrokor agree debt settlement terms Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \nZAGREB (Reuters) - Creditors of indebted Croatian food group Agrokor [AGROK.UL] have agreed draft settlement terms aimed at saving the company from bankruptcy, Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said on Tuesday. Croatia's Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic and Agrokor crisis manager Fabris Perusko attend a news conference in a government building in Zagreb, Croatia, April 10, 2018. REUTERS/Antonio Bronic \nThe creditors, including foreign and local banks, bondholders and suppliers, will vote on the deal before July 10, the legal deadline for avoiding bankruptcy. \n“I am happy to say that a settlement process has been completed,” Plenkovic told reporters after meeting creditors. “We now have three months to finalize the text of the settlement.” \nAgrokor, the biggest employer in the Balkans, was put under state-run administration a year ago after an overly-ambitious expansion drive left it weighed down by borrowings.. \nRussia’s Sberbank ( SBER.MM ) is Agrokor’s single biggest creditor with a 1.1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) claim. Overall debt claims against the company amount to 58 billion kuna ($9.7 billion).
