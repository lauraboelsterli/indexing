    "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont has paid bail and may immediately leave the prison in the German town of Neumuenster where he has been held since last month, the state prosecutor in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein said.\nThe former Catalan leader was arrested last month on a Spanish-issued arrest warrant as he entered Germany.\nA court in Schleswig-Holstein on Thursday agreed to release Puigdemont on bail and said extradition to Spain was possible on a charge of misuse of public funds, but not the charge of rebellion for his role in the campaign for Cataloniaâ€™s independence.\nReporting by Hans-Edzard Busemann; Writing by Paul Carrel, editing by Thomas Escritt\n ",
