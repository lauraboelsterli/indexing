    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s Prince Harry and his American fiancee Meghan Markle will attend a memorial service next week for Stephen Lawrence, a London teenager who was murdered in a racially motivated attack 25 years ago, Kensington Palace said on Tuesday.\nBritain's Prince Harry, Patron of the Invictus Games Foundation, and Meghan Markle watch athletes at the team trials for the Invictus Games Sydney 2018 at the University of Bath Sports Training Village in Bath, Britain, April 6, 2018. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls Harry, who will marry Markle at Windsor on May 19, will read a message of support from his father, Prince Charles, the palace said on Twitter.\nThe service will take place on Monday 23 April at St Martin-in-the-Fields church in London.\nLawrence’s murder, an unprovoked attack by a gang of white youths as the 18-year-old waited at a bus stop, shocked Britain and exposed racism in its police force.\nTwo of the killers were found guilty almost 10 years after his death following years of campaigning by his parents to bring them to justice.\nWriting by Elisabeth O'Leary; editing by Stephen Addison\n ",
