    "text": "EditorsNote: Fixes typo (“eighth save” in fourth graf)\nNew York’s Robert Gsellman pitched two innings of scoreless relief and scored the winning run in the 12th inning to give the Mets a 5-3 win over the Atlanta Braves at SunTrust Park.\nGsellman, who batted for himself in the 12th, was hit by a pitch by Atlanta reliever Josh Ravin. He advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt and scored on a single by Yoenis Cespedes. Gsellman slid in ahead of the throw from right fielder Nick Markakis.\nThe Mets added an insurance run when Asdrubel Cabrera doubled to right to drive in Cespedes.\nNew York closer Jeurys Familia pitched a scoreless 12th, giving him 11 1/3 consecutive scoreless innings, to earn his eighth save.\nGsellman (2-0) allowed one hit and one walk in two innings, with three strikeouts.\nRavin (0-1) worked two innings and allowed two runs on two hits and one walk, with one strikeout. Ravin had been activated on Friday when the Braves sent Lucas Sims to Triple-A Gwinnett. Ravin had missed 17 games with a viral infection.\nNew York (14-5) is now 2-0 in extra inning games. Atlanta (11-8) is 1-4 in extra innings.\nBoth starting pitchers were effective on Friday, but neither figured in the decision.\nNew York’s Noah Syndergaard allowed three runs in six innings. He allowed seven hits, one a home run, and struck out six.\nAtlanta’s Sean Newcomb also pitched six innings and allowed three runs (two earned) on six hits and three walks. He struck out five.\nThe Braves got on the board in the first inning when Ozzie Albies hit a solo homer, his sixth\nThe Mets took a 2-1 lead in the third inning. Amed Rosario doubled home Tomas Nido and took third on a throwing error by center fielder Ender Inciarte. Rosario scored on Michael Conforto’s sacrifice fly to left field.\nNew York added a run in the fourth when Wilmer Flores singled in Todd Frazier to make it 3-1.\nAtlanta closed the gap to 3-2 in the fourth when Dansby Swanson scored on Ryan Flaherty’s double to right field.\nThe Braves tied it in the sixth when Kurt Suzuki drove home Nick Markakis with a sacrifice fly. Markakis led off the inning with a double and reached third on a wild pitch.\nThe third game of the four-game series will be played on Saturday. New York will send right-hander Jacob deGrom (2-0, 3.24) against Atlanta right-hander Julio Teheran (1-1, 5.40).\n—Field Level Media\n 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
