    "text": "(Reuters) - Laboratory Corp of America Holdings ( LH.N ) posted a quarterly profit on Wednesday that beat analysts’ estimates, helped by higher demand at the unit performing clinical trials for drugmakers, and prompting the company to raise its full-year revenue target.\nThe company’s Covance unit, which has been steadily improving, hit $1 billion in sales for the first time, benefiting from the acquisition of privately held CRO Chiltern International.\nCovance sales rose 39.3 percent to $1.08 billion, better than consensus estimates of $1.02 billion by Evercore ISI.\nLabCorp has been acquiring contract research organizations as drugmakers try to cut costs by outsourcing clinical trials.\n“It is reassuring to see Covance pivot to growth after 1H17 declines, and that the Chiltern integration appears to be going smoothly,” Barclays analysts said in a research note.\nThe company’s shares were up 3.4 percent at $171.79.\nLabCorp is also focusing on expanding partnerships. It has an ongoing collaboration with Walgreens Boots Alliance ( WBA.O ), where it has patient service centers within Walgreens stores.\n“We expect the partnership with Walgreens to expand both in number of stores and scope over the balance of 2018,” Chief Executive Officer David King said on a conference call with analysts.\nRevenue from its diagnostics unit, which offers services such as genetic and pathology tests through labs throughout the United States, rose 8 percent to $1.64 billion in the quarter.\n“In diagnostics, our focus on women’s health and medical drug monitoring as well as our strategic collaboration with 23andMe contributed to organic growth,” King said.\nLabCorp provides its testing services to 23andMe, a Mountain View, California-based genetic testing company.\nThe diagnostics testing company raised its 2018 net revenue growth forecast to 10-12 percent from 9.5-11.5 percent. LabCorp reiterated its earnings forecast of $11.30 to $11.70 per share.\nNet earnings attributable to LabCorp was $173.2 million, or $1.67 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, compared with $183 million, or $1.75 per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding items, the company earned $2.78 per share. Analysts on average had estimated $2.63 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nNet revenue rose 18 percent to $2.85 billion, which also beat analysts’ estimates of $2.77 billion.\nLast week, Quest Diagnostics ( DGX.N ) also reported a better-than-expected first quarter earnings, citing benefits of tax reform.\nReporting by Akankshita Mukhopadhyay and Anuron Kumar Mitra in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva and Shailesh Kuber\n ",
