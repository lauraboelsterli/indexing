    "text": "(Adds guidance, background on takeover battle)\nApril 16 (Reuters) - Swiss construction chemicals group Sika reported first-quarter sales slightly above expectations on Tuesday as it awaits a court verdict in its bitter takeover battle with France’s Saint-Gobain.\nSika, whose products were used to help waterproof the Gotthard railway tunnel under the Alps, said sales rose 11 percent to 1.55 billion Swiss francs ($1.61 billion) in the three months ended March 31. That beat forecasts of 1.54 billion francs in a Reuters poll.\nSales growth in local currencies was 11 percent, as the company benefitted from a string of recent acquisitions and increased activity in the global construction market.\nThe swiss firm set a sales target of 7 billion Swiss francs ($7.29 billion) for 2018.\nFor the year, Sika said its EBIT and net profit should increase at a “disproportionately high rate”.\nThe latest court decision in Sika’s ongoing battle with Saint-Gobain is expected in the next few weeks on Sika’s attempts to thwart the hostile approach by reducing its founding Burkard family’s voting rights to 5 percent.\nSika’s actions were upheld by a court in 2016 but the family has appealed against the decision, which is now being reviewed by a higher court in the Swiss canton of Zug.\nThe Burkard family, whose 16 percent holding came with nearly 53 percent of the voting rights, have been locked in a dispute with Sika’s management for more than three years.\nThe case has been closely observed by investors, who see it as a test case for the rights of minority stakeholders. The takeover has also been opposed by Columbia Threadneedle Investments, Fidelity International and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust.\nSika, whose chemicals are also used in the automotive industry, has opposed the deal saying a tie up with Saint-Gobain did not make industrial sense. The company’s board has said it would also be disadvantaged by being controlled by a direct rival which only owned a minority of the share capital.
