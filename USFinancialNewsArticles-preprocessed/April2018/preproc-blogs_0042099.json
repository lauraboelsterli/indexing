    "text": "8 COMMENTS Photo: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News \nA hardware failure at the Internal Revenue Service on Tuesday that prevented taxpayers from filing online returns highlights the risks for chief information officers struggling with aging backend IT systems, tight budgets and growing pressure to provide innovative front-end services, federal watchdogs and industry analysts say.\n“For the IRS this was a mission-critical system that processes most of our $3.3 trillion in taxes every year,” David A. Powner, director of information technology management issues at the United States Government Accountability office, told CIO Journal.\n“But we still don’t see a definite plan to get it into shape,” he said.\nAccording to Mr. Powner, the agency’s legacy hardware systems are programmed with assembly language, a computer language initially used in the 1950s.\nThis includes the agency’s Individual Master File, or IMF, its main computer system for data on individual taxpayer accounts, he added. It is the computer system underpinning the agency’s modernized e-file system, which taxpayers use to file returns online, he said.\nDespite a slew of federal IT modernization efforts in recent years, agency officials across the federal government tend to shy away from overhauling backend systems that remain operational, Mr. Powner said.\nThat means systems often don’t get the attention they need until they fail, he said.\nMr. Powner said he expects to meet with IRS officials to review the exact cause of this week’s outage in the days ahead.\nThe IRS has blamed the one-day outage on a “hardware issue,” which caused difficulties in receiving online returns from individual filers and large tax preparers, including TurboTax maker Intuit and H&R Block \nTaxpayers were given an extra penalty-free day to file returns.\n“IRS teams worked hard throughout the night” to get the system back online, Acting Commission David Kautter said in a statement Wednesday.\nFor many public-sector IT officials, adequate funding is “clearly an issue,” as budget pressures drive the need for operational cost savings, said Doug Robinson, executive director of the National Association of State CIOs.\n“It’s balancing legacy and innovation, however many of the legacy systems are mission critical and must be replaced,” Mr. Robinson said.\nFederal watchdog groups have been warning about aging IT systems at the IRS for many years.\nDanny Verneuille, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration’s assistant inspector general for audit, told House lawmakers in October that the IRS’s main computer system has been using “outdated” code for more than 50 years.\n“The IRS’s reliance on legacy systems, aged hardware and its use of outdated programming languages pose significant risks to the IRS’s ability to deliver its mission,” Mr. Verneuille told members of the House Ways and Means Committee.\n“Modernizing the IRS’s computer systems has been a persistent challenge for many years and will likely remain a challenge for the foreseeable future,” he said.\nAs one example, he added, the agency has “no current timetable for adoption and implementation of an enterprise-wide cloud strategy.”\nBeyond tech debt, federal agency CIOs tend not to be around long enough to make sweeping changes to IT systems, Mr. Powner said, adding that on average CIOs government-wide serve for just two years.\nBy contrast, he said, It takes roughly a year for an incoming CIO to figure out a large IT system and much of the following year creating an IT modernization plan: “By that point, they’re already gone,” Mr. Powner said.\nHouse lawmakers are hoping to pass a series of bipartisan bills later this week, including one aimed at creating a strategic plan to update IRS technology, according to Rep. Kevin Brady (R., Texas), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.\nShare this: FEDERAL IT INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE LEGACY Previous  : Aging IT Systems Tax the IRS Next  : IRS Systems Contain ‘50s-Era Code, GAO Official Says",
