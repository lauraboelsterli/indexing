Main opposition conservative New Democracy party leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis meets with journalists of the Foreign Press Association of Greece in Athens, Greece, April 12, 2018. REUTERS/Alkis Konstantinidis \nAthens and Skopje are negotiating to settle a dispute that has kept Macedonia from joining NATO and the European Union. Greece believes the name “Macedonia” implies a territorial claim over its northern region, which uses the same name. \n“We will express our strong disagreement in parliament if and when such an accord comes,” New Democracy leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis, whose party leads the country’s leftist-led government in opinion polls, told the foreign press association. \n“A constitutional review (by Skopje) is a necessary precondition for an accord,” he said. Main opposition conservative New Democracy party leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis arrives for a meeting with journalists of the Foreign Press Association of Greece in Athens, Greece, April 12, 2018. REUTERS/Alkis Konstantinidis \nThe changes New Democracy wants would affect passages in the Macedonian constitution that refer to nationality, language and other articles. Macedonia so far has refused to consider any such changes. And in any case the Greek government can pass any agreement without the help of New Democracy. \nHundreds of thousands of Greeks rallied in the northern city of Thessaloniki and in Athens earlier this year to protest against the use of the name “Macedonia” in any solution to the row. \nMitsotakis accused the government of conducting “secret diplomacy” and then briefing political parties in the opposition, saying its tactics are dividing Greeks. \nTalks between the two states have been inconclusive since 1991, when Macedonia withdrew from former Yugoslavia. It was admitted into the United Nations in 1993 under the name Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, sometimes referred to as FYROM.
