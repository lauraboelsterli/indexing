    "text": "EditorsNote: Adds first name for Crawford\nPablo Sandoval took Felix Hernandez’s pitch into the San Francisco Bay for a three-run home run Wednesday afternoon, helping the San Francisco Giants split their interleague series against the Seattle Mariners with a 10-1 romp at AT&T Park.\nRight-hander Johnny Cueto (1-0), benefitting from a three-run first inning and a five-run fifth, coasted to his first win of the season, allowing one run and eight hits in six innings. He walked two and struck out one.\nCueto took a perfect game into the seventh inning of his first start but left a scoreless contest against the Los Angeles Dodgers after seven innings, having allowed one hit. He did not get a decision.\nThe Giants, who had scored six runs in their first five games, got to Hernandez early and often, including a three-run first that featured a bases-loaded walk to Sandoval, a wild pitch that scored a run and a sacrifice fly by Brandon Crawford.\nThen the Giants broke out their power-hitting bats, starting with Gorkys Hernandez’s first homer of the season, a second-inning shot that increased San Francisco’s lead to 4-0.\nThe Giants broke the game open and sent the Mariners’ Hernandez to the showers in their five-run fifth, which was ignited by Brandon Belt’s first homer of the season, a solo shot.\nAfter a pair of walks, Sandoval, making his first start of the season, unloaded on Hernandez into the water beyond the right field wall for an 8-0 lead.\nThe homer was Sandoval’s first of the season and the eighth “Splash Hit” of his career, the second-most in the history of AT&T Park behind Barry Bonds’ 35.\nCrawford then greeted left-hander James Pazos with a home run, also his first of the year, to make it a five-run inning and a 9-0 lead.\nFelix Hernandez (1-1) was roughed up for eight runs on six hits and five walks in four innings. He struck out one in his AT&T Park debut.\nHe had shut out Cleveland for 5 1/3 innings in a 2-1 win in his earlier start.\nThe Mariners avoided a shutout when Daniel Vogelbach doubled home Robinson Cano, who had singled, off Cueto in the sixth.\nGorkys Hernandez and Belt had three hits apiece and Crawford two for the Giants, who out-hit the Mariners 12-10. Sandoval drove in four runs, while Belt and Crawford had two RBIs each.\nVogelbach, Cano and Dee Gordon had two hits each for the Mariners, who fell to 3-2.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
