    "text": "RBS delivers profit beat ahead of impending DOJ fine April 27, 2018\nThe Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) reported better-than-expected figures for its first quarter on Friday.\nThe bank’s attributable profit for the first quarter stood at £792 million ($1.1 billion), compared with £259 million for the prior year period, and was better than the £534 million expected in a Reuters poll.\nIt also saw a 2.8 percent increase in income and a 2.1 percent reduction in costs, excluding litigation and conduct costs. RBS also saw its mobile banking app usage grow by 21 percent from the same period last year.\nBut the positive news is likely to be overshadowed by its ongoing legal case and an impending fine from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) over the bank’s selling of toxic mortgage-backed securities ahead of the 2008 financial crisis. It reached a settlement with the New York Attorney General in March for $500 million.\nThe Edinburgh-headquartered bank came under fire earlier this year after announcing it would close 62 branches across Scotland, and was forced to partially renege on its plans and suspend 10 branch closures in response to public anger.
