Public documents were released today to support those presentations. The documents are available online on both the Veridian and Whitby Hydro ’s merger websites and include:\na summary of the business case for the merger, providing details about share and dividends, electricity rates, governance, and risk/benefit analysis of the merger. a fairness opinion, which is an independent professional opinion that concludes the merger agreement is fair, from a financial perspective, to the municipal shareholders\n“As these documents show, the new company will continue to be 100 per cent municipally owned, with dividends flowing to the municipalities for reinvestment in their communities. The merger is also expected to generate about $90 million in savings over the next 17 years. We’re looking forward to discussing these benefits, among many others, with our shareholders in the coming weeks,” said Adrian Foster, Chair of Veridian’s Board of Directors.\nThe schedule for initial municipal presentations is as follows:\nApril 09, 2018 4:00 p.m. City of Belleville April 10, 2018 7:00 p.m. Town of Whitby April 10, 2018 (tentative, TBC) 7:00 p.m. City of Pickering April 16, 2018 9:30 a.m. Municipality of Clarington April 23, 2018 7:00 p.m. Town of Ajax “The management teams of both companies have jointly identified that a merger will offer greater benefits to customers, communities and shareholders than remaining as standalone utilities, and we encourage our stakeholders to review the information we’ve shared today,” said Patrick McNeil, Chair of Whitby Hydro’s Board of Directors.\nVeridian and Whitby Hydro entered into a Memorandum of Understanding related to the merger on July 17, 2017.
