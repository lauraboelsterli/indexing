UNRWA, the U.N body responsible for Palestinian refugees has called on warring parties to spare civilians.\n“There are some families that have been buried under the rubble and no one is able to retrieve their bodies,” said Abu Osama, a resident who fled the camp two days ago to nearby Yalda, joining thousands of others seeking relative safety there since the start of the latest offensive.
