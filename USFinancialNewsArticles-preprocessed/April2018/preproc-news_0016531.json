    "text": "Jose Pirela produced a multi-hit game, including a decisive two-run double in the fifth inning, and the San Diego Padres claimed a 4-1 interleague win over the host Houston Astros on Friday at Minute Maid Park.\nPirela finished 3-for-5 with two RBIs and a run scored, pacing a tenacious Padres attack. San Diego banged out 13 hits, seven against Houston starter Lance McCullers Jr. (1-1), to snap the Astros’ five-game winning streak. Pirela struck the biggest blow against McCullers when his line drive cleared Astros right fielder Josh Reddick and plated Austin Hedges and Manuel Margot.\nThe Padres recorded five hits in the fifth inning, with Margot following Hedges’ one-out double to left field with a bad-hop infield single. Pirela followed and gave the Padres a 3-1 lead. McCullers allowed two more singles before striking out Hunter Renfroe to finally snuff the rally.\nMcCullers allowed three runs (two earned) on seven hits and three walks with seven strikeouts over five innings. His throwing error in the first inning enabled Pirela to advance from second to third base, with Pirela later scoring on a passed ball by catcher Brian McCann for a 1-0 lead.\nThe Astros pulled even in the third against Padres right-hander Luis Perdomo (1-1), with George Springer reaching on a leadoff single and scoring three batters later when Carlos Correa golfed a sacrifice fly to center. Perdomo was otherwise solid, allowing four hits in five innings.\nThe San Diego bullpen backed up Perdomo by suffocating the Astros lineup. Right-hander Jordan Lyles, who spent three seasons in Houston to open his career, recorded four strikeouts over two perfect frames before righty Kirby Yates struck out the final two batters in the eight.\nPadres southpaw closer Brad Hand notched his second save by working a scoreless ninth.\nEric Hosmer and Christian Villanueva doubled in succession off Astros right-hander Ken Giles in the ninth inning, with Villanueva notching an RBI. Both finished 2-for-4.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
