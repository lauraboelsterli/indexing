FILE PHOTO - A State Department employee adjusts flags before a cancelled bi-lateral photo between U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson at the State Department in Washington, U.S. March 22, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts \nIn a joint statement, the two countries said the working group would be a forum for the two treasury departments and staff at regulatory authorities to exchange views on the future relationship. \nBoth sides said the working group would meet twice a year, with additional technical meetings and calls when needed.
