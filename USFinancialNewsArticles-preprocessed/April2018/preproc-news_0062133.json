Tennis - WTA Premier - Stuttgart Tennis Grand Prix - Porsche-Arena, Stuttgart, Britain - April 29, 2018 Czech Republic's Karolina Pliskova celebrates with the trophy after winning the final against CoCo Vandeweghe of the U.S. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\nThe dominant Czech fifth seed fired 11 aces and wrapped up the match in an hour and 56 minutes to halt Vandeweghe’s fine run in the claycourt tournament at Stuttgart.\nThe 26-year-old Vandeweghe beat world number one Simona Halep and U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens earlier in the tournament but could not find a way past Pliskova. Tennis - WTA Premier - Stuttgart Tennis Grand Prix - Porsche-Arena, Stuttgart, Britain - April 29, 2018 Czech Republic's Karolina Pliskova celebrates with the trophy after winning the final against CoCo Vandeweghe of the U.S. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\n“It’s the best atmosphere to play in Germany,” Pliskova said after the match. “I want to thank my team. I think we had a great week and without them I would not have the trophy.” Slideshow (3 Images)\nFormer world number one Pliskova trailed 2-0 in the tiebreak at the end of a tight first set but reeled off seven points in a row for an early advantage in the contest.\nAfter Vandeweghe called for the trainer following a tumble early in the second set, Pliskova raised her level and broke her bruised opponent’s serve to go up 3-2.\nPliskova saved a breakpoint in the next game to increase her lead. She then broke Vandeweghe again to make it 5-2 before the American attempted a late fightback with a break of her own.\nPliskova, however, maintained focus to serve out the match.\nVictory in Stuttgart gave world number six Pliskova a 10th career title and her first since winning the trophy in Eastbourne last year.
