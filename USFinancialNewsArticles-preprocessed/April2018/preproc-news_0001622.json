(Nasdaq:SGRP), a leading supplier of retail merchandising, business technology and other marketing services in 10 countries throughout North America, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Africa, today announced financial results and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nHighlights for the three and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same periods in the prior year include:\nRevenue of 2017 increased $5.5 million, or 12 percent, to $50 million. International operations (primarily the 2016 acquisition of Brazil) contributed to year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Revenue for the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2017 increased $47.1 million, or 35 percent, to $181.4 million. The growth in revenue was directly attributable to the international operations (primarily the acquisition of Brazil), which added approximately $40 million, plus approximately $7 million increase from domestic operations. Operating income increased $1.0 million, or 119 percent, to $1.8 compared to $824,000 during the same period last year. The growth in operating income in the fourth quarter was directly attributable to international operations. Operating income for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017 increased $1.9 million, or 86 percent, to $4.1 million compared to $2.2 million during the same period of 2016. International operations contributed $1.3 million of the improvement year over year, with domestic operations contributing approximately $600,000. GAAP net loss attributable to SPAR Group of 2017 was $1.3 million, or $(0.06) per share; compared to net income of $87,000 or $0.00 per diluted share, during the fourth quarter of 2016. As detailed below, this year’s non-GAAP measurement of fourth quarter net income, prior to recording a non-cash tax provision charge of $1.8 million related to the adoption of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Act”), was approximately $600,000 or $0.03 per diluted share. GAAP net loss attributable to SPAR Group for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $923,000, or $(0.04) per share; compared to a net income of $173,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, for the same period in 2016. Non-GAAP measurement of total year net income, prior to recording a non-cash tax provision charge of $1.8 million related to the Act, was approximately $900,000 or $0.04 per diluted share.\nFinancial Results by Geography (in 000's, except per share data) Three Months Ended December 31, % Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n% Revenue: 2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 Change International $ 37,816 $ 31,832 18.8 % $ 129,108 $ 89,345 44.5 % Domestic 12,204 12,711 (4.0 )% 52,273 44,979 16.2 % Total $ 50,020 $ 44,543 12.3 % $ 181,381 $ 134,324 35.0 %\nThree Months Ended December 31, % Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n%\nOperating Income: 2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 Change International $ 1,990 $ 759 162.0 % $ 3,572 $ 2,255 58.4 % Domestic (184 ) 65 (n/a) 518 (53 ) n/a Total $ 1,806 $ 824 119.2 % $ 4,090 $ 2,202 85.7 %\nThree Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31, Net (loss) income: 2017 2016 2017 2016 International $ 1,030 $ 67 $ 843 $ 110 Domestic (2,299 ) 20 (1,766 ) 63 Total $ (1,269 ) $ 87 $ (923 ) $ 173 Earnings Per Basic and Diluted share: $ (0.06\n) $ (0.00 ) $ (0.04 ) $ 0.01 “Fourth quarter operating results reflected a strong finish to a year that saw significant revenue growth and improvement in profitability. Top line growth was led by the acquisition of our Brazil operations, which is providing the beachhead for further growth in Brazil, as well as the rest of South America. In addition, our international business saw strong organic growth in Mexico, Japan and South Africa. As expected, fourth quarter comparisons for our domestic business were made difficult by the accelerated timing of project work in the fourth quarter last year. Nevertheless, we saw strong organic growth in our domestic business during the year and have built a strong pipeline for growth in 2018,” said Chief Executive Officer, Christiaan Olivier. “We will face headwinds domestically during 2018 due to store closures of certain retail customers, as well as cost pressures from a tight labor market. However, we see significant opportunities for organic growth, which we expect will more than offset headwinds and result in strong year-over-year financial comparisons. Domestically, I am also encouraged about our recent acquisition of Resource Plus, which is creating some cross-selling opportunities, as well as a new platform for growth. The pipeline of opportunities is equally attractive in our international operations, which we expect to show continued top and bottom line improvements.”\nMr. Olivier also provided an update on strategic and operational initiatives. \"While we have seen improvement in recent financial performance, given SPAR’s strong foundation, the Company is still operating significantly below its potential. As such, we are in the process of finalizing a comprehensive strategic and operational plan designed to enhance growth and improve financial results. The plan entails introducing new complementary services, new marketing initiatives, operational changes, targeted international expansion, and productivity enhancing technology investments. I look forward to working with our team to implement these initiatives in the coming quarters and am committed to building sustainable improvements in financial performance and shareholder value.”\nGross Margin Profile by Geography\nThree Months Ended December 31, Basis Point Twelve Months Ended December 31, Basis Point 2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 Change International 19.6 % 18.4 % 121 17.5 % 19.1 % (164) Domestic 29.2 % 25.3 % 394 27.1 % 27.6 % (54) Total 22.0 % 20.4 % 159 20.3 % 22.0 % (172) International gross profit margin and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was 19.6% and 17.5%, compared to 18.4 and 19.1%, respectively, for the same periods in 2016. The full year gross margin change relative to the prior period was primarily due to a mix of higher cost dedicated business in Brazil while other international subsidiaries remained constant with prior period gross profit margins.\nDomestic gross profit margin and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, was 29.2% and 27.1%, compared to 25.3% and 27.6%, respectively, for the same periods in 2016. The decrease in total year domestic gross profit margin was primarily due to an increase in lower margin project work compared to the same period last year.\nBalance Sheet as of December 31, 2017\nAs of December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents totaled $8.8 million. Working capital was $14.5 million and current ratio was 1.4 to 1. Total current assets and total assets were $46.8 million and $58.0 million, respectively. Both current liabilities and total liabilities were $32.4 million and total equity was $25.6 million as of December 31, 2017.\nAbout SPAR Group\nSPAR Group, Inc. is a diversified international merchandising and marketing services Company and provides a broad array of services worldwide to help companies improve their sales, operating efficiency and profits at retail locations.

These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for the Company's GAAP results.\nSource: SPAR Group",
