Now barricaded inside a room with coworkers,” YouTube employee Vadim Lavrusik said on Twitter. He later tweeted that he was safe and had been evacuated. \n“We were sitting in a meeting and then we heard people running because it was rumbling the floor. First thought was earthquake,” Todd Sherman, a YouTube product manager, said on Twitter. \nLocal television images showed YouTube employees walking out of the building with their hands raised.
