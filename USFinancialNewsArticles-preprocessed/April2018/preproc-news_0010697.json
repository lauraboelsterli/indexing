    "text": "MONTEVIDEO, April 4 (Reuters) - Consumer prices in Uruguay rose 0.28 percent in March, the government’s National Statistics Institute said on Wednesday, below market expectations for a 0.58 percent increase.\nThat brought the 12-month inflation rate to 6.65 percent, back within the central bank’s target range of 3-7 percent after inflation hit 7.07 percent in February. So far this year, consumer prices have increased 3.9 percent. (Reporting by Malena Castaldi Writing by Luc Cohen Editing by Susan Thomas)\n ",
