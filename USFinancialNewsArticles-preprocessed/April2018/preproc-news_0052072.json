We are on the cautious side,” Maltese Finance Minister Edward Scicluna told reporters before the ministerial meeting in Sofia, the Bulgarian capital.\nTax reforms at EU level require unanimous backing of all its 28 member states, contrary to most legislative reforms which are approved by qualified majority.\nThe commission said a long-term, global solution based on a new method to calculate tax rights was the preferred option, but it would take a long time to be approved.

Germany has a more cautious approach and questions the rationale of a tax on turnovers.\nSuch a tax would be a major shift from existing rules, whereby companies are charged on their profits and pay no tax if they report losses.\nAsked whether a turnover tax was inconsistent with global practices, Angel Gurria, head of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the body that coordinates tax policies among rich countries worldwide, urged not to address the problem hastily.\nGurria, who was attending the EU meeting, said work for a global reform, which would include the United States, Japan and China, was already under way and cautioned against adopting measures that could be inconsistent with a long-term solution.\nHe said the OECD was ready to speed up its work for a global overhaul of digital taxation, possibly advancing to next year the adoption of a blueprint on the issue that is currently due in 2020.
