    "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s trade surplus with the United States rose 19.4 percent in the first quarter to $58.25 billion from the same period a year earlier, customs said on Friday.\nContainers are seen at the Yangshan Deep Water Port, part of the Shanghai Free Trade Zone, in Shanghai, China March 14, 2018. REUTERS/Aly Song China’s March trade surplus with the U.S. fell to $15.32 billion, according to Reuters calculations based on official data, compared with $20.96 billion for February.\nThe data follows weeks of tit-for-tat tariff threats by Washington and Beijing, sparked by U.S. frustration with China’s massive bilateral trade surplus and intellectual property policies, which have fueled fears of a global trade war.\nChina’s exports to the U.S. increased 14.8 percent from a year earlier in January-March period, spokesman Huang Songping told a briefing in Beijing, while imports from the U.S. also rose 8.9 percent.\nCustoms has not yet released the data for March.\nReporting by Elias Glenn and Beijing Monitoring Desk; Editing by Kim Coghill\n ",
