Spotify, which provides free on-demand music or ad-free tunes for paying customers, said it will now also provide video content and podcasts. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton Highlight\nSpotify’s unusual route to becoming a public company is a test case for other multibillion-dollar tech companies that are looking to sell their shares but are not in need of cash. Investors will be able to buy and sell shares in the Swedish music streaming service in the New York Stock Exchange’s first-ever direct floor listing.\nBreakingviews\nSpotify’s direct listing piles risks upon risks. The music-streaming service’s market debut was unusual already – but it comes as specific fears over Facebook and Amazon are spilling over into wider tech valuations.\nCommentary\nThe Trump administration has said that it wants to reduce foreign tariffs and trade barriers. This is a worthy goal because even if average tariffs are generally low , they are quite high for certain products, like apparel and clothing.\nWorld\nCentral American migrants participating in a caravan heading to the U.S. wait in line for a meal in Matias Romero, Oaxaca, Mexico April 2, 2018. REUTERS/Jose de Jesus Cortes In some of the Mexican towns playing host to a “caravan” of more than 1,200 Central American migrants heading to the U.S. border, the welcome mat has been rolled out despite Trump’s call for Mexican authorities to stop them.\nHong Kong’s once thriving pro-democracy movement, weighed down by growing pessimism among its supporters over China’s ever-increasing control in the city , is facing a crisis of confidence about its future.\nBusiness\nChina will take counter-measures of the “same proportion” and scale if the United States imposes further tariffs on Chinese goods , China’s ambassador to Washington said, amid growing fears of an impending trade war.\nRupert Murdoch has stepped up the pressure on Britain to approve his $14.5 billion bid for Sky by offering to sell or legally separate Sky News, seeking to allay concerns about the 87-year-old mogul’s political influence.\nWhen China closed its local cryptocurrency exchanges late last year, an underground ecosystem of bitcoin “mules” and peer-to-peer platforms sprung up to allow bitcoin trading to thrive, away from regulators’ watchful eyes.\nCBS plans to make an all-stock offer for Viacom that values the U.S. media company below its current market valuation , people familiar with the matter said on Monday, indicating that tough negotiations lie ahead.\nReuters TV\nA Texan who was dubbed the “affluenza teen” was released from jail on Monday after serving nearly two years for killing four people while driving drunk and later fleeing to Mexico with his mother, law enforcement officials said.\n ",
