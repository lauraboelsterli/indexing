    "text": "COLOMBO, April 26 (Reuters) - The Sri Lankan rupee weakened to a record closing low on Thursday as dollar demand from importers and banks surpassed the exporter greenback sales, dealers said.\nThe rupee closed at 157.75/95 against the dollar on Thursday, weakening further from its previous record low of 157.60/75 hit on Wednesday.\nThe rupee has fallen 0.9 percent so far this week and 1.4 percent this month.\n“There were some (dollar) conversions by exporters. But the demand was high from importers and also some foreigners selling (government) securities,” a currency dealer said.\nSome dealers said dollar purchases by oil importers, who usually buy dollars from banks, weighed on the currency.\nThe rupee has weakened 2.7 percent so far this year. It dropped 2.5 percent last year and 3.9 percent in 2016.\nThe International Monetary Fund said last week that the central bank should continue to remain vigilant in guarding against inflationary pressures, “while continuing to build reserves and supporting greater exchange rate flexibility”.\nDealers said they expect the rupee to gradually weaken and face higher volatility this year due to debt repayments by the government.\nForeign investors sold government securities worth a net 1.8 billion rupees ($11.5 million) so far this year through April 18, central bank data showed.
