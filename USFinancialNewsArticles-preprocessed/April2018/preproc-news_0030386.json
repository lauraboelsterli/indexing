    "text": "YTD Revenues Increase 168% to $6M and $282K Net Income ($862K as Adjusted)\nJACKSONVILLE, FL, April 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- mCig Inc., (OTCQB:MCIG), a leading distributor of innovative products, technologies, and services for the global medical cannabis industry, announces its third quarter and year to date results ending January 31, 2018.\nMCIG recorded $780K in revenue bringing its year-to-date (YTD) total to $6.0 million in revenue, as compared to $2.2 million for the same period last year, an increase of 168%. During the quarter ending January 31, 2018, the Company expanded into agriculture with its expansion into the organic hemp growing business in New York and in its application process for cannabis growing and manufacturing licensure in California.\nIncome from operations increased YTD by $300K ($600K as adjusted) as compared to the same period last year, a 316% as adjusted increase in profitability from operations. Cost of Goods and Services sold has been reduced by 7% YTD and 19% for the quarter ending January 31, 2018. We attribute this decline in costs of goods primarily to the reduction of percentage of income derived from the construction division, which traditionally has low margins, from 51% of the revenue to just 15% of our revenue generated.\nWhile expending $2.3 million YTD in advancing our operations and expanding our capital assets, we have reduced our liabilities by 34% and our cash position has increased 61% as compared to the same period last year.\nPaul Rosenberg, MCIG’s CEO, stated, “We continue to expand operations and 2018 looks to be a very good year for MCIG. As we spin-off our tech division and supply division, we will focus on our development and growth into agriculture, extraction, and product development.”\nAbout MCIG Group ( MCIG )\nHeadquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, mCig, Inc. ( www.mciggroup.com ) is a diversified company servicing the legal cannabis, hemp and CBD markets. mCig, Inc. is committed to being the leading distributor of technology, products, and services to fit the needs of a rapidly expanding industry.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nAny statements contained in this press release that do not describe historical facts may constitute forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
