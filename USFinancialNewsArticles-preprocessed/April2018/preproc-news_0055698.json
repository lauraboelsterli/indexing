    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus is targeting “surge” production capacity of 63 A320-family aircraft a month from 2019 but only 60 deliveries a month from the middle of that year, Finance Director Harald Wilhelm said.\nWilhelm told reporters that Airbus saw potential commercial demand for 70 or 70-plus of the same aircraft in the longer term, but that no decisions had been taken.\nThe comments elaborate on a verbal statement from Airbus this week that it was raising its target for production to 63 aircraft a month from 2019, confirming a newspaper report.\nDrawing a distinction between production and deliveries, Wilhelm said that since 2015, Airbus had set out plans for 60 deliveries a month from 2019 with buffer capacity allowing production to reach 63. These plans have not changed, he added.\nOn Oct 30, 2015, Airbus said in a press release it planned to “further increase the production rate” to 60 aircraft a month in mid-2019.\nOn production of other models, Airbus said on Friday it was reducing the number of A330 deliveries to 50 per year in 2019.\nAsked to provide a comparison, Wilhelm told reporters that Airbus was targeting 60 deliveries of the long-haul jet family in 2018.\n(This version of the story corrects number of A330 deliveries in 2018 to 60, in last paragraph)\nReporting by Tim Hepher; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ",
