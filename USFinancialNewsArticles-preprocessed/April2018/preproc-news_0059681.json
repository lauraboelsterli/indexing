    "text": "0 COMMENTS\nEuropean Central Bank officials face a cloudy economic outlook as they gather in Frankfurt this week. Growth indicators for the 19-nation eurozone have deteriorated in recent months, and economists aren’t quite sure why.\nThe timing of the slowdown is awkward for the ECB because it is preparing to phase out its €30 billion-a-month ($36.7 billion) bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing, or QE. The program is widely expected to end this year, but any significant weakness in the eurozone economy could force a delay.\nNo policy action is expected from the ECB on Thursday. But the bank’s president, Mario Draghi, is likely to discuss whether he thinks the risks to the region’s economy have increased. He might even suggest investors are right to push back their forecasts for a first ECB interest-rate increase until later next year.\nHere are five reasons Mr. Draghi might give for the apparent economic slowdown:\nTrade Tensions U.S. President Donald Trump’s rhetoric on trade appears to be mostly aimed at China , but Europe would suffer from any breakdown in global trade relations. ECB officials have warned that the threat of trade wars already may be damping business sentiment and investment. The eurozone is particularly vulnerable because exports make up such a large share of its economy.\nEuro Rising The single currency has appreciated sharply against the dollar over the past year, rising to $1.22 from $1.06. That tends to weigh on eurozone growth and inflation because it makes the area’s exports more expensive and its imports cheaper. It is a concern for the ECB because eurozone inflation, at 1.3%, remains below the bank’s target of just under 2%.\nVolatile Markets Global financial markets have been unsettled in recent months, partly reflecting concerns that central banks will phase out easy money. Market volatility is a problem for the ECB if it threatens the flow of credit to eurozone businesses and consumers. Also, oil prices have risen sharply and are trading close to three-year highs. That could push up inflation in the short term but also hurt growth.\nCapacity Constraints Some eurozone businesses are struggling to find skilled workers as the region’s unemployment rate declines. That is likely to slow the region’s growth, but it might be looked on favorably by the ECB if it starts to push up wages and inflation.\nOne-Off Factors Economists have suggested a range of exceptional reasons for the eurozone’s recent weakness. They range from a spell of cold weather, to an outbreak of flu, to strikes and the timing of public holidays. If such factors really are to blame, ECB officials simply could wait for their effects to melt from the economic data.\nWrite to Tom Fairless at tom.fairless@wsj.com",
