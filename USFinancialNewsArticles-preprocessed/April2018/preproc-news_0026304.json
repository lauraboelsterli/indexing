Hobbs \nFormer first lady Barbara Bush is in failing health and has decided not to seek additional medical treatment, according to a family spokesman. \nBush, 92, has had a recent series of hospitalizations, spokesman Jim McGrath said in a statement Sunday. He said that after consulting with her family and doctors, she decided to not seek additional medical treatment and instead will focus on “comfort care.” \n“It will not surprise those who know her that Barbara Bush has been a rock in the face of her failing health, worrying not for herself — thanks to her abiding faith — but for others,” McGrath stated. “She is surrounded by a family she adores, and appreciates the many kind messages and especially the prayers she is receiving.” \nBush has been married to 41st President George H.W. Bush for 73 years. He served from 1989 to 1993. The Bushes had six children, including former President George W. Bush and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. One daughter died at age 3 in 1953 after fighting leukemia.",
