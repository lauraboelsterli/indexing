FILE PHOTO: Ray-Ban sunglasses logo, a Luxottica brand, is seen in Milan, Italy January 23, 2017. REUTERS/ Stefano Rellandini\nWhen including the impact of a stronger euro, especially against the U.S. dollar, sales at the world’s biggest eyewear group fell 11 percent in January-March from a year earlier.\nLuxottica expects to conclude in May a planned merger with lens maker Essilor ( ESSI.PA ) to create a 50 billion euro (44 billion pounds) eyewear giant better able to tap demand for glasses from an ageing world population as competition stiffens.\nLuxottica’s wholesale revenue fell 4.2 percent annually at constant currencies in the first quarter as bad weather in Europe in March led shopkeepers to delay orders. The company is also suffering due to tighter distribution policies.\nRetail sales fell 0.6 percent on a comparable-store basis and net of currency moves as the strong performance of Sunglass Hut was more than offset by weak sales of sunglasses in Europe and ongoing difficulties at the group’s U.S. optical retailer LensCrafters.
