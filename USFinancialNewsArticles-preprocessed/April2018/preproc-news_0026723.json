    "text": "ST. JOHN’S, Newfoundland and Labrador--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TSX: ALS Altius Minerals Corporation (“Altius” or the “Corporation”) reports that it will release financial results for its first quarter of 2018 on May 14, 2018 after the close of market. The Q1 2018 results will be presented in comparison with the three month period ended April 30, 2017 as a result of the recent conversion to a calendar year end.\nAltius expects to report attributable royalty revenue 1 of approximately $15.7 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2018, which is 17% higher compared to $13.4 million reported in the quarter ended April 30, 2017. Previously updated royalty revenue guidance for the year remains at $64 - $69 million, reflecting a higher 91.3% interest in the potash royalties that became effective March 23, 2018 and that will more fully impact subsequent quarters.\nThe first quarter results experienced growth from all commodity segments on a year over year comparable quarter basis. Royalty revenues benefited particularly from stronger production results from Chapada during its typically slower rainy season, production volume and price growth at the Rocanville potash mine, and a return to higher royalties from the Sheerness coal operation as mine sequencing has migrated to higher royalty paying lands. The Labrador Iron Ore Royalty Corporation paid only a minimal dividend above its base rate, as the Iron Ore Company of Canada was impacted by labour disruption. Additional details relating to individual royalty performances will be provided with the release of full financial results.\nSummary of attributable royalty revenue Three months ended\nMarch 31\nThree months ended\nApril 30\nChange (in thousands of Canadian dollars) 2018 2017 Base metals 7,189 6,283 14% Thermal (electrical) coal 4,099 3,710 11% Potash 2,228 1,613 30% Iron ore (2) 1,103 854 29% Metallurgical coal 757 683 11% Coal bed methane and interest 311 235 32% Attributable royalty revenue 15,687 13,378 17% (2) LIF dividends\nQ1 2018 Financials Conference Call and Webcast Information:\nA conference call will be held on Tuesday, May 15, 2018, starting at 8:00 a.m. EST to further discuss the quarter and guidance for 2018.

The Corporation is finalizing the adoption of IFRS 15 and these figures are subject to change. For a detailed description and examples of the reconciliation of this measure, please see the Corporation’s MD&A disclosures for prior quarterly and annual reporting periods, which are available at http://altiusminerals.com/financial-statements\nAbout Altius\nAltius directly and indirectly held diversified royalties and streams generate revenue from 15 operating mines.

The portfolio also includes numerous pre-development stage royalties covering a wide spectrum of mineral commodities and jurisdictions. It also holds a large portfolio of exploration stage projects which it has generated for deal making with industry partners that results in newly created royalties and equity and minority interests.\nAltius has 43,215,026 common shares issued and outstanding that are listed on Canada’s Toronto Stock Exchange. It is a member of both the S&P/TSX Small Cap and S&P/TSX Global Mining Indices.\nForward-Looking Information\nThis news release contains forward‐looking information.
