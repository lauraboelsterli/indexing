    "text": "Check out the companies making headlines after the bell :\nSwitch shares plummeted as much as 24 percent after hours. The data storage company reported a loss per share of $2.09, which was much larger than the 12 cents Wall Street expected. Switch attributed the loss to a one-time compensation expense. Revenues beat estimates, and guidance for the upcoming year was in line with estimates.\nViacom stock dropped more than 2 percent in the extended session. Sources familiar told CNBC on Monday afternoon that a CBS bid for Viacom would value the media company below its current market valuation . This may indicate difficult negotiations to come.\nShares of CVD Equipment rallied more than 10 percent post-market after the research equipment manufacturer announced its best financial results throughout its 35-year history. Fourth-quarter revenue rose 34 percent to $9.8 million.\nCancer Genetics stock plunged more than 33 percent after the bell. The biotech company reported losses per share larger than expected and missed revenue estimates by nearly $2 million. It plans to conduct a \"comprehensive and extensive\" review of its strategy and organization.",
