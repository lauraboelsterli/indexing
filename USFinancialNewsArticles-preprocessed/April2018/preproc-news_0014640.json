That semi-final will now be completed after U.S. Open finalist Madison Keys and Dutch 12th seed Kiki Bertens meet in the other semi-final on Sunday morning, tournament officials said. The championship match will follow in the afternoon. (Reporting by Gene Cherry in Salvo, North Carolina, editing by Pritha Sarkar)",
