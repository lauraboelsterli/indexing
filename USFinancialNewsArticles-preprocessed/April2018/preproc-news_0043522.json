The logo of Samsung is seen on a building during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain February 25, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman/Files \nSamsung will recruit more Vietnamese employees and develop electronics in smart cities in Bac Ninh province and other places, according to a statement posted on the government’s website. \nSamsung is the largest foreign investor in Vietnam and accounts for around a quarter of the country’s total export revenue. \nPhuc told Koh that Vietnam is always willing to create the most favourable conditions for Samsung to develop in the country, the statement said. \nSamsung has invested $17.3 billion in eight factories and one research and development centre in Vietnam, turning the country into its largest smart phone production base, the government said. \nExports from Samsung Electronics’ factories in Vietnam totalled $54 billion last year, it said.
