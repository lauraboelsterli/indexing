She holds a Master of Arts in Languages from the University of Complutense in Madrid and a Master of International Management from the American Graduate School of International Management. She currently serves on the Board of Directors for Halyard Health, Orthofix International and MRI Interventions.\nDavid Bruce most recently served as COO for Catheter Robotics, a privately held, commercial stage, remote catheter systems company. There he was responsible for planning and executing strategy for commercial market penetration, clinical studies and additional regulatory clearances for label expansion. Prior to that, Bruce served as President and CEO and Director of Arstasis, an arterial access device company, which he transitioned from development to commercialization and growth. Before Arstasis Bruce served as CEO and Director of Patient Safety Technologies, CEO and Director of EP MedSystems, and Platform General Manager of the AcuNav Catheter Business for Siemens Medical Solutions Ultrasound Division.
