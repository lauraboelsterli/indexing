    "text": "LONG BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE: MOH):\nNet income increases to $1.64 per diluted share from $1.37 in the first quarter of 2017. First quarter results include a net benefit of $0.38 per diluted share for the net impact of the reconciliation of 2017 Marketplace cost sharing reduction (CSR) subsidies and other items not included in the Company’s preliminary 2018 guidance. First quarter 2017 results had included a benefit of $0.84 per diluted share from the termination fee for a proposed acquisition. Premium revenue decreases 7.0% compared with the first quarter of 2017, as expected with the Company’s repositioning of Marketplace operations. Medical care ratio decreases to 86.1% from 88.4% in the first quarter of 2017. General and administrative expense ratio decreases to 7.6% from 8.9% in the first quarter of 2017. 2018 guidance increased by $1.00 per diluted share to a range of $4.00–$4.50 net income per diluted share and $4.24–$4.74 adjusted net income per diluted share. Revised 2018 guidance includes the net benefit of $0.38 per diluted share for items noted above that were not included in the Company’s preliminary 2018 guidance and $0.62 per diluted share in improved performance against the Company’s original internal estimates for the full year of 2018.\nMolina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE: MOH) today reported its financial results for the first quarter of 2018 and provided its revised guidance for fiscal year 2018.\n“The financial results that we announced today reflect the progress we are making towards our goal of sustainable margin recovery,” said Joe Zubretsky, President and CEO. “First quarter results of $1.64 net income per diluted share are a significant improvement over 2017 and favorable to our expectations. Whether measured by key operating metrics, product line or health plan geography, we met or exceeded our expectations in most areas.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (In millions, except per-share amounts) Premium revenue $ 4,323 $ 4,648 Operating income $ 222 $ 82 Net income $ 107 $ 77 Net income per diluted share $ 1.64 $ 1.37 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 65.2 56.2 Operating Statistics: Medical care ratio (1) 86.1 % 88.4 % G&A ratio (2) 7.6 % 8.9 % Premium tax ratio (1) 2.3 % 2.3 % Effective income tax expense rate 40.3 % 41.6 % Net profit margin (2) 2.3 % 1.6 % (1) Medical care ratio represents medical care costs as a percentage of premium revenue; premium tax ratio represents premium tax expenses as a percentage of premium revenue plus premium tax revenue. (2) G&A ratio represents general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue. Net profit margin represents net income as a percentage of total revenue. Summary of Significant Items Affecting Comparative First Quarter Financial Results\nThe table below summarizes the impact of certain items significant to the Company’s financial performance in the periods presented. The individual items presented below increase (decrease) income before income tax expense.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Per\nPer\nDiluted\nDiluted\nAmount Share (1)\nAmount Share (1)\n(In millions, except per diluted share amounts) Reimbursement of Marketplace CSR subsidies, for 2017 dates of service $ 70 $ 0.83 $ — $ — Restructuring costs (25 ) (0.30 ) — — Loss on debt extinguishment (10 ) (0.15 ) — — Fee received for terminated acquisition — — 75 0.84 $ 35 $ 0.38 $ 75 $ 0.84 (1) Except for certain items that are not deductible for tax purposes, per diluted share amounts are generally calculated at statutory income tax rates of 22% and 37% for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively. First Quarter of 2018 Compared With First Quarter of 2017\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was $107 million, compared with net income of $77 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net income per diluted share was $1.64 for the first quarter of 2018 compared with $1.37 reported for the first quarter of 2017. Improved performance in the first quarter of 2018 resulted from improved medical and administrative cost efficiency.\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 included a net benefit of $35 million ($0.38 per diluted share) for items not included in the Company’s preliminary 2018 guidance. Net income for the first quarter of 2017 included a benefit of $75 million ($0.84 per diluted share) for the receipt of an acquisition termination fee.\nPremium revenue decreased approximately 7% when compared with the first quarter of 2017. Lower premium revenue was driven by a decrease in Marketplace membership of over 50%, partially offset by Marketplace premium rate increases. As previously disclosed, the Company has increased premium rates and reduced its Marketplace presence effective January 1, 2018, as part of its overall program to improve profitability.\nOverall, the medical care ratio decreased to 86.1%, from 88.4% in the first quarter of 2017. Excluding the benefit of the 2017 CSR reimbursement, the consolidated medical care ratio was 87.7% in the first quarter of 2018.\nThe medical care ratio for the Medicaid and Medicare programs combined decreased to 90.0%, from 91.0% in the first quarter of 2017. Improved performance at the Florida, Illinois, Ohio and South Carolina health plans, partially offset by a decline in performance at the Washington health plan, drove the decrease in the consolidated medical care ratio for Medicaid and Medicare combined. The 2017 CSR reimbursement had no impact on the medical care ratio for the Company’s Medicaid and Medicare programs. The medical care ratio for the Company’s Marketplace operations was 50.6% for the first quarter of 2018. Excluding the impact of the 2017 Marketplace CSR adjustment noted below, the medical care ratio for Marketplace operations decreased to approximately 67%, from 75% in the first quarter of 2017. Improved profitability in Marketplace operations is primarily the result of premium increases implemented effective January 1, 2018.\nThe general and administrative (G&A) expense ratio decreased to 7.6%, from 8.9% in the first quarter of 2017. Excluding the impact of Marketplace broker commissions and exchange fees in both periods, the G&A ratio decreased to 6.8%, from 7.5% in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Company recognized a benefit of approximately $70 million ($0.83 per diluted share) in reduced medical expense related to 2017 dates of service as a result of the federal government’s confirmation that the reconciliation of 2017 Marketplace CSR subsidies would be performed on an annual basis. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company had assumed a nine-month reconciliation of this item pending confirmation of the time period to which the 2017 reconciliation would be applied.\nApproximately $25 million ($0.30 per diluted share) of restructuring costs were recognized in the first quarter, primarily relating to the write-off of prepaid and other assets in connection with the continuing re-design of core processes.\nApproximately $10 million ($0.15 per diluted share) loss on debt extinguishment was recognized in the first quarter in connection with the issuance of 1.8 million common shares in exchange for $97 million principal amount of the Company’s 1.625% convertible senior notes.\n2018 Revised Guidance\nThe following table summarizes 2018 Revised Guidance (1) :\nRevised Preliminary Premium revenue ~ $17.4B ~ $17.5B Service revenue ~ $525M ~ $525M Premium tax revenue ~ $425M ~ $410M Health insurer fees reimbursed ~ $280M ~ $295M Investment income and other revenue ~ $110M ~ $85M Total revenue ~ $18.7B ~ $18.8B Medical care costs ~$15.4B ~$15.6B Medical care ratio (2) 88% - 89% ~ 89% Cost of service revenue ~ $480M ~ $480M General and administrative expenses ~ $1.4B ~ $1.4B G&A ratio (3) ~ 7.4% ~ 7.3% Premium tax expenses ~$425M ~$410M Health insurer fees ~ $300M ~ $310M Depreciation and amortization ~ $115M ~ $115M Restructuring and separation costs ~ $25M — Interest expense and other income, net ~ $135M ~ $125M Income before income taxes $450M - $495M $355M - $400M Net income $272M - $306M $202M - $236M EBITDA (4) $724M - $768M $632M - $676M Effective tax rate 38% - 40% 41% - 43% Net profit margin (3) 1.5% - 1.6% 1.1% - 1.3% Diluted weighted average shares ~ 68.0M ~ 67.3M Net income per share $4.00 - $4.50 $3.00 - $3.50 Adjusted net income per share (4) $4.24 - $4.74 $3.23 - $3.73 End-of-year Marketplace membership 356,000 303,000 End-of-year Non-Marketplace membership 3,674,000 3,738,000 (1) All amounts are estimates; actual results may differ materially.

MOLINA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nUNAUDITED NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nWe use non-generally accepted accounting principles, or non-GAAP, financial measures as supplemental metrics in evaluating our financial performance, making financing and business decisions, and forecasting and planning for future periods. For these reasons, management believes such measures are useful supplemental measures to investors in comparing our performance to the performance of other public companies in the health care industry. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as supplements to, and not as substitutes for or superior to, GAAP measures.

We believe that EBITDA is helpful in assessing our ability to meet the cash demands of our operating units.\nAdjusted net income: Net income (GAAP) less amortization of intangible assets, net of income tax effect calculated at the statutory tax rate. We believe that adjusted net income is helpful in assessing our financial performance exclusive of the non-cash impact of the amortization of purchased intangibles.\nAdjusted net income per diluted share: Adjusted net income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis.\nMOLINA HEALTHCARE, INC. 2018 REVISED GUIDANCE Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures (in millions, except per-share amounts)\nLow End High End Net income $ 272 $ 306 Adjustments: Depreciation, and amortization of intangible assets and capitalized software 148 148 Interest expense 125 125 Income tax expense 179 189 EBITDA $ 724 $ 768 Low End High End Amount Per share (2) Amount Per share (2) Net income $ 272 $ 4.00 $ 306 $ 4.50 Adjustments: Amortization of intangible assets 21 0.31 21 0.31 Income tax effect (1) (5 ) (0.07 ) (5 ) (0.07 ) Amortization of intangible assets, net of tax effect 16 0.24 16 0.24 Adjusted net income $ 288 $ 4.24 $ 322 $ 4.74",
