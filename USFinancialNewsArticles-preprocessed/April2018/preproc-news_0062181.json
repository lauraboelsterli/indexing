    "text": "April 30, 2018 / 6:54 PM / Updated an hour ago Brazil's President Temer cancels Asia trip ahead of legislative vote Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nBRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Michel Temer’s press office said on Monday he had cancelled a planned visit to four Asian countries because of an important legislative vote this week. Brazil's President Michel Temer steps off the podium at the Planalto Palace in Brasilia, Brazil April 27, 2018. REUTERS/Adriano Machado\nTemer had been expected to visit Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam May 7-14.\nThe office said he would remain in Brazil to push for the passage of a bill that would free funds for the federal government to pay off debt that Venezuela and Mozambique owe to Brazil’s state development bank BNDES and Credit Suisse.\nBrazil, during the administration of former president Dilma Rousseff, had said it would act as a guarantor for the loans, which financed works carried out by Brazilian firms in Venezuela and Mozambique.\nVenezuela owes the vast majority of the nearly 1 billion reais ($286 million) owed to the banks, which must be paid by May 8.\n($1 = 3.4918 reais)",
