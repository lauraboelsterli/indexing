We believe Moviefone will also allow us to provide relevant and appealing content to moviegoers while simultaneously increasing the value of the Moviefone brand.”\n“HMNY’s vision is to have MoviePass support the entire movie theater industry ecosystem-- from distribution to exhibition and now, content,” said HMNY’s Chairman and CEO, Ted Farnsworth. “Above all, we believe the Moviefone acquisition will serve as another valuable source of revenue for HMNY and MoviePass,” concluded Mr. Farnsworth.\n“Moviefone provides users with full access to the entertainment ecosystem, from movie theaters to streaming services and on all screens in between, said Matt Young, VP Entertainment, Oath. “By bringing together MoviePass and Moviefone, entertainment lovers will enjoy the full suite of movie-theater subscription opportunities, discovering, interacting and sharing blockbusters, hit series and underground hits across the worldwide community of film and TV.
