    "text": "By Kirsten Korosec 1:10 PM EDT \nUber is expanding beyond ride-hailing and adding a series of new products to its app to cover all the ways people move around cities, including bikes, paying and booking tickets for buses and rail, and even car rental through a partnership with Getaround. \nCEO Dara Khosrowshahi announced the series of new products and partnerships Wednesday in Washington, D.C. Khosrowshahi, who took the helm several months after co-founder Travis Kalanick resigned , said the aim is to reduce individual car ownership. \nIt’s also a strategic move aimed at long-term survival. Users can now move throughout a city, or even between them, using the Uber app. \nUber announced April 9 that it acquired Jump , an electric “dockless” bike share service. Jump bikes are integrated with the GPS and payment system—unlike docked bike share programs that put that tech in its docking stations. Uber and Jump already had a relationship. In February, Uber added an option in its app that lets users reserve and rent Jump bikes in San Francisco. \nUber’s Khosrowshahi announced Wednesday that the Jump bike rental feature has been expanded to Washington, D.C. \nUber will also launch Uber Rent, its first car-sharing product, beginning with San Francisco. The Uber Rent feature, which is in partnership with car-sharing company Getaround, will let users find cars for short-term rentals using the Uber app. Uber Rent will be available later this month. \nUber has also partnered with Masabi, which has developed a public transit mobile ticketing platform, that will let Ubr users book and use transit tickets in its app. In other words, users will be able to use their Uber app to hail a ride to a public transit station and then use the same app to buy a ticket for a bus or train. \nUber didn’t say when this book-and-buy transit rides option would be available in the Uber app. For now, the two companies will work integrating the Masabi platform into the Uber app and hope to have a product ready later this year. Of course, a natural first step would be for the feature to work in cities that Masabi already has a partnership with. \nMasabi already works with 30 transit agencies and operators in North America, Europe, and Australia. Its U.S. partnerships include New York MTA, Boston MBTA, LA Metrolink, and Las Vegas RTC. \nKhosrowshahi also announced products aimed at urban planners and city officials. \nUber will expanding Uber Movement, a website the company launched last year that offers anonymized and aggregated Uber data to show travel conditions across different times, days or months, and how travel times are impacted by things like big events and road closures in a city. Uber Movement will now be available in 12 more cities: Amsterdam, Bangalore, Brisbane, Cairo, Hyderabad, Melbourne, Mumbai, Nairobi, New Delhi, Perth, Pittsburgh, and Toronto. \nThe company is also working with D.C. transit agencies and SharedStreets in a public-private collaboration to share data on how people are using transportation.",
