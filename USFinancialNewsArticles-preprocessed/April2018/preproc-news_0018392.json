    "text": "April 10, 2018 / 12:19 PM / Updated 34 minutes ago Chalmers swims down Proud to give Australia final title at pool Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nGOLD COAST, Australia (Reuters) - Kyle Chalmers produced a blistering final freestyle leg as Australia regained the men’s 4x100m medley relay title in the final race of the pool at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games on Tuesday. Swimming - Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games - Men's 200m Freestyle Heats - Optus Aquatic Centre - Gold Coast, Australia - April 6, 2018. Kyle Chalmers of Australia. REUTERS/David Gray \nChalmers had trailed England’s Ben Proud for almost the entire two lengths of the pool before he swam down the 50m freestyle champion in the final four strokes to touch in three minutes, 31.04 seconds. \nEngland’s world and Olympic 100m breaststroke champion Adam Peaty had given his team the lead at the halfway stage before butterfly expert James Guy held off Australia’s Grant Irvine to hand over a narrow advantage to Proud. \nChalmers, the Rio Olympics 100m freestyle champion who was beaten by Scotland’s Duncan Scott in the event at the Gold Coast Aquatic Centre, slowly reeled in Proud and beat the Englishman to the wall by 0.09 seconds.
