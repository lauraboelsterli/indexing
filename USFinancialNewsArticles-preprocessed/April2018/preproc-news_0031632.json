    "text": "April 16 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has shelved plans to sell and distribute pharmaceutical products to hospitals, CNBC reported here on Monday, citing sources familiar with the matter.\nThe change in plan comes partly because Amazon has not been able to convince big hospitals to change their traditional purchasing process, the report said.\nAmazon did not immediately respond to Reutersâ€™ request for comment.\nThe report sent shares of U.S. drug distributors including McKesson, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen higher on Monday afternoon.
