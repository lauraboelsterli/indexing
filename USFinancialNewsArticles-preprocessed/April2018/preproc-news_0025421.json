    "text": "HOUSTON (Reuters) - Total SA returned the small crude distillation unit (CDU) and associated vacuum distillation unit (VDU) to production overnight at its 225,500 barrel per day (bpd) Port Arthur, Texas, refinery, Gulf Coast market sources said on Thursday.\nThe Port Arthur refinery has restarted almost all units that were shut down on Saturday when steam supply was lost to a part of the plant, the sources said.\nThe 40,000 bpd ACU-2 CDU and attached 51,000 bpd VDU restarted early on Wednesday, but did not resume production until Thursday because of a pump problem, the sources said.\nOnly the Benzene-Toulene-Xylene unit remained shut on Thursday, the sources said.\nTotal spokeswoman Marie Maitre declined comment.\nSteam supply to a section of the refinery was lost when the 76,000 bpd gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) was forced to shut down by a leaking pipe, according to the sources.\nThe FCCU and 5,000 bpd alkylation unit restarted on Monday, the sources said.\nA sulfur recovery unit and hydrotreaters were also shut by the steam outage, according to the sources.\nCDUs operate at atmospheric pressure and do the primary refining of crude oil, providing hydrocarbon feedstock from all other units. VDUs take residual crude oil from CDUs and refine it at vacuum pressure.\nAlkylation units convert refining byproducts into octane-boosting components blended into gasoline.\nHydrotreaters extract hydrogen sulfide from motor fuels in compliance with U.S. environmental rules. Sulfur recovery units extract sulfur from hydrogen sulfide.\nReporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by Dan Grebler and Leslie Adler\n ",
