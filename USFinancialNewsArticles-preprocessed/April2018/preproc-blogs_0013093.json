    "text": "Wells Fargo faces a record fine of at least several hundred million dollars for consumer abuses, according to a report .\nThe bank, which has labored under a fake accounts scandal and other black eyes since September 2016, is being targeted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Reuters reported, citing sources.\nThe bank already has paid a $100 million CFPB penalty to settle the fake accounts issue, in which employees opened some 3.5 million accounts for customers without their knowledge. Employees involved were trying to meet aggressive sales goals, which have since been discontinued. That fine was part of a $185 million settlement Wells made with various authorities.\nFor the latest fine, Wells Fargo would pay for auto insurance and mortgage lending abuses. Reuters pointed out that this would be the first major penalty issued by CFPB since Mick Mulvaney, who also heads the Office of Management and Budget, took over.\nMulvaney may push for a fine as high as $1 billion, Reuters reported.\nWells Fargo declined to comment and the CFPB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIn the mortgage case, the bank allegedly made unauthorized changes to borrowers' accounts that lowered monthly payments but extended the terms in some cases for decades.\nThe auto insurance infractions involve cases where employees forced more than half a million drivers to buy coverage they did not need. The bank blamed the situation on a third-party vendor.\nThe full Reuters story can be read here .",
