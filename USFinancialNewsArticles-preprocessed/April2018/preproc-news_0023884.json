But it’s now time to push the envelope and reach far more impressive milestones,” Stefan Moreau continued. “We’re targeting a surge in growth—a 30% compounded year-over-year increase—in the next three to five years. These leadership and infrastructure changes will help drive that growth.”\nNew Appointments\nLeading the company’s new appointments is that of David Fout to Chairman of the Board of Advisors. Fout is an entrepreneur, business executive, and investor. He has more than 25 years of business, technology and federal government experience. He has built and led numerous organizations by leveraging his strong leadership, strategic thinking, and values to create a clear and compelling vision with strong accountability and sense of purpose.\nIn 2002, he co-founded Aquilent and built an award-winning, dynamic growth company that provided innovative solutions to solve critical problems for the federal government. In 2017, Fout led the sale of Aquilent to Booz Allen Hamilton for $250 million. Also in 2017, he founded Fout Capital—a venture capital firm that invests in and supports early-stage and emerging value-focused growth companies—as well as Daptation, a consulting organization that helps businesses build long term, sustained growth and success through framework leadership principles. Previously, Fout served as Chief Operating Officer of Commerce One's E-Government division, and Vice President of AppNet's E-Business and Technology Division.\nOver his career, Fout has been honored with numerous awards, including five-times-named a CEO of the Year Finalist by both GovCon and the Tech Council of Maryland and a Smart100 CEO winner. He is actively involved in his community and evangelizes social responsibility within organizations. He is active in a number of professional organizations including the Young Presidents’ Organization (YPO), and is a Leadership Montgomery graduate.\nFout holds a Master of Science in Information Systems and Technology from Johns Hopkins University and a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems Management from the University of Maryland Baltimore County.\nJim Boyd , new Executive Vice President, brings 20 years of IT experience, with the past 15 in the IT staffing industry. Boyd comes from Convergenz, where he spent the past five years as Executive Vice President, managing both sales and delivery teams and coaching new team members to success.

In 2010 he was promoted to the VP of Business Development, and in 2013 became the EVP of the Southwest Region. During his 12+ years there, Boyd brought in dozens of accounts, including several Fortune 50 firms. He oversaw the acquisition and maintenance of the largest account in the company’s history, which is in its 10th year as the company’s largest account. He has worked with more than 100 accounts during his tenure, becoming one of the top vendors at many of them. These clients include: Fannie Mae, Capital One, Deloitte, Marriott, TIAA-CREF, Johnson and Johnson, BNSF, Frontier Communications, Verizon Business, Charles Schwab, GM Financial, MoneyGram, Dell, NTT Data, SAIC, Serco, AOL, IMF, and others. Before his tenure at Convergenz, Boyd worked at Comsys (now part of Manpower), where he brought in many new accounts and was recognized as a top producer.\nIn his new role at The Midtown Group, Boyd will lead the company’s sales effort in the Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Virginia markets and existing territories; he will also head up the company’s California office and expand its footprint nationally.\nBoyd holds a Bachelor of Science in Economics from the University of Maryland.\nPatrick Smith , Senior Controller, comes to The Midtown Group from Aerotek, Inc., where he spent more than three years as a Controller on the company’s Finance team.
