We'll also show you how to turn auto-correct off on your iPhone entirely. Jose A. Bernat Bacete | Moment | Getty Close-up portrait of a female Mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos). Tablas de Daimiel, Spain. \nThere's a way to stop your Apple iPhone from auto-correcting your text to \"ducking\" when you meant to type ... something else. \nThe iPhone automatically enables auto-correct on its keyboards, which means it'll automatically fix a typo like \"adn\" to \"and\" if you're typing quickly and misspell a word. It's convenient most of the time, but it can get awfully annoying when it auto-corrects common words. \nThere are two fixes: Turning off auto-correct entirely, or applying a list of words into the \"text replacement\" field on your iPhone. The latter creates a shortcut for words or phrases you type frequently. If you type, \"omw\" for example, the phone will automatically spell out \"On my way!\" \nHere's how to do both. How to turn off auto-correct completely Todd Haselton | CNBC How to turn off auto-correct on your iPhone \nTake note: This means your iPhone won't auto-correct any typos you make, so you might see your number of mistakes increase. To turn off auto-correct: Open Settings on your iPhone Tap General Toggle the option for \"auto-correction\" so that it's off. How to adjust auto-correct manually: Todd Haselton | CNBC How to replace one word with another word on your iPhone \nThis option lets you replace words that you type with others. If, for example, you want to replace \"ducking\" with a naughtier word, you can do that here: Open Settings on your iPhone Tap General Choose \"Text Replacement\" Tap the + button in the top-right corner \nHere, to be appropriate, we'll create the phrase \"be right there\" and use the shortcut \"brt.\" This lets you type \"brt\" and automatically expand that into \"be right there\" when you're sending a text message or e-mail. \nYou could also make \"ducking\" the shortcut and change the phrase to the word you're probably actually trying to type. This means every time your phone thinks you type \"ducking\" it'll put the other word in its place. \nThat's it. Create as many text replacement phrases as you want, especially if you want to turn off auto-correct altogether and use this list to replace typos you know you frequently make.
