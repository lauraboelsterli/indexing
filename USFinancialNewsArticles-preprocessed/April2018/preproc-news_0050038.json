    "text": "Sean Gallup | Getty Images A worker walks among rolls of semi-finished aluminum at an Alcoa aluminum factory. \nAlcoa shares dropped Monday after the U.S. Treasury Department issued a six-month reprieve on sanctions levied against a top Russian aluminum competitor. \nIts stock fell more than 14 percent after the department said it would give Americans until October to wind down transactions with Rusal. The extension was granted, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, to give the department time to review its penalties on the company. \nAluminum prices also fell. \n\"Rusal has felt the impact of U.S. sanctions because of its entanglement with Oleg Deripaska, but the U.S. government is not targeting the hardworking people who depend on Rusal and its subsidiaries,\" Mnuchin said in a statement Monday. show chapters",
