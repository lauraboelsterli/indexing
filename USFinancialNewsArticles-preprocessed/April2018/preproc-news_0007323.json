Our customer count is subject to ongoing adjustment and, when adjustments occur, previously disclosed numbers of customers are updated to allow for comparability.\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements in this press release that are not historical in nature are forward-looking statements that, within the meaning of the federal securities laws including the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Words such as \"may\", \"will\", \"expect\", \"intend\", \"plan\", \"believe\", \"seek\", \"could\", \"estimate\", \"judgment\", \"targeting\", \"should\", \"anticipate\", \"goal\" and variations of these words and similar expressions, are also intended to identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this press release address a variety of subjects, including our belief that the enterprise machine learning and analytics market will quickly emerge and that we will continue to lead its direction through technology and product innovation, our expectation that we will continue our momentum in machine learning, analytics and the cloud, and our \"Business Outlook\" for our first quarter of fiscal 2019 and full year fiscal 2019 operating results. Readers are cautioned that actual results could differ materially from those implied by such forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including global economic conditions, competitive pressures and pricing declines, intellectual property infringement claims, and other risks or uncertainties that are described under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our most recently filed Quarterly Report on Form 10â€‘Q filed with the SEC on December 8, 2017, and in our other SEC filings. Although we believe the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurances that our expectations will be attained. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe report all financial information required in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). To supplement our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the results of our operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used by us include non-GAAP subscription gross margins, non-GAAP loss from operations, non-GAAP net loss, and historical and forward-looking non-GAAP net loss per share. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation, acquisition- and disposition-related expenses (if any), amortization of acquired intangible assets, and donations of common stock made to the Cloudera Foundation from the Cloudera unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations. In addition, we use non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding to calculate non-GAAP net loss per share.\nFor a description of these items, including the reasons why management adjusts for them, and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\" as well as the related tables that precede it. We may consider whether other significant non-recurring items that arise in the future should also be excluded in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures we use.\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our core business, operating results or future outlook. Management uses, and believes that investors benefit from referring to, these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results, as well as when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. We use these nonâ€‘GAAP financial measures in conjunction with traditional GAAP measures to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate comparisons of our performance to prior periods.\nCloudera, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended January 31,\nYear Ended January 31,\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nRevenue:\nSubscription\n$\n84,260\n$\n56,159\n$\n301,022\n$\n200,252\nServices\n19,190\n16,668\n66,421\n60,774\nTotal revenue\n103,450\n72,827\n367,443\n261,026\nCost of revenue: (1) (2)\nSubscription\n14,729\n9,860\n70,902\n38,704\nServices\n18,098\n12,315\n87,133\n48,284\nTotal cost of revenue\n32,827\n22,175\n158,035\n86,988\nGross profit\n70,623\n50,652\n209,408\n174,038\nOperating expenses: (1) (2) (3)\nResearch and development\n38,925\n25,191\n215,695\n102,309\nSales and marketing\n61,828\n55,911\n298,467\n203,161\nGeneral and administrative\n15,548\n30,598\n85,539\n55,907\nTotal operating expenses\n116,301\n111,700\n599,701\n361,377\nLoss from operations\n(45,678)\n(61,048)\n(390,293)\n(187,339)\nInterest income, net\n1,560\n613\n5,150\n2,756\nOther income (expense), net\n1,080\n(236)\n1,429\n(547)\nNet loss before provision for income taxes\n(43,038)\n(60,671)\n(383,714)\n(185,130)\nProvision for income taxes\n(869)\n(761)\n(2,079)\n(2,187)\nNet loss\n$\n(43,907)\n$\n(61,432)\n$\n(385,793)\n$\n(187,317)\nNet loss per share, basic and diluted\n$\n(0.31)\n$\n(1.67)\n$\n(3.38)\n$\n(5.15)\nWeighted-average shares used in computing net loss per share, basic and diluted\n142,857\n36,836\n114,141\n36,406\n(1) Amounts include stockâ€‘based compensation expense as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended January 31,\nYear Ended January 31,\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nCost of revenue â€“ subscription\n$\n2,683\n$\n375\n$\n24,826\n$\n1,426\nCost of revenue â€“ services\n3,429\n440\n31,843\n1,803\nResearch and development\n10,004\n1,280\n100,143\n5,606\nSales and marketing\n7,672\n1,261\n90,420\n5,757\nGeneral and administrative\n4,538\n1,800\n42,774\n7,122\nTotal stockâ€‘based compensation expense\n$\n28,326\n$\n5,156\n$\n290,006\n$\n21,714\n(2) Amounts include amortization of acquired intangible assets as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended January 31,\nYear Ended January 31,\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nCost of revenue â€“ subscription\n$\n622\n$\n514\n$\n2,230\n$\n1,997\nSales and marketing\n178\n431\n1,493\n1,723\nTotal amortization of acquired intangible assets\n$\n800\n$\n945\n$\n3,723\n$\n3,720\n(3) In January 2017, we donated 1,175,063 shares of common stock to the Cloudera Foundation.

Financial Measures\" above, which are generally applicable to each of the items Cloudera excludes from its non-GAAP financial measures, Cloudera believes it is appropriate to exclude or give effect to certain items for the following reasons:\nStock-based compensation expense. We exclude stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP financial measures consistent with how we evaluate our operating results and prepare our operating plans, forecasts and budgets. Further, when considering the impact of equity award grants, we focus on overall stockholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with such equity grants. The exclusion of the expense facilitates the comparison of results and business outlook for future periods with results for prior periods in order to better understand the long term performance of our business. Amortization of acquired intangible assets. We exclude the amortization of acquired intangible assets from our non-GAAP financial measures. Although the purchase accounting for an acquisition necessarily reflects the accounting value assigned to intangible assets, our management team excludes the GAAP impact of acquired intangible assets when evaluating our operating results. Likewise, our management team excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets from our operating plans, forecasts and budgets. The exclusion of the expense facilitates the comparison of results and business outlook for future periods with results for prior periods in order to better understand the long term performance of our business. Donation of common stock to the Cloudera Foundation. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we issued 1,175,063 shares of common stock to the Cloudera Foundation for no consideration. This resulted in a oneâ€‘time nonâ€‘cash charge of $21.6 million, which was recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations. Our management team does not consider this expense when evaluating our operating performance and we do not expect to make future grants of shares to the Cloudera Foundation and therefore consider this charge nonâ€‘recurring and exclude the GAAP impact of the donation when evaluating our operating results. The exclusion of the expense facilitates the comparison of results and business outlook for future periods with results for prior periods in order to better understand the longâ€‘term performance of our business. Assumed preferred stock conversion. For periods prior to the closing of our initial public offering (IPO) on May 3, 2017, we give effect to the automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of preferred stock to common stock, as if such conversion had occurred at the beginning of the period, in our calculations of non-GAAP weighted-average shares, diluted, and non-GAAP net loss per share, diluted. The inclusion of these shares facilitates the comparison of results and business outlook for future periods with results for prior periods in order to better understand the long term performance of our business. Assumed IPO issuance. We include the common shares issued in our IPO, on a weighted basis, as if the shares were issued on the date of our effectiveness. Our IPO was effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and closed in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.\nCloudera, Inc.\nReconciliation of non-GAAP Financial Guidance\n(unaudited)\nFiscal 2019\n(in millions)\nQ1\nFY\nGAAP net loss\n($58) - (55)\n($213) - (209)\nStock-based compensation expense (1)\n29\n116\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\n1\n3\nNon-GAAP net loss\n($28) - (25)\n($94) - (90)\n(1) Stock-based compensation expense is impacted by variables such as stock price and employee behavior, each of which are inherently difficult to forecast.
