REUTERS/Eric Thayer “I haven’t seen clear indication yet that we needed to pass something to keep him from being removed, because I don’t think that’s going to happen,” McConnell told reporters. “And that remains my view, that I don’t think he’s going to be removed from this office.”\nReporting by Makini Brice and Lisa Lambert; Writing by Tim Ahmann; Editing by Mohammad Zargham\n ",
