    "text": "BEIJING, April 20 (Reuters) - China will launch its first spot real-time electricity markets in eight regions, the National Energy Administration (NEA) said on Friday as Beijing accelerates its efforts to liberalise power prices, which are currently set by the government.\nIn a draft rule, the NEA outlined guidelines for eight regions to set up real-time trading platforms that will set prices for the cash market as well as those for one-day ahead, allowing power generators, industrial users and distributors to trade power in real time.\nReporting by Muyu Xu and Josephine Mason; Editing by Christian Schmollinger\n ",
