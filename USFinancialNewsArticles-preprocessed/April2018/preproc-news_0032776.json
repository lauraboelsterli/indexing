Slideshow (5 Images) \n“I wanted to make changes bearing in mind where we have come from and that we have a final coming up,” said Barca coach Valverde, who was blamed after the shock exit to AS Roma in the Champions League quarter-finals for not rotating his squad more. \n“When you make many changes you are taking a lot of risks but tonight I thought it was the right moment to assume those risks,” he said. \nThe point means Barca can guarantee lifting the title if they win their next games at Deportivo La Coruna and Real Madrid but they could wrap up a 25th Liga crown before then if Atletico Madrid lose their next two against Real Sociedad and Real Betis. \n“We don’t take this draw as a good thing as we always want to win but we have to accept what we have,” Valverde added. \n“It was an end-to-end game but just as we were at our best we had the sending off and we had to reshape ourselves. It’s another point and now we need two more victories to become champions.” \nBarca’s King’s Cup final opponents Sevilla, who are seventh, were held to a 0-0 draw at relegation-threatened Deportivo earlier on Tuesday, while sixth-placed Villarreal beat Leganes 2-1 as they battle for a Europa League qualifying spot.
