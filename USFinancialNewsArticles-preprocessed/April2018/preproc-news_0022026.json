    "text": "MCLEAN, Va., April 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gladstone Capital Corporation (NASDAQ:GLAD) (the “Company”) today announced that on April 10, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), including a “required majority” (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”)) of the Board, approved the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the Small Business Credit Availability Act. As a result, the Company’s asset coverage requirements for senior securities will be changed from 200% to 150%, effective one year after the approval date, April 10, 2019.\nComments from Gladstone Capital Corporation’s President, Bob Marcotte: “We welcome the recent business development company legislation and today’s Board approval, which will strengthen our flexibility to execute on our lower middle market credit investment strategy over the long-term. Building on the strong returns we delivered in 2017 and the performance of our investments made in the last 5 years, which have generated net realized and unrealized gains, we intend to maintain our investment strategy and disciplined approach to loan originations.\n“As an active provider of secured debt to the lower middle market, we continue to see attractive investment opportunities. We believe the prudent deployment of this additional capacity will enhance our portfolio diversity, lower our risk profile, and expand our capital market access options, while positioning us to further improve overall returns for the benefit of our shareholders. We believe this is a very positive development and look forward to detailing how we intend to implement this increased financing flexibility in the coming quarters.”\nAbout Gladstone Capital Corporation: Gladstone Capital Corporation is a publicly traded business development company that invests in debt and equity securities, consisting primarily of secured first and second lien term loans to lower middle market businesses in the United States.
