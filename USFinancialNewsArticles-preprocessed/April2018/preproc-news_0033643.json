    "text": "April 19, 2018 / 10:10 AM / Updated 14 minutes ago Queen backs her son Charles to take on Commonwealth role Reuters Staff 2   Queen Elizabeth said on Thursday that she hoped her son and heir Prince Charles would take on leadership of the Commonwealth, answering some who argue the position should be rotated around member states. Britain's Queen Elizabeth speaks at the formal opening of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in the ballroom at Buckingham Palace in London, Britain, April 19, 2018. Yui Mok/Pool via Reuters \n“It is my sincere wish that the Commonwealth will continue to offer stability and continuity for future generations and will decide that one day the Prince of Wales should carry on the important work started by my father in 1949,” the queen said at the formal opening of the Commonwealth heads of Government Meeting. \nThe meeting, taking place in London for the first time in 20 years, is seen as a chance for Britain to reconnect with its former colonies and revitalise the loose alliance of 53 Commonwealth countries ahead of Brexit. \nThe Commonwealth evolved out of the British empire in the mid-20th century, and the Queen has been its head since her reign began in 1952. Slideshow (5 Images) \nThe question of who will follow Britain’s 91 year-old monarch into the role was raised in the run up to the summit. The leader of Britain’s opposition party suggested on Sunday the position should be rotated around the members. \nPrime minister Theresa May also spoke at the opening ceremony and paid glowing tribute to the queen’s “service, dedication and constancy” in the role. May will lobby for Charles to be the queen’s successor when the issue is discussed over the next two days. \nPrince Charles, 69, also made an informal pitch for the role in his remarks at the event in Buckingham Palace: “For my part, the Commonwealth has been a fundamental feature of my life for as long as I can remember.” Reporting by William James, editing by Estelle Shirbon",
