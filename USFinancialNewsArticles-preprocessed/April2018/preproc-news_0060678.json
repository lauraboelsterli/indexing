Soccer Football - Serie A - Chievo Verona vs Napoli - Marcantonio Bentegodi, Verona, Italy - November 5, 2017 Chievo Verona coach Rolando Maran REUTERS/Ciro De Luca\nChievo have won only two matches since the start of the year and are two points and one place above the drop zone following their 4-1 defeat at AS Roma on Saturday.\n“Chievo announce that Rolando Maran has been relieved of his duties as coach of the first team,” said a statement on the Verona-based club’s website.\n“We thank Maran for the work which he has undertaken with effort, reliability and professionalism from the first day.”\nYouth team coach Lorenzo D’Anna will replace Maran for the rest of the season, the club said.\nMaran, the 10th coaching victim of the Serie A season, had been in charge for three-and-a-half years.\nUnder his leadership, Chievo twice finished in the lower half of the table but comfortably avoided relegation and were ninth in the other season.\nOriginally a small club from the Verona suburb of the same name, Chievo reached the top tier for the first time in 2001, earning them the nickname the Flying Donkeys.\nFans of Verona, the city’s biggest club, never took Chievo seriously and had claimed that donkeys would fly before their smaller neighbours reached the top flight.
