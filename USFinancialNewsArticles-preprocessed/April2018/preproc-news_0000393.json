    "text": "COLUMBUS, OH, April 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nIntellinetics, Inc. ( OTCQB: INLX ), a cloud-based document solutions provider, announced financial results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nYear End Financial Highlights\n● Total Revenue up 1% from 2016. ● Software as a Service Revenue increased 19% from 2016. ● Net Loss decrease of $216,974 from 2016. ● Adjusted EBITDA Loss of $884,749, an improvement of 3% from 2016. Summary – Year-End Results\nRevenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $2,623,441 as compared with $2,601,733 for the same period in 2016. Intellinetics reported a net loss of $(1,359,337) and $(1,576,311) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing a decrease (improvement) of $216,974. Net Loss in 2017 includes a $419,090 one-time gain on retirement of debt. Net loss per share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was ($0.08) and ($0.09), respectively.\nJames F. DeSocio , President & CEO of Intellinetics, stated, “We have begun implementation of our strategy focusing a core group of customers in the Human Services Provider space. We have a unique and differentiated product value proposition, including auditing, compliance and reporting. We have reallocated resources within the company to support this strategy, while at the same time investing in select tools to assist us in demand and lead generation, which will allow us to better control our destiny. These steps are essential for us to scale and grow.”\n“Looking forward, we plan on reaping the rewards of these focused initiatives during 2018 and beyond. As we continue to focus on increasing our SaaS-based revenues we recognize that short-term revenue recognition on subscription services is generally lower than upfront premise license sales and that the new programs will take some months to bear fruit. We believe this investment and strategic focus will provide greater revenue consistency, higher growth, and deliver the best long-term value to shareholders,” DeSocio concluded.\n2017 Highlights\n● Hired lead generation expert to assist in creating and driving new outbound mailing campaigns. ● Built new content, white papers, case studies, fact sheets, and updated web site to reflect our solutions-focused message for our targeted verticals. ● Developed targeted email campaign process for our primary target industries. ● Educated partner channel with new strategy, and supported “through partner” marketing efforts.

The forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, the risks associated with the effect of changing economic conditions, trends in the products markets, variations in Intellinetics’ cash flow or adequacy of capital resources, market acceptance risks, the success of Intellinetics’ channel partners and distribution partners, technical development risks, and other risks and uncertainties discussed in Intellinetics’ most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed Form 10-Qs and Form 8-Ks.

Expanded and historical information is made available to the public by Intellinetics on its website at www.intellinetics.com or at www.sec.gov .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure\nIntellinetics uses non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).\nA non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows of a company. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or a measure of our liquidity. Intellinetics urges investors to review the reconciliation of non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to the comparable GAAP Net Loss, which is included in this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Intellinetics’ financial performance.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful performance measure and is used by us to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period-to-period and to provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than measures under GAAP can provide alone. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as earnings before interest expense, any income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, and other non-cash expenses such as share-based compensation, note conversion warrant expense and other financing related transaction costs.\nReconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Net loss - GAAP $ (1,359,337 ) $ (1,576,311 ) Interest expense, net 609,851 206,332 Depreciation and amortization 11,831 10,687 Share-based compensation 219,045 200,378 Note issue/conversion warrant expense 52,951 235,405 Note conversion underwriting expense 0 13,603 Gain on retirement of debt (419,090 ) 0 Adjusted EBITDA $ (884,749 ) $ (909,906 )\nINTELLINETICS, INC. and SUBSIDIARY\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Revenues: Sale of software $ 452,238 $ 390,583 Software as a service 625,557 525,282 Software maintenance services 966,011 988,690 Professional services 451,628 502,952 Third Party services 128,007 194,226 Total revenues 2,623,441 2,601,733 Cost of revenues: Sale of software 97,899 73,566 Software as a service 304,512 247,928 Software maintenance services 120,422 127,805 Professional services 198,133 135,486 Third Party services 39,496 125,024 Total cost of revenues 760,462 709,809 Gross profit 1,862,979 1,891,924 Operating expenses: General and administrative 2,199,904 2,118,924 Sales and marketing 819,820 1,132,292 Depreciation 11,831 10,687 Total operating expenses 3,031,555 3,261,903 Loss from operations (1,168,576 ) (1,369,979 ) Other income (expense) Gain on retirement of debt 419,090 - Interest expense, net (609,851 ) (206,332 ) Total other income (expense) (190,761 ) (206,332 ) Net loss $ (1,359,337 ) $ (1,576,311 ) Basic and diluted net loss per share: $ (0.08 ) $ (0.09 ) Weighted average number of common shares outstanding - basic and diluted 17,372,595 16,650,085\nINTELLINETICS, INC. and SUBSIDIARY\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nDecember 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 ASSETS Current assets: Cash $ 1,125,921 $ 689,946 Accounts receivable, net 295,815 259,497 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 162,450 150,620 Total current assets 1,584,186 1,100,063 Property and equipment, net 14,760 18,783 Other assets 10,284 10,285 Total assets $ 1,609,230 $ 1,129,131 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT Current liabilities: Accounts payable and accrued expenses $ 471,200 $ 767,197 Deferred revenues 703,971 665,460 Deferred compensation 213,166 215,012 Notes payable - current 875,000 360,496 Notes payable - related party - current 416,969 38,307 Total current liabilities 2,680,306 2,046,472 Long-term liabilities: Notes payable - net of current portion 1,221,384 585,782 Notes payable - related party - net of current portion 312,680 299,447 Deferred interest expense - 158,062 Other long-term liabilities - related parties 29,997 1,125 Total long-term liabilities 1,564,061 1,044,416 Total liabilities 4,244,367 3,090,888 Stockholders’ deficit: Common stock, $0.001 par value, 50,000,000 shares authorized;
