    "text": "April 12, 2018 / 6:35 AM / Updated 20 minutes ago 'Beast from the East' drags on British pub firm Greene King's sales Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Pub operator Greene King Plc ( GNK.L ) reported a 1.8 percent drop in like-for-like sales for the 49 weeks to April 8 on Thursday, joining a string of British businesses that took a hit from the cold wave in the UK during February-March. FILE PHOTO: A Greene King beer pump and pint of beer are seen in a pub in central London July 2, 2008. REUTERS/Luke MacGregor \nThe owner of ale brands such as Greene King IPA, Old Speckled Hen and Abbot Ale said weather over the last 12 weeks impacted trading. \nThe weather system dubbed “the Beast from the East” brought rare snow and sub-zero temperatures to much of Britain in late February and early March bringing normal life to a standstill. \nOn an underlying basis, excluding the impact of snow, comparable sales in the year-to-date were 1.2 lower, Greene King said.
