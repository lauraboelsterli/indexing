Formula One - F1 - Azerbaijan Grand Prix - Baku City Circuit, Baku, Azerbaijan - April 26, 2018 Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes ahead of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix REUTERS/David Mdzinarishvili\n“I’ve had the privilege of meeting him a couple of times,” the Briton told Sky Sports television at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix.\n“He asked me to go and train with the team, which I have not managed to do yet, but he was always really welcoming and it was cool to meet ‘our team’s’ boss.”\nHamilton, who said he had supported Arsenal since he was five, admired Wenger’s commitment to the North London club over more than two decades.\n“The loyalty which he has shown through all the ups and downs, through outside individuals saying positives and negatives, but to stay true to your values and continue to strive for what you believe in I think has really been awesome,” he said.
