    "text": "ORLANDO, Fla., April 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Kustom US (Kustom), one of the leading property restoration companies in North America, is pleased to announce that Sarah Try has been promoted to Executive Vice President. Try, based out of Kustom's Orlando headquarter offices, will serve as the firm's executive leader for all corporate Financial and Administrative functions.\n\"Sarah's discipline to learn and hunger to succeed is why she deserves this promotion,\" says Andrew Zavodney, Kustom President and CEO. \"She's a highly engaged leader, solution-driven, and one of the most loyal employees I've ever met. It is an honor to call her Kustom's newest EVP.\"\n\"Andrew, along with the entire Kustom family have always provided me with the opportunity to take on new responsibilities and greater challenges,\" says Sarah. \"I am beyond thankful for the opportunity and look forward to being an integral part of Kustom's strategic growth.\"\nIn her new role within Kustom, Try will lead corporate team members who will directly report to her. She'll also manage several key departments, which total over 100 staff members.\nSarah began her career working for the Ohio Department of Transportation which helped propel her career in the construction industry. She then began working for a local excavating company. It was there that Sarah met Andrew, who at the time was the firm's co-owner.\nOnce he realized the positive influence and innate ability to lead her team, Andrew made the decision to bring Try on full-time with Kustom before Kustom's official move to Orlando, Florida.\nTry, a native of Ohio, coaches a Ruth Buddy Ball team, which is a baseball league for children with special needs in her free time.\nAbout Kustom US\nFounded in 1968 by Andrew Zavodney, Kustom US ( www.kustom.us ) is a nationally acclaimed and industry-leading property restoration firm that provides unparalleled services to local, regional and national clients.
