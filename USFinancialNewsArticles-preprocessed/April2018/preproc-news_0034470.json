    "text": "(Adds updated stock price, details from Electrek report, Musk quotes)\nApril 17 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc is aiming to produce 6,000 Model 3 cars per week by the end of June to reach its weekly production target of 5,000 after accounting for a margin of error, automotive news website Electrek reported https://electrek.co/2018/04/17/tesla-model-3-production-goal-6000-units-per-week on Tuesday.\nThe news comes a day after Tesla temporarily suspended its Model 3 assembly line in what the company said was a planned production pause.\nThe pause the second since February was meant to improve automation and systematically address bottlenecks to increase production, a regular move by car companies, Tesla said on Monday.\n\"We will be stopping for three to five days to do a comprehensive set of upgrades. This should set us up for Model 3 production of 3,000 to 4,000 per week next month,\" Electrek quoted Tesla CEO Elon Musk as saying in a letter to employees.\n\"Another set of upgrades starting in late May should be enough to unlock production capacity of 6,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of June,\" Musk added in the letter, according to Electrek.\nTesla did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.\nIn order to achieve the 6,000-unit target, all Model 3 production at Tesla's Fremont, California factory will move to 24/7 operations, Musk reportedly said.\nAny Tesla department or suppliers that misses the target will need to have a \"very good explanation,\" along with a plan for fixing the problem, Musk was quoted saying in the letter.\nShares of Tesla, which ended 1.2 percent lower on Tuesday, rose 1.4 percent in after-hours trading.
