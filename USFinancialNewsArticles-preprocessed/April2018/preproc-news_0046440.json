    "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union’s foreign affairs chief said on Saturday that North Korea’s announcement to stop nuclear tests was a positive step and called for an “irreversible denuclearisation” of the Asian country.\nEuropean Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini arrives at a European Union leaders summit in Brussels, Belgium, March 22, 2018. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir North Korean state media said earlier on Saturday the country would immediately suspend nuclear and missile tests and scrap its nuclear test site.\nThe North Korean move “is a positive, long sought-after step on the path that has now to lead to the country’s complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation,” Federica Mogherini said in a statement.\nNorth Korean state media Quote: d the leader Kim Jong Un as saying that the country no longer needed to conduct nuclear tests or intercontinental ballistic missile tests because it had completed its goal of developing nuclear weapons.\nThe announcement was made before Kim Jong Un’s planned summits with South Korean President Moon Jae-in next week and with U.S. President Donald Trump in late May or early June.\nMogherini said the two forthcoming summits were opportunities “to build confidence and bring about additional, concrete and positive outcomes.”\nShe offered EU support to the talks “in any way possible, including through sharing our own experience of negotiations for denuclearisation.”\nMogherini said the EU position on North Korea remained at this stage unchanged, combining sanctions with open communication channels.\nReporting by Francesco Guarascio, Editing by Alexander Smith, William Maclean\n 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
