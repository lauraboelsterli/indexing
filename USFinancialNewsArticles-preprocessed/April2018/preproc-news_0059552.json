    "text": "SPOKANE, Wash., April 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Avista’s (NYSE:AVA) electric and natural gas general rate cases have concluded, with an order issued by the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (Commission or UTC). The Commission approved one-time electric and natural gas rate adjustments which will take effect May 1, 2018.\nThe Commission’s order approved electric rates designed to increase annual billed revenues by $10.8 million, or 2.1 percent and natural gas rates designed to decrease annual billed revenues by $2.1 million, or 1.6 percent. These revenues include the return to customers through base rates of approximately $26.9 million for electric service, and $5.5 million for natural gas service, as a result of the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which went into effect on Jan. 1, 2018.\nThe Commission’s decision reflects a 9.5 percent return on equity (ROE) and a 48.5 percent equity layer. The rate of return is 7.50 percent.\n“The Commission’s order allows us the opportunity to earn a fair return in 2018 and provides cost recovery for a portion of the capital projects in our request that are now serving our customers,” Avista Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Scott L. Morris said. “We’re also pleased to be able to return to our customers benefits resulting from the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act through their rates.”\n“As we look ahead, we will consider the appropriate approach for future cost recovery. Right now we will stay focused on the current matters before the Commission. As these are resolved, we will engage with the Commission, Staff and other parties in an effort to better align expectations regarding Avista’s ongoing capital investments prior to filing future general rate cases,” Morris said.\nIn its order, the Commission recognized changes in power supply contracts and made adjustments in the approved electric revenue increases that account for these changes.\nAvista anticipates issuing 2018 earnings guidance during the first quarter 2018 earnings call on May 2, 2018.\nResidential Customer Bills\nOverall, as a result of the Commission’s order, customers will see the following changes to their bills beginning May 1, 2018:\nA residential electric customer using an average of 938 kilowatt hours per month will see a bill increase of $1.87 or 2.2 percent for a revised monthly bill of $88.45. A residential natural gas customer using an average of 65 therms per month will see a bill decrease of $0.77 or 1.5 percent for a revised monthly bill of $52.03.\nThe actual percentage increase for electric customers and decrease for natural gas customers would depend on how much energy a customer uses.\nAvista serves more than 246,000 electric and nearly 156,800 natural gas customers in Washington.\nCustomer Resources\nTo assist customers in managing their energy bills, Avista offers services for customers such as comfort level billing, payment arrangements and Customer Assistance Referral and Evaluation Services (CARES), which provide assistance to special-needs customers through referrals to area agencies and churches for help with housing, utilities, medical assistance and other needs. Avista also provides funding for energy assistance programs Project Share and the company’s Low Income Rate Assistance Program, which are administered through community action agencies.\nAvista provides energy efficiency and outreach programs that include rebates and incentives as well as tips and resources to help customers manage their energy use and energy bills.
