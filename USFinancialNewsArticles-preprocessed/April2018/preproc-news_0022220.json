    "text": "April 11, 2018 / 12:47 PM / Updated an hour ago Bipartisan group of senators introduce proposal to protect Mueller Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of senators will introduce legislation on Wednesday to protect the office of the special counsel, one day after the White House said U.S. President Donald Trump had the authority to fire a special prosecutor investigating Russia and the 2016 election. \nRobert Mueller, the special counsel, is probing allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, an investigation that has widened to include whether the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow. \nRussia has denied that it interfered in the election, and Trump and the White House say there was no collusion. Nevertheless, the probe has become a thorny issue for the president. \nAfter the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided the offices of Trump’s personal lawyer on Monday, based partly on a referral by Mueller, Trump called the investigation “a disgrace” and suggested he may consider firing the special counsel. \nOn Wednesday, four senators announced they would merge two different proposals to protect the office of the special counsel. The original bills were introduced last summer. \nIf passed, the legislation would allow the special counsel to be fired only “for good cause” by a senior Justice Department official, with a reason given in writing; provide recourse if the special counsel was fired without good cause; and preserve the staffing and materials of a pending investigation. \n“We need to ensure not only that Special Counsel Mueller can complete his work without interference, but that special counsels in future investigations can, too,” Democratic Senator Chris Coons, one of the sponsors of the bill, said in a statement. Related Coverage Nationwide protests planned if Trump fires Mueller or Rosenstein \nIt was unclear whether the proposed law would pass. \nOn Tuesday, the Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said that while he thought Mueller should be allowed to continue his probe, he did not think legislation to protect him was necessary. \nMcConnell’s spokesperson declined to comment on Wednesday. \nIt also remains unclear whether the proposal could pass the House or that Trump would approve it. \nSpokespeople for McConnell and the White House did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comments. Special Counsel Robert Mueller departs after briefing members of the U.S. Senate on his investigation into potential collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 21, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts \nHowever, Coons said in an interview with MSNBC that he thought some Republicans, who currently have the majority in the Senate, could be swayed to back the bill. \n“I think the events of the past week have changed some minds in the Republican caucus, that there is a moment here for the Senate to stand up and save the president from himself,” said Coons.
