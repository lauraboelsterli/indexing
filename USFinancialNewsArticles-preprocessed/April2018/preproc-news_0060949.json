    "text": "Edgar Su | Reuters Google employee at a recreational area\nWhen it comes to employee perks, Google has long been seen as the crème de la crème. However, more companies have upped their benefits game in an effort to attract top talent.\nMillennials entering the workforce today are lured with perks that were unheard of years ago, including pet insurance and paid time off to volunteer.\nAlthough Google may have started this trend, many others have followed suit. Here are five companies with perks that rival Google's: 1. Facebook\nThe social media giant offers interns free housing and shuttles to and from work, so they don't have to pay for gas, Glassdoor reports.\nFacebook , which was voted Glassdoor's 2018 best place to work , also offers free meals, fun work spaces , company-wide social events, and reimbursement for some babysitting services . 2. Boxed\nChieh Huang, CEO of the household goods and grocery e-tailer, made headlines in 2016 when he offered to pay up to $20,000 for employees' weddings . Today, this is now a company policy for all full-time employees.\nThe company also covers four years of college tuition for the children of employees, excluding room, board and books. 3. Netflix\nThe streaming service offers employees up to one year of parental leave after a child's birth or adoption. While on leave, workers receive their normal pay.\nNetflix also has an unlimited vacation policy and does not track time off, according to a company spokesperson. 4. Goldman Sachs\nWhile they may work grueling hours, Goldman Sachs employees are given ample opportunities to unwind. The bank offers daily pilates and tai chi, bubble tea in the cafeteria and an all-night scavenger hunt , according to Time . Getty Images Financial professionals sit in the Goldman Sachs booth on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.\nThe company also provides on-site childcare, student loan debt repayment help and will cover the tab for gender reassignment surgery . 5. Amazon\nThe retail giant offers 20 weeks of paid parental leave and even pays for its employees' spouses who do not work at the company to take time off.",
