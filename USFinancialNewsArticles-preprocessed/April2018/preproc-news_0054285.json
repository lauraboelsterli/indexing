    "text": "THE WOODLANDS, Texas, April 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Newpark Resources, Inc. (NYSE: NR) today announced results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Total revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $227.3 million compared to $204.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $158.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $7.2 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared to $7.9 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017, and a loss from continuing operations of $(1.0) million, or $(0.01) per share, in the first quarter of 2017.\nPaul Howes, Newpark's President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"We're very pleased to report another solid quarter for both segments, posting consolidated revenues of $227 million and operating income of $14 million in the first quarter. In Fluids, first quarter revenues were $177 million, reflecting our highest quarterly revenue achieved since 2014. The 9% sequential growth in revenues was largely driven by the seasonal strength in Canada, which contributed $9 million of sequential revenue growth, while our U.S. business tracked fairly in-line with market activity levels. Internationally, despite the anticipated pull-back in Brazil, revenues increased by 5%, benefitting from strength in Romania and Kuwait, as well as the start-up of the Woodside project in offshore Australia.\n\"Meanwhile, following the successful deployment of our Kronos system with an independent operator in the Gulf of Mexico in the first quarter, I'm pleased to report that the system is now being utilized by two additional customers, including the Woodside Greater Enfield project in offshore Australia, as well as our first full deepwater well in the Gulf of Mexico with an IOC,\" added Howes.\n\"In the Mats business, the integration of the Well Service Group and Utility Access Solutions with our legacy rental and service business is producing solid results. The mats segment generated revenues of $50 million in the first quarter, reflecting a fairly balanced revenue mix between exploration and non-exploration markets,\" added Howes. \"Revenues from mat sales came in at $10 million for the quarter, and we are optimistic going forward about the strengthening demand that we are seeing across end-markets.\"\nFluids Systems International Contract Update\nIn Algeria, Newpark currently provides drilling fluids and related services to Sonatrach under Lot 1 and Lot 3 of a three-year contract awarded in 2015 (\"2015 Contract\"). Work under this contract began in the second quarter of 2015 and is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2018. During the first quarter of 2018, Sonatrach initiated a new tender (\"2018 Tender\"), for a three-year term succeeding the 2015 Contract. For the 2018 Tender, Sonatrach adopted a change in its procurement process, limiting the number of Lots that could be awarded to major service providers. As a consequence, we expect any new award under the 2018 Tender will result in lower revenues from Sonatrach. Based upon preliminary communication regarding the tender process, the Company currently expects that revenue from Sonatrach under the 2018 Tender will approximate $125 million over the three-year term, which would result in a reduction of approximately $25 million per year as compared to the recent activity levels. The awards under the 2018 Tender are anticipated to be finalized in the second quarter of 2018, although there are no assurances that the Company will receive a new contract. The impact of the new award could begin as early as the fourth quarter of 2018, as work transitions from the 2015 Contract to the final contract awarded under the 2018 Tender.\nSegment Results\nThe Fluids Systems segment generated revenues of $177.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $162.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $136.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Segment operating income was $10.5 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $7.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $6.4 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Mats and Integrated Services segment generated revenues of $49.9 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $42.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $22.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. Segment operating income was $12.1 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $11.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $6.4 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nConference Call\nNewpark has scheduled a conference call to discuss first quarter 2018 results and near-term operational outlook, which will be broadcast live over the Internet, on Friday, April 27, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time / 9:00 a.m. Central Time.

Such financial measures include earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"), EBITDA Margin, Net Debt and the Ratio of Net Debt to Capital.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors, securities analysts and other parties in the evaluation of our performance and/or that of other companies in our industry. In addition, management uses these measures to evaluate operating performance, and our incentive compensation plan measures performance based on our consolidated EBITDA, along with other factors. The methods we use to produce these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from methods used by other companies. These measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nConsolidated\nThree Months Ended\n(In thousands)\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2017\nNet income (loss) (GAAP)\n$\n7,222\n$\n(9,450)\n$\n(983)\nLoss from disposal of discontinued operations, net of tax\n—\n17,367\n—\nInterest expense, net\n3,300\n3,028\n3,218\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n3,091\n(2,056)\n1,119\nDepreciation and amortization\n11,271\n10,759\n9,387\nEBITDA (non-GAAP)\n$\n24,884\n$\n19,648\n$\n12,741\nFluids Systems\nThree Months Ended\n(In thousands)\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2017\nOperating income (GAAP)\n$\n10,477\n$\n7,435\n$\n6,352\nDepreciation and amortization\n5,290\n5,344\n5,168\nEBITDA (non-GAAP)\n15,767\n12,779\n11,520\nRevenues\n177,379\n162,404\n136,050\nOperating Margin (GAAP)\n5.9\n%\n4.6\n%\n4.7\n%\nEBITDA Margin (non-GAAP)\n8.9\n%\n7.9\n%\n8.5\n%\nMats and Integrated Services\nThree Months Ended\n(In thousands)\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2017\nOperating income (GAAP)\n$\n12,086\n$\n11,729\n$\n6,402\nDepreciation and amortization\n5,114\n4,578\n3,480\nEBITDA (non-GAAP)\n17,200\n16,307\n9,882\nRevenues\n49,914\n41,985\n22,641\nOperating Margin (GAAP)\n24.2\n%\n27.9\n%\n28.3\n%\nEBITDA Margin (non-GAAP)\n34.5\n%\n38.8\n%\n43.6\n%\nNewpark Resources, Inc.\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\nRatio of Net Debt to Capital\nThe following table reconciles the Company's ratio of total debt to capital calculated in accordance with GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measure of the Company's ratio of net debt to capital:\n(In thousands)\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nCurrent debt\n$\n1,391\n$\n1,518\nLong-term debt, less current portion\n185,635\n158,957\nTotal Debt\n187,026\n160,475\nTotal stockholders' equity\n550,215\n547,480\nTotal Capital\n$\n737,241\n$\n707,955\nRatio of Total Debt to Capital\n25.4\n%\n22.7\n%\nTotal Debt\n$\n187,026\n$\n160,475\nLess: cash\n(59,938)\n(56,352)\nNet Debt\n127,088\n104,123\nTotal stockholders' equity\n550,215\n547,480\nTotal Capital, Net of Cash\n$\n677,303\n$\n651,603\nRatio of Net Debt to Capital\n18.8\n%\n16.0\n%\nContacts:\nGregg Piontek\nSenior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nNewpark Resources, Inc.\ngpiontek@newpark.com\n281-362-6800\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/newpark-resources-reports-first-quarter-2018-results-300637553.html\nSOURCE Newpark Resources, Inc.",
