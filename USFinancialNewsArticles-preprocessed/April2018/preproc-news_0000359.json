Mr. Tallent will move into a new role as Executive Chairman of United’s Board of Directors. Lynn Harton, President and CEO of United’s banking subsidiary, will become CEO of United. As Executive Chairman, Mr. Tallent will continue to focus on board governance, strategic planning, and corporate development.\nMr. Tallent has been with United since 1984. Under his dedicated stewardship, it has expanded from a single location with $40 million in assets to a four-state regional community bank with $12.3 billion in assets. Mr. Tallent’s strategic vision and commitment to culture and corporate responsibility have been instrumental in United’s success.\n“I have been committed to seeing United become a market leading institution and regain the strength we have enjoyed for decades. Today, the Bank is thriving and it has one of the most capable management teams in the industry. Lynn has done an excellent job as Chief Executive Officer of the Bank, and the time is right for me to reduce my role,” said Mr. Tallent. “I am grateful to the shareholders, the management team, and the Board of Directors for their confidence in me and proud of what we have accomplished together. The future is bright for United, and I look forward to serving in my new role as Executive Chairman.”\n“I am honored to lead this organization into its next chapter,” said Harton. “We have a solid foundation, and are well-positioned for continued growth and success. It has been an honor to work alongside Jimmy for the past several years, and I look forward to continuing to serve United together in our new roles.”\nHarton was named CEO of United Community Bank in August 2017 and was elected to the Board of Directors in February 2015. Prior to joining United in 2012, Harton served in executive capacities with various financial institutions.
