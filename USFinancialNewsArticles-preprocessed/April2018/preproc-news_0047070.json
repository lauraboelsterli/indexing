    "text": "April 23, 2018 / 3:17 AM / Updated 2 hours ago China says 32 nationals killed when bus falls off bridge in North Korea Ben Blanchard 3 Min Read \nBEIJING (Reuters) - Thirty-two Chinese tourists and four North Koreans died when a bus crashed off a bridge in North Korea, China’s foreign ministry said on Monday, with two Chinese nationals in critical condition. \nChinese tourists make up about 80 percent of all foreign visitors to North Korea, says a South Korean think-tank, the Korea Maritime Institute, which estimates that tourism generates revenue of about $44 million each year for the isolated country. \nChinese diplomats visited the scene of Sunday’s crash in North Hwanghae province, the foreign ministry said. \nState television’s main Chinese-language news channel showed images of a crashed blue bus with its wheels in the air, in footage taken in pouring rain in the dark. \nIt also showed at least one person being treated in hospital. \nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters he could not give additional details of the accident as an investigation was under way. \nChinese President Xi Jinping had asked the Foreign Ministry and Chinese embassy to take “all necessary means” to handle the accident, the ministry said in a later statement. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang answers questions about a major bus accident in North Korea, during a news conference in Beijing, China April 23, 2018. REUTERS/Jason Lee \nIn a separate statement, China’s health ministry said it was sending a team of medical experts, along with equipment and drugs, to North Korea, to help treat survivors. \nThe North Hwanghae province that borders South Korea is home to Kaesong, an ancient Korean capital thronged by tourists. \nNorth Korea is a popular, if offbeat, tourist destination for Chinese, especially those from the country’s northeast. \nChina said more than 237,000 Chinese visited in 2012, but stopped publishing the figures in 2013. \nChina is North Korea’s most important economic and diplomatic backer, despite Beijing’s anger at Pyongyang’s repeated nuclear and missile tests and support for strong United Nations sanctions against North Korea.
