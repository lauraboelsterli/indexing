    "text": "EditorsNote: adds “Joe” in last graf\nA.J. Pollock and Ketel Marte hit bases-empty homers, and Arizona right-hander Zack Greinke extended his mastery of the San Francisco Giants in the Diamondbacks’ 3-1 victory on Thursday in Phoenix.\nPollock homered to break a 1-1 tie in sixth inning, and Marte went deep in the seventh in support of Greinke, who gave up a Brandon Belt homer among three hits while striking out two and walking one in seven innings. Greinke is 12-2 with a 2.31 ERA against the Giants in 18 career starts.\nJeff Mathis, Greinke’s personal catcher, had two hits and scored a run as the Diamondbacks (13-5) tied the record for the best start in franchise history. Arizona has won its first six series, also a franchise record.\nBelt homered in the second inning as the Giants took a 1-0 lead, but their only other hits were Andrew McCutchen’s double in the first inning and Gregor Blanco’s single in the third. San Francisco has lost five of six.\nGreinke (2-1) retired 13 of the final 14 after Blanco was thrown out attempting to steal second base to end the third inning, a play that was overturned on replay review.\nArchie Bradley struck out the side in the eighth inning and Brad Boxberger gave up two singles before getting Belt to foul out for his sixth save.\nSan Francisco starter Ty Blach (1-3) allowed six hits and two runs in six innings. He struck out four and walked three.\nBelt hit his second homer in as many plate appearances when he led off the second inning with his fourth of the year for a 1-0 lead. He hit a game-winning, two-run homer in the 10th inning of a 4-3 victory Wednesday.\nMathis doubled and scored on David Peralta’s single to tie it at 1 in the third inning.\nPollock led off the fourth inning with his fourth homer of the season for 2-1 lead. Marte’s homer was his first.\nArizona right fielder Chris Owings was removed from the game in the top of the third inning after colliding with center fielder Pollock while catching Joe Panik’s fly ball to deep right-center field. Owings left the field under his own power.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
