    "text": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., April 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Healthcare Trust of America, Inc. (NYSE: HTA) (\"HTA\") announced results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nOperating\nNet Income Attributable to Common Stockholders: Decreased (27.6)% to $9.8 million, compared to Q1 2017. Earnings per diluted share decreased (44.4)% to $0.05 per diluted share, compared to Q1 2017. This decrease is primarily related to the increase in depreciation and amortization of $23.3 million as a result of the increase in the size of our investment portfolio. Funds From Operations (\"FFO\"): As defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"), increased 40.5%, to $84.6 million, compared to Q1 2017. FFO per diluted share decreased (2.4)%, to $0.40 per diluted share, compared to Q1 2017. Normalized FFO: Increased 41.3%, to $85.0 million, compared to Q1 2017. Normalized FFO per diluted share remained stable at $0.41 per diluted share, compared to Q1 2017. Normalized Funds Available for Distribution (\"FAD\"): Increased 43.6%, to $75.9 million, compared to Q1 2017. Same-Property Cash Net Operating Income (\"NOI\"): Increased $1.8 million, or 2.3%, to $81.0 million, compared to Q1 2017. Excluding the MOBs located on its Forest Park campuses, Same-Property Cash NOI growth would have been 3.2%. This increase was driven by an increase of 1.5% in Same-Property rental revenue and an increase of 70 bps to 88.5% in Same-Property rental margins, measured as Same-Property Cash NOI divided by Same-Property rental revenue, compared to Q1 2017. From an occupancy perspective for the Same-Property pool, the leased rate increased 20 bps to 92.1% while the occupancy rate declined 10 bps to 91.0%, compared to Q1 2017.\nPortfolio\nLeasing: HTA entered into new and renewal leases on approximately 663,000 square feet of GLA, or 2.7% of its portfolio. Tenant retention for the Same-Property portfolio was 81% by GLA for the quarter, which included approximately 609,000 square feet of GLA of total expiring leases. Releasing spreads for renewal leases on a cash basis were 2.7%. Renewal leases included tenant improvements of $1.07 per square foot of GLA per year of the lease term and approximately seven days of free rent per year of the lease term. Leased Rate: As of March 31, 2018, HTA had a leased rate for its portfolio of 91.8% by GLA and an occupancy rate of 90.7% by GLA. Forest Park Update: During the three months ended March 31, 2018, HTA entered into approximately 41,000 square feet of GLA of new leases on the former Forest Park Dallas campus. This leasing included approximately 37,000 square feet of GLA that is directly leased to the hospital. Development: Subsequent to March 31, 2018, HTA entered into a development agreement for a new MOB in the key gateway market of Miami, Florida. The state-of-the-art MOB will total approximately 51,000 square feet of GLA and be located adjacent to the Jackson South Hospital. Total development costs are estimated to be $21.8 million and the building is expected to be 70% pre-leased to the hospital with construction expected to begin in 2019. Investments: During the quarter, HTA remained disciplined and strategically expanded within its key gateway markets. HTA invested $8.4 million to acquire an MOB of approximately 24,000 square feet of GLA in Raleigh, North Carolina, that was 100% leased as of the acquisition date to Duke Health System. In addition, HTA invested $3.9 million to consolidate its ownership interests in several MOBs. Dispositions: As of April 30, 2018, HTA has received letters of intent to sell multiple MOBs totaling an aggregate sales price of over $50 million. These properties are subject to customary closing conditions and no closings are assured.\n2017 Investment Performance\nCash NOI: During the three months ended March 31, 2018, HTA generated $34.5 million of Cash NOI on its 2017 investments, including its investment in its unconsolidated joint venture. This Cash NOI includes approximately $1.8 million of income from property management and building engineering services provided to its tenants. As of March 31, 2018, HTA's run rate yield on its 2017 investments was approximately 5.2%, which included the full year impact of new leases that were signed but not yet occupied. Development: During the three months ended March 31, 2018, five of the seven acquired development properties were completed. The remaining two development properties, which are 100% pre-leased, are on track to be completed by the middle of 2018. As of the end of the quarter, the five development properties were 84% leased and generated $1.1 million of Cash NOI. HTA believes it is currently in the late stages of lease negotiations for an additional 26,000 square feet of GLA that would bring the leased rate on these development properties to 89% if completed. In total, the seven development properties are projected to generate between approximately $2.5 million and $2.8 million in quarterly Cash NOI upon completion and stabilization.\nBalance Sheet\nBalance Sheet: As of March 31, 2018, HTA had total leverage of 33.0% measured as net debt (total debt less cash and cash equivalents) to total capitalization, and 5.9x measured as net debt to Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for real estate (\"Adjusted EBITDAre\"). Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $1.1 billion, including $994.5 million of availability under HTA's unsecured revolving credit facility, $56.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and a $75.0 million forward equity agreement, excluding anticipated costs to borrow.\nFinancial Results - First Quarter 2018\nRental Income\nRental income increased 41.6% to $175.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $124.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nNet Income\nNet income decreased (28.5)% to $10.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $14.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This decrease is primarily related to the increase in depreciation and amortization of $23.3 million as a result of the increase in the size of our investment portfolio.\nFFO\nFFO, as defined by NAREIT, was $0.40 per diluted share, or $84.6 million, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $0.41 per diluted share, or $60.2 million, for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nNormalized FFO\nNormalized FFO was $0.41 per diluted share, or $85.0 million, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, which remained stable compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nNormalized FAD\nNormalized FAD increased 43.6% to $75.9 million, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $52.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nNOI\nNOI increased 40.2% to $119.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $85.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nSame-Property Cash NOI\nSame-Property Cash NOI increased $1.8 million, or 2.3%, to $81.0 million, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $79.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.

In addition, HTA invested $3.9 million to consolidate its ownership interests in several MOBs.\nTenant Retention\nTenant retention for the Same-Property portfolio was 81% by GLA for the quarter, which included approximately 609,000 square feet of GLA of expiring leases.\nAbout Healthcare Trust of America, Inc.\nHealthcare Trust of America, Inc.

HTA believes that NOI provides an accurate measure of the operating performance of its operating assets because NOI excludes certain items that are not associated with the management of its properties. Additionally, HTA believes that NOI is a widely accepted measure of comparative operating performance of real estate investment trusts (\"REITs\"). However, HTA's use of the term NOI may not be comparable to that of other REITs as they may have different methodologies for computing this amount. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of its financial performance. NOI should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements.\nCash NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure which excludes from NOI: (i) straight-line rent adjustments; and (ii) amortization of below and above market leases/leasehold interests. Contractual base rent, contractual rent increases, contractual rent concessions and changes in occupancy or lease rates upon commencement and expiration of leases are a primary driver of HTA's revenue performance. HTA believes that Cash NOI, which removes the impact of straight-line rent adjustments, provides another measurement of the operating performance of its operating assets. Additionally, HTA believes that Cash NOI is a widely accepted measure of comparative operating performance of REITs. However, HTA's use of the term Cash NOI may not be comparable to that of other REITs as they may have different methodologies for computing this amount. Cash NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of its financial performance. Cash NOI should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements.\nTo facilitate the comparison of Cash NOI between periods, HTA calculates comparable amounts for a subset of its owned and operational properties referred to as \"Same-Property\". Same-Property Cash NOI excludes properties which have not been owned and operated by HTA during the entire span of all periods presented, excluding properties intended for disposition in the near term, development and land parcels, HTA's share of unconsolidated joint ventures, notes receivable interest income and certain non-routine items. Same-Property Cash NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of its financial performance. Same-Property Cash NOI should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements.\nHEALTHCARE TRUST OF AMERICA, INC.\nFFO, NORMALIZED FFO AND NORMALIZED FAD\n(In thousands, except per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet income attributable to common stockholders\n$\n9,802\n$\n13,545\nDepreciation and amortization expense related to investments in real estate\n69,856\n46,689\nGain on sale of real estate, net\n—\n(3)\nImpairment\n4,606\n—\nProportionate share of joint venture depreciation and amortization\n351\n—\nFFO attributable to common stockholders\n$\n84,615\n$\n60,231\nTransaction expenses\n191\n284\nGain on change in fair value of derivative financial instruments, net\n—\n(839)\nLoss on extinguishment of debt, net\n—\n32\nNoncontrolling income from partnership units included in diluted shares\n181\n425\nNormalized FFO attributable to common stockholders\n$\n84,987\n$\n60,133\nOther income\n(35)\n(8)\nNon-cash compensation expense\n3,479\n2,530\nStraight-line rent adjustments, net\n(3,166)\n(1,209)\nAmortization of (below) and above market leases/leasehold interests and corporate assets, net\n751\n273\nDeferred revenue - tenant improvement related\n(31)\n—\nAmortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount/premium, net\n1,289\n786\nRecurring capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing commissions\n(11,350)\n(9,640)\nNormalized FAD attributable to common stockholders\n$\n75,924\n$\n52,865\nNet income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share\n$\n0.05\n$\n0.09\nFFO adjustments per diluted share, net\n0.35\n0.32\nFFO attributable to common stockholders per diluted share\n$\n0.40\n$\n0.41\nNormalized FFO adjustments per diluted share, net\n0.01\n0.00\nNormalized FFO attributable to common stockholders per diluted share\n$\n0.41\n$\n0.41\nWeighted average diluted common shares outstanding\n209,177\n146,117\nHTA computes FFO in accordance with the current standards established by NAREIT. NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate property and impairment write-downs of depreciable assets, plus depreciation and amortization related to investments in real estate, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. HTA presents this non-GAAP financial measure because it considers it an important supplemental measure of its operating performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. Historical cost accounting assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen based on market conditions, many industry investors have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate, among other items, it provides a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or loss attributable to common stockholders.\nHTA computes Normalized FFO, which excludes from FFO: (i) transaction expenses; (ii) gain or loss on change in fair value of derivative financial instruments; (iii) gain or loss on extinguishment of debt; (iv) noncontrolling income or loss from partnership units included in diluted shares; and (v) other normalizing items, which include items that are unusual and infrequent in nature. HTA presents this non-GAAP financial measure because it allows for the comparison of its operating performance to other REITs and between periods on a consistent basis. HTA's methodology for calculating Normalized FFO may be different from the methods utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to other REITs. Normalized FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of its financial performance, nor is it indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. Normalized FFO should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements.\nHTA also computes Normalized FAD, which excludes from Normalized FFO: (i) other income or expense; (ii) non-cash compensation expense; (iii) straight-line rent adjustments; (iv) amortization of below and above market leases/leasehold interests and corporate assets; (v) amortization of deferred financing costs and debt premium/discount; and (vi) recurring capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing commissions. HTA believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides a meaningful supplemental measure of its operating performance. Normalized FAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of its financial performance, nor is it indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. Normalized FAD should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/healthcare-trust-of-america-inc-reports-first-quarter-2018-earnings-300638596.html\nSOURCE Healthcare Trust of America, Inc.",
