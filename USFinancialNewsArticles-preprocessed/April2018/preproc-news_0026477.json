(OTCQX:QNTO) (the \"Company\"), the holding company for Quaint Oak Bank, announced today that its Board of Directors at their meeting on April 11, 2018, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share on the common stock of the Company payable on May 7, 2018, to the shareholders of record at the close of business on April 23, 2018.\nRobert T. Strong, President and Chief Executive Officer stated, “I am pleased to announce our ninth consecutive increase in our quarterly cash dividend moving from the current $0.05 per share to $0.07 per share. This represents a 40% increase in the dividend rate. The increased dividend is a reflection of our strong financial performance for fiscal 2017; and we look forward to the reduction in our marginal tax rate to 21% for 2018. As of April 11, 2018, our closing market stock price was $13.20 per share. This new dividend amount of $0.07 annualized represents a dividend rate of over 2%. As always, our current and continued business strategy includes long term profitability and the payment of dividends. This focus reflects the Company’s strong commitment to shareholder value.”\nQuaint Oak Bancorp, Inc. is the parent company for the Quaint Oak Family of Companies.
