    "text": "CHICAGO, April 2, 2018 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- As part of National Equity Fund, Inc.'s commitment of creating a path to leadership for its employees, it announced the promotion of Reena Bramblett to senior vice president of proprietary equity placement and the creation of a new department â€“ special initiatives - and appointed Karen Przypyszny as managing director of the group.\nBramblett has been with NEF for seven years and played an instrumental role in the growth of proprietary equity placements as she managed key relations with several investors. She previously worked at Homestead Equity Fund and has an extensive background in originations, accounting and fund management.\nDuring Przypyszny's 17 years at NEF, she served as senior vice president in acquisitions and most recently in investor relations. As managing director of special initiatives, she will initially focus on the new Opportunity Zones program, a national community investment plan part of the tax reform signed late last year, intended to use tax incentives to draw long-term investments in areas of the country that struggle with high poverty and slow job growth.\n\"It's always gratifying to promote from within when we look to fill key management roles,\" said Joe Hagan, president and CEO of National Equity Fund. \"Both Reena and Karen are exceptional professionals and I look forward to working with each of them in their new positions.\"\nAbout National Equity Fund, Inc.\nChicago-based nonprofit, National Equity Fund, Inc., is a leading syndicator of low-income housing tax credits (LIHTC) and an affiliate of the Local Initiatives Corporation.
