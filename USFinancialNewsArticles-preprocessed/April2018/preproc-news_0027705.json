    "text": "NORTH TONAWANDA, N.Y., April 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Taylor Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ SmallCap: \"TAYD\") announced today that it had third quarter sales of $6,573,658, up from last year's third quarter sales of $5,672,720. Sales for the first nine months were $17,953,152, down from last year's first nine months' sales of $19,235,898.\nNet earnings for the third quarter were ($23,417), down from last year's third quarter earnings of $338,203. Net earnings for the first nine months were $330,477, also down from last year's earnings of $1,486,317.\n\"The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Act) became law in December of 2017. Due to changes in the corporate tax rates, the Company was required to record a non-cash write down of deferred tax assets and recognized incremental deferred tax expense of $164,000 during the quarter ending February 28, 2018\" stated Douglas P. Taylor, President. He continued, \"This eliminated our entire third quarter pre-tax income of $145,583 and resulted in the net loss reported for the quarter. While this one-time adjustment required by the new tax law hurt this quarter's earnings, the reduction in corporate tax rates should be a benefit to the Company in the future.\" He continued, \"Our firm order backlog at the end of the third quarter was $18.8 million, down a bit from $19.5 million exactly one year ago.\"\nHe continued, \"Sales to industrial customers were up by 31% and aerospace sales were up by 8% from the levels recorded in our previous year. Construction product sales to Asian customers have increased 40% for the year to date and proposal activity to U.S. seismic customers has increased as well.\" He concluded, \"Our sales and profitability have been impacted by a slowdown in the U.S. construction business and we expect seismic and wind damper sales to improve when that sector does.\"\nTaylor Devices, Inc. is a 63 year-old company engaged in the design, development, manufacture & marketing of shock absorption, rate control and energy storage devices for use in various types of vehicles, machinery, equipment & structures. The company continues to achieve growth in the developing seismic protection field and in the isolation of wind-induced vibrations.\nTAYD:04/13/18\nThird Quarter (3 months ended 02/28/18 & 02/28/17)\nF/Y 18\nF/Y 17\nSales\n$6,573,658\n$5,672,720\nNet Earnings\n($23,417)\n$ 338,203\nEarnings per Share\n($.01)\n$ .10\nNine Months (9 months ended 02/28/18 & 02/28/17)\nF/Y 18\nF/Y 17\nSales\n$17,953,152\n$19,235,898\nNet Earnings\n$ 330,477\n$1,486,317\nEarnings per Share\n$ .09\n$ .43\nShares Outstanding\n3,451,348\n3,424,192\nTaylor's website can be visited at: www.taylordevices.com ; with company newsletters at www.taylordevices.com/press-releases.html .
