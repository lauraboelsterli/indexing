    "text": " 53 a.m. ET Share \nTeachers threaten similar walkouts in Kentucky, Arizona Reuters Protesting teachers pack the state Capitol rotunda to capacity on April 3 in Oklahoma City, Okla. \nBy Michelle Hackman \nMost Oklahoma teachers will return to school on Friday, putting an end to a nine-day strike that resulted in pay raises and boosted state funding for education. \nThe demonstrations, which sent teachers by the tens of thousands to the state Capitol each day schools were closed, represented the strongest labor action the conservative state has seen in several decades. \nThe threat of a strike initially prompted legislators to give the teachers a $6,000 average raise this year and add nearly $500 million in education funding. During the subsequent walkout, the legislature passed several other revenue increases to benefit education, including a new tax on online sales and an expansion of the types of games permitted at casinos. \nOklahoma was the second state to hold a prolonged, statewide teachers strike just this year, after West Virginia, and with educators threatening imminent work stoppages in Kentucky and Arizona, it will likely not be the last.",
