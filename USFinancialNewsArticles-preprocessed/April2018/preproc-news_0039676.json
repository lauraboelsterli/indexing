    "text": "ROCKAWAY, N.J., April 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sussex Bank, a full-service, regional bank with 14 branch locations in New Jersey and New York, announced today a new name and brand identity following its recent partnership with Community Bank of Bergen County, NJ. Effective April 25, Sussex Bank will be SB One Bank, and as part of its rebrand is introducing a new logo and color palette.\n“Our merger was built upon a shared vision, and in coming together we made a choice to do so under one name,” said Anthony Labozzetta, president and CEO of SB One Bank. “This merger created opportunities for us to refresh and elevate our brand, and we wholeheartedly embraced the process. We are excited to share these details with our customers; however, we want to reinforce that despite our new name and shiny new exterior, we are the same bank that our customers have come to trust.”\nThe updated signs recently began to appear in the Bank’s 14 locations, and details will continue to be revealed over the next few months in branch, through direct mail, via print and digital advertising and on the Bank’s website and social media channels. Ribbon-cutting ceremonies commemorating the launch of the new name and brand will take place on April 26, in the Sparta and Maywood branches, and celebratory launch events for staff and customers are scheduled throughout the next few weeks at all other bank locations. More details surrounding these in-branch events will be communicated via social media.\n“Finding the right name, the right brand perception for our newly joined bank has been a priority for our leadership team, and we are confident that we have hit upon a look and feel that both speaks to our heritage and paves the way for a successful future,” said Rich Glicini, senior vice president and chief administrative officer, SB One Bank.\nSB One Bank’s success hinges on its ability to create deep personal connections with its customers and to serve the communities in which it operates. The Bank’s mission has not changed, but its name, logo and color scheme has experienced a refresh. SB One Bank has been teasing its new brand with customers since earlier this year, when it merged with Community Bank of Bergen County, NJ.\nAbout Sussex Bancorp\nSussex Bancorp (Nasdaq:SBBX) is the holding company for Sussex Bank which is headquartered in Morris County, New Jersey and operates regionally with fourteen branch locations throughout Bergen, Morris and Sussex counties in New Jersey and in Astoria, New York.
