Trees sway during a heavy storm and strong winds, as Cyclone Keni approaches Ba, in Fiji, in this still image taken from social media video April 10, 2018. MANDATORY CREDIT. Naziah Ali/via REUTERS \nCyclone Keni was upgraded earlier on Tuesday to a Category 3 storm and is expected to bring winds of up to 170 km (105 miles) an hour when it makes landfall later in the day. \nParts of Fiji are still cleaning up after Cyclone Josie hit over the Easter weekend, leading to major flooding that killed six people. Many people who were evacuated to shelters have only just returned to their homes and some roads remain closed. \nTropical storms are graded from the lowest Category One to the highest Category Five. In February, Fiji escaped without deaths or widespread damage when Gita, a Category Four storm, lashed the region, causing widespread destruction in Tonga and Samoa.
