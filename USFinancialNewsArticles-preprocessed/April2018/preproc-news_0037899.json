    "text": "4 Hours Ago | 01:32 \nRenaissance man Jamie Foxx pays auto aficionado Jay Leno a visit on Thursday's episode of CNBC's \" Jay Leno's Garage \" and gets a high-speed driving lesson from his own stunt-double, Jay Lynch. \nLynch, whose stuntman career spans almost 30 years and over 200 movies, has collaborated with Foxx 10 times. Their relationship goes as far back as the 1997 comedy \" Booty Call .\" \"Not sure what the stunts were in that,\" Leno notes. \nBut on occasion Foxx does his own stunts. CNBC | Jay Leno's Garage Jamie Foxx \nHe recounts to Leno shooting a scene for the 2017 action thriller \" Baby Driver \" during which the windshield of his car broke and he had to have glass removed from his eye before returning from the doctor to shoot the scene again. \n\"I was trying to act brave, Jay,\" he says, adding that ideally you want to do your own stunts as much as possible. \nSo, in this episode of \" Jay Leno's Garage ,\" Lynch demonstrates how to do three stunts while driving a 2018 Dodge Hellcat, a Challenger with 707 horsepower and a top speed of 199 mph. He performs a power slide, a few donuts and a reverse-180, otherwise known as a J-turn, \"named after a handsome ex-talk show host,\" jokes Leno. \nDuring the initial demonstration, Foxx can't keep it together. As long as the car is in motion, he shrieks, and whenever the car stops he has to collect himself. CNBC | Jay Leno's Garage Entertainers Jamie Foxx and Jay Leno with stuntman Jay Lynch behind the wheel \n\"I wasn't scared at all,\" he assures the camera after he gets out. \"Jay was in there screaming like a little b----.\" \nBut when it's Foxx's turn to behind the wheel, he proves to be a natural. He weaves through orange cones, completes a reverse-180 on his first try and does donuts until the car is engulfed in a cloud of burnt rubber. \"I know you won a Grammy and an Oscar,\" Leno tells him from the backseat. \"If you win the Indianapolis 500, I'm going to be pissed.\" \nFoxx then jumps out of the driver seat and is met with cheers and applause from the film crew. He rips off his shirt, runs off and does a set of push ups. CNBC | Jay Leno's Garage \nThat's when Lynch tells Foxx he thinks he is ready to do it alone. Foxx responds with a dab. Leno seems concerned. \"You're not abandoning ship, are you?\" he asks. \"You're leaving me in here with the crazy man.\" \nBut even without Lynch by his side, Foxx completes each trick with ease and then, of course, drives through a bunch of stacked-up empty boxes. \"No car stunt drive is complete without [that],\" says Leno. \n\"Looks like I'm going to be on the unemployment line,\" Lynch jokes. \"Foxx, you knocked it out, baby.\" \nCNBC's \" Jay Leno's Garage \" airs Thursdays at 10 pm ET.
