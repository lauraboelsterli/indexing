    "text": "ITHACA, Mich., April 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Commercial National Financial Corporation (Pink Sheets:CEFC) today announced first quarter 2018 net income of $1,064,000, or $.27 per share compared to a first quarter 2017 net loss of $206,000, or $.05 per share. Excluding merger-related expenses for the merger with Capital Directions, Inc., the holding company for Mason State Bank, 2017 first quarter net income was $803,000, or $.21 per share.\nTotal assets were $530 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $535.9 million at March 31, 2017. Total loans were approximately flat year over year. The lending environment remains very competitive in our markets. We are continuing our efforts to increase loan volume while maintaining our credit quality standards.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, net interest income increased $16,000, or .4%. Increases in interest income from the higher interest rate environment were mostly offset by a higher cost of funds. The provision for loan losses decreased $16,000 due to a lower trend in historical losses. Non-interest income decreased $12,000, or 3% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to March 31, 2017 quarter primarily due to lower service charges. Operating expenses decreased by $1,665,000, or 37.9% mostly due to the absence of one-time merger-related expenses in the current quarter as well as from the realization of other cost saving opportunities.\nCommercial National Financial Corporation operates through a single subsidiary bank, Commercial Bank.
