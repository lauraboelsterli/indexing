    "text": "NEW YORK, April 19 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs analysts said on Thursday current concerns about a U.S. yield curve inversion among traders as an omen of a looming recession are “overblown,” though an inversion is often followed by a 3-5 percent drop in the S&P 500.\n“While we would consider a significant inversion of the Treasury curve a bearish signal, we think such concerns are currently misplaced,” Goldman analysts Charles Himmelberg and Matthieu Droumaguet wrote in a research note.
