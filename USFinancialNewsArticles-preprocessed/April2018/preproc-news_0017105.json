    "text": "EditorsNote: rewords fifth, sixth and 10th grafs\nRussell Westbrook recorded his NBA-leading 25th triple-double to lead the Oklahoma City Thunder into the playoffs with a 115-93 win over the host Miami Heat on Monday night.\nWestbrook scored 23 points, grabbed a season-high 18 rebounds and dished off 13 assists. Paul George had a game-high 27 points, and Jerami Grant added 17.\nJosh Richardson led Miami with 18 points, and Hassan Whiteside added 16 with eight rebounds. Tyler Johnson and Justise Winslow scored 12 apiece.\nOklahoma City took its first lead at 85-84 with 10:28 left in the fourth quarter after trailing by as many as 18 in the contest.\nThe Thunder outscored the Heat 39-12 in the final period.\nThe Thunder, who entered the game in seventh place in the Western Conference standings, qualified for the postseason for the eighth time in 10 seasons since relocating to Oklahoma City from Seattle.\nThe Thunder have won seven of their last eight games against the Heat, including four of the last five at South Beach.\nOklahoma City won both games in the season series, beating Miami 105-99 on March 23 at home.\nMiami dropped its second straight game after losing 122-98 to the Knicks in New York last Friday.\nThe Heat clinched a spot in the playoffs last week, but they slipped from the sixth spot in the Eastern Conference to seventh on Monday. Miami trails the Milwaukee Bucks by one game with one game to play, but the Heat hold the tiebreaker.\nMiami opened the game on a 12-0 run — its best start to a game this season — and went up 23-5 as Oklahoma City missed its first 10 shots from the floor in a span of 7:13.\nHowever, Oklahoma City used a good run of its own — 16-3 — to battle back and pull within 27-21 after one quarter.\nWestbrook scored all of his 10 first-half points in the second quarter. The Thunder trailed 52-49 at halftime despite shooting just 34 percent and being outscored by 30 points in the paint.\nThe Thunder tied it at 76 with two minutes remaining in the third, but Miami scored the last five to take an 81-76 lead.\nOklahoma City concludes the regular season back home against Memphis on Wednesday. Miami closes at home against Toronto on Wednesday.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
