    "text": "April 25 (Reuters) - U.S. tiremaker Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co’s quarterly profit more than halved on Wednesday, hit by higher raw materials-related costs and weaker demand.\nThe company’s net income fell to $75 million, or 31 cents per share in the first quarter ended March 31, from $166 million, or 65 cents per share, a year earlier.\nOn an adjusted basis, it earned 50 cents a share.\nRevenue rose 3.5 percent to $3.83 billion.
