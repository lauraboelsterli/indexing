GE also reduced its revenue by $220 million for 2016 and $2.2 billion for 2017.\nFor all earnings prior to 2016, GE is reporting a $4.2 billion decrease for its earnings. The restatement was largely in line with what GE announced during the company's fourth-quarter call with investors , with no repercussions for the company's expected 2018 earnings.\nshow chapters Don't think there's any more negative news on GE, says expert 8:45 AM ET Fri, 13 April 2018 | 03:55 The restatement stems from a need to adjust for new revenue recognition rules issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, announced in 2014. For GE, this especially applies to its long-term service contracts. GE is expected to report first quarter earnings on April 20 using the new accounting principle.\nShares of GE declined 2 percent in after hours trading Friday.\nRead the full restatement filing here.\nWATCH: GE positive for month show chapters Trading Nation: GE positive for month 19 Hours Ago | 02:16",
