    "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - After a decade of ultra loose policy, the Federal Reserve will likely raise interest rates to a “slightly restrictive” setting in the years ahead as unemployment falls and inflation ticks higher, an influential outgoing Fed official said on Wednesday.\nFILE PHOTO: William C. Dudley, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York answers questions delivered by moderator Rob Cox during a Reuters Newsmakers panel titled \"Banking Culture: Still Room for Improvement?\" in the borough of Manhattan, New York City, U.S., February 7, 2018. REUTERS/Ashlee Espinal/File Photo New York Fed President William Dudley said he was among the U.S. central bankers last month to mark up forecasts that show the policy rate rising to about 3.4 percent by 2020, a full half a percentage point above the current estimate of “neutral.” Dudley himself said he marked up his estimate of neutral to around 3 percent.\nIt implies that policy “will need to become slightly restrictive in the years ahead,” said Dudley, a long-time permanent voter on monetary policy who will leave the Fed in two months.\nHe repeated his support for gradual rate hikes given inflation remains below a 2-percent target, and predicted prices will edge higher. The Fed hiked rates last month and predicted two or three more rises before year end.\nRelated Coverage Possible trade war 'not winnable' for U.S.: Fed's Dudley Published forecasts last month suggested the Fed expects recent fiscal stimulus to boost economic growth for two years, but give no apparent permanent help to the economy. Unemployment dives, inflation rises just above the Fed’s target, and the central bank responds with interest rates rising to 3.4 percent, according to the forecasts.\n“A gradual path of interest rate increases remains appropriate,” Dudley said at Lehman College in the Bronx. “Even though the unemployment rate is low, inflation remains below our 2 percent objective. As long as that is true, the case for tightening policy more aggressively does not seem compelling.\nStill he added that the Fed “should not overstay its welcome” and keep pushing rates toward neutral.\nReporting by Jonathan Spicer; editing by Diane Craft\n ",
