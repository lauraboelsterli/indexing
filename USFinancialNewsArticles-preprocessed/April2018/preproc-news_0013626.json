    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Arizona Silver Exploration Inc. (the \" Company \") (TSX-V:AZS) announces results of the first quarter drilling program at its 100% owned Ramsey Silver Project located in La Paz County, Arizona.\nQ1 2018 Drilling Results\nArizona Silver Exploration Inc. completed seven reverse circulation (RC) exploration drill holes at its Ramsey Silver Project in February and March, 2018. All holes intersected intervals of mineralization within a package of altered rhyolite and quartz latite peripheral to higher grade mineralized intervals reported previously. Assay results are summarized in the table below. \"The seventh hole was drilled at an angle to the northwest to test the potential northward strike extension to the Ramsey Mine silver system, and also appears to have intersected the low-grade margin of the higher-grade silver system,\" stated Greg Hahn, President and CEO. These holes all appear to represent the true thickness of the mineral system at these locations.\nRamsey Silver Project Summary Drill Results 2018 Phase 1 Program Hole From (ft) To (ft) Thick (ft) Thick (m) Ag gpt Ag opt R1801 570 585 15 4.57 18.6 0.54 R1802 440 500 60 18.29 15.5 0.45 R1803 370 485 115 35.06 16.3 0.48 R1804 335 505 170 51.83 19.4 0.57 R1805 385 435 50 15.24 15.3 0.45 R1806 445 470 25 7.62 25.7 0.75 R1807 510 590 80 24.39 18.6 0.54 AVERAGE 73.6 22.43 18.0 0.53 Subsequent targets\nA zone southeast of the Ramsey Mine is characterized by surface samples with elevated Ag-Pb-Zn-Ba geochemistry within which the Creosote Vein is located. This zone remains to be tested with drilling. The Creosote Vein had limited historic production of ~10 opt Ag. Sampling by Arizona Silver returned values of up to 877 gpt Ag in outcrops of what might be the extension to the Creosote Vein. A similar-sized area north of the Creosote Vein contains a strong Ag-Pb-Zn-Ba surface geochemical anomaly associated with strong argillic and silicic alteration and brecciated rhyolite (see April 18, 2017 news release http://arizonasilverexploration.com/home-page/arizona-silver-exploration-inc-assays-up-to-877-grams-per-tonne-silver-at-ramsey-silver-project-la-paz-county-arizona/ ). Drilling beyond the geochemical anomaly locations will penetrate alluvial cover, which is prominent to the east and north of the areas around the Creosote Vein.\nTen additional holes have been permitted and are tentatively planned for Q2 2018 to test the areas featuring the surface geochemical anomalies. Please visit the Company’s website for drill hole locations and drilling program updates: www.arizonasilverexploration.com .\nQA/QC and Analytical Procedures\nAll drill cuttings were transported under strict chain of custody by ALS Minerals personnel to the ALS Minerals laboratory in Tucson, Arizona, where samples were dried and crushed to 70% passing 2 mm, a 250 gram split is taken and pulverized to 85% passing 75 microns, subject to a four-acid digestion, and then analyzed by ICP/MS for a 48-element package including silver, lead, and zinc. Samples over 100 ppm silver and over 10,000 ppm lead or zinc are re-analyzed using ICP for higher concentration levels. Selected intervals with high silver values will be re-submitted for 1-assay ton fire assays for gold.\nGreg Hahn, President and CEO and a Certified Professional Geologist (#7122) is the Qualified Person under NI43-101 responsible for preparing and reviewing the data contained in this press release.\nON BEHALF OF THE BOARD\nARIZONA SILVER EXPLORATION INC.\nGreg Hahn, President and Chief Executive Officer\nContact: Mike Stark, Chairman and Director\nPhone: 604-833-4278\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release, and the TSX Venture Exchange has in no way passed upon the merits of the transactions herein.\nCAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis news release contains certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the United States Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
