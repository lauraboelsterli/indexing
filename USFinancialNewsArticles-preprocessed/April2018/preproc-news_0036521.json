    "text": "PARIS, April 15 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday said the French state would start taking over rail operator SNCF’s debt from Jan 1, 2020.\nPlans to reform the state-owned company are a sensitive issue and railway staff have started rolling strikes in protest.\nMacron had already said that France would gradually take over part of rail operator SNCF’s 46 billion euros as and when reforms to make it profitable were implemented, but had so far not said when that could happen.
