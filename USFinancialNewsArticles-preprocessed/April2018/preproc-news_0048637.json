    "text": "OTTAWA, April 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ackroo Inc. (TSX-V:AKR) (OTC:AKRFF) (“Ackroo” or the “Company”), a gift card, loyalty and rewards technology and services provider, has filed its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe results for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflect year over year revenue growth of 23% and a 5 year cumulative average growth rate of 35% per year. The results also include a 7% increase in gross profit from 66% in 2016 to 73% in 2017.\n“We are very pleased with what we accomplished in 2017 as we continued to build a strong foundation for growth,” said Steve Levely, chief executive officer at Ackroo. “We focused on key product enhancements to support migrations of acquired merchants while also supporting our organic growth plans both instore and online. We made operational and product changes to better support our goal to specialize by segment while also support small, medium and enterprise merchants. We then finished the year with our largest revenue and location based acquisition to date with our acquisition of KESM/LoyalMark. As we enter 2018 we now support over 1,000 customers and 4,000 locations and have a business that has more than 65% of our revenues in recurring revenue and greater than 75% gross margins. We continue to maintain a customer retention rate in excess of 95% and will generate over $3 million of annual recurring revenue in 2018 alone. We have a product and operational model that is built for scale and is ready to continue to simplify, consolidate and improve the very fragmented gift card, loyalty and marketing landscape. All of these things have played a key role in our great start to 2018 so we are very excited for what lies ahead for Ackroo and for our shareholders.”\nThe complete financial results for Ackroo are available at www.sedar.com . Highlights include:\nRevenue of $2,737,830 for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $2,224,165 for the year ended December 31, 2016 (23% growth); Subscription and Service revenue was $1,708,015 for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $1,470,039 for the year ended December 31, 2016 (16% growth) Gross profit of $1,995,742 (73%) for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $1,463,488 (66%) for the year ended December 31, 2016 (7% increase)\nAbout Ackroo\nAckroo provides gift card and loyalty processing solutions to help retail and hospitality merchants of all sizes attract, retain and grow their customers and their revenues.
