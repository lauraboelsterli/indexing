    "text": "U.S. government debt prices fell on Wednesday.\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was higher at around 3.020 percent at 5:35 a.m. ET, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was higher at 3.195 percent. Bond yields move inversely to prices.\nSymbol Yield Change %Change US 3-MO --- US 1-YR --- US 2-YR --- US 5-YR --- US 10-YR --- US 30-YR --- Markets around the globe are keeping a close eye on the U.S. bond market after the yield on the 10-year Treasury note topped 3 percent on Tuesday for the first time in more than four years .\nThe yield had been flirting with the all-important psychological 3 percent level for days but, once hit, financial markets around the world reacted. On Tuesday, U.S. markets finished in the red, with the Dow closing down more than 400 points , while on Wednesday, markets in Europe and Asia were both trading deep in the red.\nInvestors have been selling Treasurys — leading to rising yields— amid expectations of rising inflation ; this may encourage the Fed to tighten monetary policy more rapidly.\nWith little economic data due Wednesday — aside from mortgage applications at 7 a.m. ET — investors are likely to keep an eye on moves in the bond market.\nAside from this, the U.S. Treasury is set to auction $35 billion in five-year notes and $17 billion in two-year floating rate notes (FRNs).\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding.\nOn Tuesday, President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to strive for stronger measures on Iran, in regards to the 2015 nuclear deal . The U.S. incumbent also delivered a positive note on NAFTA negotiations and the country's relationship with North Korea.\nNo speeches by members of the U.S. Federal Reserve are slated to take place today.",
