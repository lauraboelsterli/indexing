    "text": "HOUSTON (Reuters) - The overhaul of the Flexicoker at Exxon Mobil Corpâ€™s 560,500 barrel-per-day (bpd) Baytown, Texas, refinery may extend to early June, said sources familiar with plant operations.\nAn Exxon spokeswoman was not immediately available to discuss refinery operations.\nThe 42,000-bpd Flexicoker was shut on April 2 for the planned overhaul initially expected to take up to six weeks to complete, the sources said.\nA Flexicoker is a unit designed by Exxon to convert residual crude oil to motor fuels and produce industrial fuel gas instead of petroleum coke, a coal substitute.\nReporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by James Dalgleish\n ",
