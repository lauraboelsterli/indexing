    "text": "Quarterly Highlights\nNet loss of $450,000 for Q1 which includes $5.0 million of non-operating charges Bank level classified assets to capital ratio declined to 54%, down from 56% ALLL to total loans is 2.23%, down 4 bps sequentially with no loan loss provision in the quarter due to a reduction in specific reserve allocations on impaired loans and a decrease in the overall loan portfolio FTE net interest margin decreased 28 bps sequentially to 4.17% on lower loan yields due to paydowns on higher risk loans and lower yields on FTE municipal investments Core deposits remain at 88.3% of $1.5 billion total deposits and funding costs are low at 41 bps. Cost of deposits increased 5 bps sequentially due to increased pricing competition for deposits Tangible common equity to tangible assets declined 5 bps to 9.07% sequentially Reduced branch count to 42 with closure of 6 branches to improve efficiencies, bringing total closures to 15, or 25% of branch network\nLAFAYETTE, La.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- MidSouth Bancorp, Inc. (“MidSouth”) (NYSE:MSL) today reported a quarterly net loss available to common shareholders of $450,000 for the first quarter of 2018, compared to net earnings available to common shareholders of $1.7 million reported for the first quarter of 2017 and an $11.3 million net loss available to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2017. The first quarter of 2018 included an after tax charge of $691,000 resulting from the transfer of loans to held for sale, an after-tax charge of $3.1 million for regulatory remediation costs, an after-tax charge of $115,000 related to the branch closures during the quarter and an after-tax charge of $70,000 for legal fees related to the bulk loan sale. For comparison purposes, the fourth quarter of 2017 included an after tax charge of $3.9 million resulting from the transfer of loans to held for sale, a $3.6 million charge for the write-down of net deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, an after-tax charge of $1.2 million for regulatory remediation costs, an after-tax charge of $512,000 resulting from the write-down of assets held for sale, an after-tax gain on sale of branches of $484,000 and an after-tax charge of $111,000 for severance and retention accruals. Excluding these non-operating income items and expenses, diluted earnings for the first quarter of 2018 were $0.21 per common share, compared to a loss of $0.15 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017 and diluted earnings per common share of $0.15 for the first quarter of 2017.\nJim McLemore, President and CEO, remarked, \"The first quarter of 2018 represents the first quarter of our three-year strategic plan submitted to the regulators in November 2017. Although we are making progress on our strategic plan, progress is not yet measurable in terms of positive financial results. Our execution focus in 2018 is to reduce risk and build a solid foundation for future growth. In those terms, we are making good progress. Our focus has expanded to include addressing operational and compliance issues in addition to reducing our criticized asset levels. We are committing significant resources and expertise to accomplish this in a timely and efficient manner. In this regard, we invested approximately $3.9 million during the first quarter in remediation efforts related to our written agreement and strategic plan. These costs are consistent with our communication in January regarding the investment of approximately $10-$12 million in 2018 related to remediation efforts with costs concentrated in the first half of the year.\"\nBalance Sheet\nConsolidated assets remained constant at $1.9 billion for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 and December 31, 2017. Our stable core deposit base, which excludes time deposits, totaled $1.3 billion at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 and accounted for 88.3% and 87.7% of deposits at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Net loans totaled $1.1 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017.\nMidSouth’s Tier 1 leverage capital ratio was 12.80% at March 31, 2018, compared to 12.53% at December 31, 2017. Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratios were 17.08% and 18.34% at March 31, 2018, compared to 16.51% and 17.77% at December 31, 2017, respectively. Tier 1 common equity to total risk-weighted assets at March 31, 2018 was 12.50%, compared to 12.10% at December 31, 2017. Tangible common equity totaled $164.4 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $167.3 million at December 31, 2017. Tangible book value per share at March 31, 2018 was $9.89 versus $10.11 at December 31, 2017.\nAsset Quality\nNonperforming assets totaled $85.1 million at March 31, 2018, an increase of $27.8 million compared to $57.3 million reported at December 31, 2017. The increase in non-performing assets was primarily due to four credits moved to non-accrual, $22.5 million of which were previously classified and do not represent new problem credits. The increase is primarily attributable to $37.5 million of loans placed on non-accrual during the quarter. This increase was partially offset by the payoffs/paydowns of $3.7 million of non-accrual loans and the decrease of $4.3 million in nonperforming loans held for sale. Allowance coverage for nonperforming loans decreased to 30.84% at March 31, 2018, compared to 53.77% at December 31, 2017. The ALLL/total loans ratio was 2.23% at March 31, 2018 and 2.27% at December 31, 2017. Including valuation accounting adjustments on acquired loans, the total valuation accounting adjustment plus ALLL was 2.31% of loans at March 31, 2018. The ratio of annualized net charge-offs to total loans decreased to 0.54% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to 2.94% for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nTotal nonperforming assets to total loans plus ORE and other assets repossessed was 7.47% at March 31, 2018 compared to 4.83% at December 31, 2017. Loans classified as troubled debt restructurings, accruing (“TDRs, accruing”) totaled $1.2 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $1.4 million at December 31, 2017. Also included in nonperforming assets was nonperforming loans transferred to held for sale that totaled $808,000 and $5.1 million at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Total classified assets, including ORE, were $113.7 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $118.2 million at December 31, 2017. The classified to capital ratio at MidSouth Bank was 54.3% at March 31, 2018 versus 56.1% at December 31, 2017.\nOur provision for loan losses is intended to create an adequate allowance for loan losses in the loan portfolio at the end of each reporting period. Provisions for loan losses totaling $10.6 million and $2.8 million were appropriate for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively, based on our allowance for loan losses methodology that considers a number of quantitative and qualitative factors. Management determined the allowance for loan losses to be adequate at March 31, 2018, and, as a result, no provision for loan losses was expensed during the quarter ended March 31, 2018. This was primarily due to a reduction in specific reserve allocations on impaired loans as well as a decrease in our overall loan portfolio.\nMore information on our energy loan portfolio and other information on quarterly results can be found on our website at MidSouthBank.com under Investor Relations/Presentations.\nMr. McLemore noted “We were pleased to see our level of classified assets and net charge-offs decline this quarter. While we were not pleased with the increase in NPAs during the quarter, the majority of the increase represented continued migration of previously classified credits. There are no recorded impairments on the four credits accounting for the increase. We continue to aggressively identify problem credits as circumstances dictate. Our capital strength with a Tangible Common Equity ratio of 9% continues to allow greater flexibility to invest in operational and compliance enhancements and manage problem assets from a position of strength, but we also remain committed to being as judicious as possible from a capital preservation standpoint.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 vs. Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Comparison\nMidSouth reported a net loss available to common shareholders of $450,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to a net loss available to common shareholders of $11.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017. The fourth quarter of 2017 included a $744,000 gain on the sale of branches. Excluding this non-operating revenue, revenues from consolidated operations decreased $2.6 million in sequential-quarter comparison. Net interest income decreased $2.1 million in sequential-quarter comparison, resulting from a $2.0 million decrease in interest income and a $144,000 increase in interest expense. Operating noninterest income decreased $455,000 in sequential-quarter comparison.\nThe first quarter of 2018 included non-operating expenses totaling $5.0 million which consisted of $145,000 of costs related to branch closures, $3.9 million of regulatory remediation costs, an $875,000 loss on the transfer of loans to held for sale and $88,000 of legal fees related to the bulk loan sale. The fourth quarter of 2017 included non-operating expenses totaling $8.8 million which consisted of $171,000 of severance and retention accruals, a $789,000 write-down on assets held for sale, $1.8 million of regulatory remediation costs and a $6.0 million loss on the transfer of loans to held for sale. Excluding these non-operating expenses, noninterest expense decreased $343,000 in sequential-quarter comparison and consisted primarily of a $312,000 decrease in occupancy expense and a $255,000 decrease in expenses on ORE, which were partially offset by a $240,000 increase in legal and professional fees. The provision for loan losses decreased $10.6 million in sequential-quarter comparison. We recorded an income tax benefit of $34,000 for the first quarter of 2018. In connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a $3.6 million tax-related charge was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets. Excluding this adjustment, we recorded an income tax benefit of $4.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nDividends on the Series B Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury as a result of our participation in the Small Business Lending Fund totaled $720,000 for the first quarter of 2018 based on a dividend rate of 9%, unchanged from $720,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017. Dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock issued with the December 28, 2012 acquisition of PSB Financial Corporation totaled $90,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.\nFully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) net interest income decreased $2.2 million in sequential-quarter comparison, primarily due to a $2.0 million decrease in interest income on loans, a $257,000 decrease in FTE interest income on investment securities and a $141,000 increase in interest expense on deposits, which were partially offset by a $200,000 increase in interest income on time and interest bearing deposits in other banks. Interest income on loans decreased in sequential-quarter comparison due to a decrease in the average yield on loans of 17 basis points, from 5.77% to 5.60% as well as a $79.2 million decrease in the average balance of loans. The average yield on investment securities decreased 15 basis points, from 2.69% to 2.54%, and the average balance of investment securities decreased $17.3 million. The average yield on total earning assets decreased 23 basis points for the same period, from 4.79% to 4.56%, respectively. The FTE net interest margin decreased 28 basis points in sequential-quarter comparison, from 4.45% for the fourth quarter of 2017 to 4.17% for the first quarter of 2018. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, the FTE net interest margin decreased 22 basis points, from 4.36% for the fourth quarter of 2017 to 4.14% for the first quarter of 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 vs. First Quarter 2017 Earnings Comparison\nMidSouth reported a net loss available to common shareholders of $450,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to net earnings available to common shareholders of $1.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Revenues from consolidated operations decreased $911,000 in quarterly comparison, from $23.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 to $22.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Net interest income decreased $696,000 in quarterly comparison, resulting from a $534,000 decrease in interest income and a $162,000 increase in interest expense. Noninterest income decreased $215,000 in quarterly comparison.\nExcluding non-operating expenses of $5.0 million for the first quarter of 2018, noninterest expenses decreased $391,000 in quarterly comparison and consisted primarily of a $970,000 decrease in salaries and employee benefits costs and a $579,000 decrease in occupancy expense, which were partially offset by a $1.3 million increase in legal and professional fees. The provision for loan losses decreased $2.8 million in quarterly comparison. We recorded an income tax benefit of $34,000 for the first quarter of 2018.\nDividends on preferred stock totaled $810,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and $811,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017.

Dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock totaled $90,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and $91,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nFTE net interest income decreased $828,000 in prior year quarterly comparison. Interest income on loans decreased $607,000 due to a decrease in the average balance of loans of $114.5 million in prior year quarterly comparison. The average yield on loans increased 31 basis points in prior year quarterly comparison, from 5.29% to 5.60%.\nInvestment securities totaled $367.2 million, or 19.8% of total assets at March 31, 2018, versus $390.2 million, or 20.7% of total assets at December 31, 2017. The investment portfolio had an effective duration of 3.6 years and a net unrealized loss of $8.3 million at March 31, 2018. FTE interest income on investments decreased $503,000 in prior year quarterly comparison. The average volume of investment securities decreased $57.8 million in prior year quarterly comparison, and the average tax equivalent yield on investment securities decreased 12 basis points, from 2.66% to 2.54%.\nThe average yield on all earning assets increased 5 basis points in prior year quarterly comparison, from 4.51% for the first quarter of 2017 to 4.56% for the first quarter of 2018.\nInterest expense increased $162,000 in prior year quarterly comparison. Increases in interest expense included a $303,000 increase in interest expense on deposits and a $41,000 increase in interest expense on FHLB advances, which were partially offset by a $194,000 decrease in interest expense on repurchase agreements.\nAs a result of these changes in volume and yield on earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the FTE net interest margin decreased 1 basis point, from 4.18% for the first quarter of 2017 to 4.17% for the first quarter of 2018. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments on loans, deposits and FHLB borrowings, the FTE margin increased 3 basis points, from 4.11% for the first quarter of 2017 to 4.14% for the first quarter of 2018.\nAbout MidSouth Bancorp, Inc.\nMidSouth Bancorp, Inc. is a bank holding company headquartered in Lafayette, Louisiana, with total assets of $1.9 billion as of March 31, 2018.

Note: Prior period information presented above has been adjusted to reflect a reclass of certain credit card income from interest income to non-interest income. MIDSOUTH BANCORP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures (unaudited) (in thousands except per share data) Certain financial information included in the earnings release and the associated Condensed Consolidated Financial Information (unaudited) is determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP. We are providing disclosure of the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. \"Tangible common equity\" is defined as total common equity reduced by intangible assets. \"Core net interest margin\" is defined as reported net interest margin less purchase accounting adjustments. \"Annualized return on average assets, operating\" is defined as net earnings available to common shareholders adjusted for specified one-time items divided by average assets. \"Annualized return on average common equity, operating\" is defined as net earnings available to common shareholders adjusted for specified one-time items divided by average common equity. \"Annualized return on average tangible common equity, operating\" is defined as net earnings available to common shareholders adjusted for specified one-time items divided by average tangible common equity. \"Pre-tax, pre-provision annualized return on average assets, operating\" is defined as pre-tax, pre-provision earnings adjusted for specified one-time items divided by average assets. \"Tangible book value per common share\" is defined as tangible common equity divided by total common shares outstanding. \"Diluted earnings per share, operating\" is defined as net earnings available to common shareholders adjusted for specified one-time items divided by diluted weighted-average shares. The GAAP-based efficiency ratio is measured as noninterest expense as a percentage of net interest income plus noninterest income. The non-GAAP efficiency ratio excludes specified one-time items in addition to securities gains and losses and gains and losses on the sale/valuation of other real estate owned and other assets repossessed. We use non-GAAP measures because we believe they are useful for evaluating our financial condition and performance over periods of time, as well as in managing and evaluating our business and in discussions about our performance. We also believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide users of our financial information with a meaningful measure for assessing our financial condition as well as comparison to financial results for prior periods. These results should not be viewed as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP, and are not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that other companies may use.
