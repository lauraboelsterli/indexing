    "text": "Quarterly revenue of $697 million up 5% year-over-year\nQuarterly GAAP diluted EPS of $0.99; non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.29\nQuarterly GAAP operating margin of 24 percent; non-GAAP operating margin of 32 percent\nRecord cash flow from operations of $358 million\nRepurchased 8.4 million shares in first quarter\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Citrix Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CTXS) today reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancial Results\nFor the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, Citrix achieved revenue of $697 million, compared to $663 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, representing 5 percent revenue growth.\nGAAP Results\nNet income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 was $144 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, compared to $70 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 and 2017 includes restructuring charges of $6 million and $8 million, respectively, for severance and facility closing costs. Additionally, net income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 includes $46 million in charges related to changes in the company’s expectations of the realizability of certain state R&D tax credits resulting from the separation of the GoTo business, partially offset by a tax benefit of approximately $18 million from the adoption of Accounting Standard Update 2016-09 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017.\nNon-GAAP Results\nNon-GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 was $184 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, compared to $152 million, or $0.97 per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 excludes the effects of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, amortization of debt discount, restructuring charges, and the tax effects related to these items. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 also excludes separation costs and the tax effect related to this item and charges related to changes in the company’s expectations of the realizability of certain state R&D tax credits resulting from the separation of the GoTo business. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 also reflects the anti-dilutive impact of the company’s convertible note hedges.\n“This quarter, we delivered strong financial results while at the same time accelerating innovation across our portfolio. Our subscription-based revenue accelerated for the fifth quarter in a row as we are seeing the benefit of transitioning our business model,” said David Henshall, president and CEO of Citrix. “Our focus on integrating the portfolio, with investments in analytics and cloud, position us nicely for the rest of the year.”\nQ1 Financial Summary\nThe results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 are as follows:\nSubscription revenue increased 49 percent; Product and license revenue decreased 6 percent; Support and services revenue increased 3 percent; Net revenue increased in the EMEA region by 7 percent; increased in the Americas region by 5 percent; and decreased in the APJ region by 1 percent; Subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue was 15 percent; Deferred revenue totaled $1.69 billion as of March 31, 2018, compared to $1.66 as of March 31, 2017, an increase of 1 percent; and Cash flow from operations was $358 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared to $292 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2018:\nGAAP gross margin was 84 percent. Non-GAAP gross margin was 86 percent, excluding the effects of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired product related intangible assets; GAAP operating margin was 24 percent. Non-GAAP operating margin was 32 percent, excluding the effects of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and costs associated with restructuring programs; and The company repurchased approximately 8.4 million shares during the first quarter.\nAll results above reflect continuing operations.\nFinancial Outlook for Second Quarter 2018\nCitrix management expects to achieve the following results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018:\nNet revenue is targeted to be in the range of $710 million to $720 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share is targeted to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.76.

These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to acquired intangible assets and debt discount, stock-based compensation expenses, charges associated with the Company’s restructuring programs, separation costs, the related tax effect of those items, and separation-related tax charges or benefits. The income tax effect on non-GAAP items is calculated based upon the tax laws and statutory income tax rates applicable in the tax jurisdiction(s) of the underlying non-GAAP adjustment. The Company also reflects the effect of anti-dilutive convertible note hedges in the number of shares used in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented on a continuing operations basis. The Company's basis for these adjustments is described below.\nManagement uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the Company's performance and to evaluate and compensate the Company's executives. The Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the Company's historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the Company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the Company's operating margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the Company's financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors.\nManagement typically excludes the amounts described above when evaluating the Company's operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the Company's operating performance due to the following factors:\nThe Company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The Company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects that are primarily related to acquisitions, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends. Amortization of intangible assets and the related tax effects are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of the Company's employees and executives, stock-based compensation expense is generally fixed at the time of grant, then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock-based instrument, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant. Under GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash on conversion are required to be accounted for as separate liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components in a manner that reflects the issuer’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. The difference between the imputed interest expense and the coupon interest expense, net of the interest amount capitalized, is excluded from management’s assessment of the company’s operating performance because management believes that the exclusion of these charges will better help investors and financial analysts understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends. The Company has engaged in various restructuring activities over the past several years that have resulted in costs associated with reductions in headcount, consolidation of leased facilities and related costs. Each restructuring activity has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives or circumstances, and each has differed from the others in terms of its operational implementation, business impact and scope. While the Company’s operations previously benefited from the employees and facilities covered by the various restructuring charges, these employees and facilities have benefited different parts of the Company’s business in different ways, and the amount of these charges has varied significantly from period to period. The Company, therefore, believes that the exclusion of these charges will better help investors and financial analysts understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends as compared to prior periods. Separation costs represent transaction and transition costs associated with preparing businesses for independent operations consisting primarily of financial advisory fees, legal fees, accounting fees, tax services and information systems infrastructure duplication. These charges are not anticipated to be ongoing costs; and, thus, are outside of the normal operations of the Company's business. As such, the Company believes that these expenses do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of continuing operations for the period in which they are incurred. The Company has convertible note hedges in place to offset potential dilution from the embedded conversion feature in its convertible notes. For GAAP diluted earnings per share purposes, the Company cannot reflect the anti-dilutive impact of the convertible note hedges. The Company believes that reflecting the anti-dilutive impact of the convertible note hedges in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share provides investors with useful information in evaluating the financial performance of the Company on a per share basis. Separation-related tax charges or benefits, which may include reversals of certain state R&D credits due to changes in expectations of realizability as a result of the separation of a significant business of the Company. The Company believes that these items do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of continuing operations for the period in which they are incurred.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\") and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income and earnings per share) and should not be considered measures of the Company's liquidity.\nCITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation\n(In thousands, except per share, gross margin and operating margin data - unaudited)\nThe following tables show the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nGAAP gross margin 84.5% Add: stock-based compensation 0.2 Add: amortization of product related intangible assets 1.6 Non-GAAP gross margin 86.3% Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nGAAP operating margin 23.7% Add: stock-based compensation 5.2 Add: amortization of product related intangible assets 1.6 Add: amortization of other intangible assets 0.5 Add: restructuring charges 0.9 Non-GAAP operating margin 31.9% Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 GAAP net income from continuing operations $144,259 $70,325 Add: stock-based compensation 35,723 34,808 Add: amortization of product related intangible assets 11,029 13,088 Add: amortization of other intangible assets 3,666 3,646 Add: amortization of debt discount 8,706 8,410 Add: separation costs — 298 Add: restructuring charges 6,187 7,986 Less: tax effects related to above items (25,946) (33,077) Add: separation related tax charges — 46,127 Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations $183,624 $151,611 Three Months Ended March 31,\n2018 2017 Number of shares used in diluted earnings per share\ncalculations:\nGAAP weighted average shares outstanding 146,388 158,369 Less: effect of convertible note hedges (4,360 ) (1,676 ) Non-GAAP weighted average shares outstanding 142,028 156,693\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations - diluted $0.99 $0.44 Add: stock-based compensation 0.25 0.22 Add: amortization of product related intangible assets 0.07 0.09 Add: amortization of other intangible assets 0.03 0.02 Add: amortization of debt discount 0.06 0.06 Add: restructuring charges 0.04 0.05 Less: tax effects related to above items (0.18) (0.21) Add: separation related tax charges — 0.30 Less: effect of convertible note hedges 0.03 — Non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations - diluted $1.29 $0.97 Forward Looking Guidance\nFor the Three\nMonths Ended\nJune 30,\nFor the Twelve\nMonths Ended\nDecember 31,\n2018 2018 GAAP earnings per share - diluted $0.72 to $0.76 $3.45 to $3.59 Add: adjustments to exclude the effects of amortization of intangible assets 0.11 0.44 Add: adjustments to exclude the effects of expenses related to stock-based compensation\n0.40 1.51 Add: adjustments to exclude the effects of amortization of debt discount 0.06 0.25 Add: adjustments to exclude the effects of restructuring charges 0.01 0.09 Less: tax effects related to above items (0.08 to 0.16) (0.44 to 0.68) Non-GAAP earnings per share - diluted $1.18 to $1.22 $5.20 to $5.30 For the Twelve\nMonths Ended\nDecember 31,\n2018\nGAAP operating margin 20.2% to 21.2% Add: stock-based compensation 7.2 Add: amortization of intangible assets 2.1 Add: restructuring charges 0.4 Non-GAAP operating margin 30.0% to 31.0%\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180425006472/en/\nCitrix Systems, Inc.\nFor media inquiries\nEric Armstrong, 954-267-2977\neric.armstrong@citrix.com\nor\nFor investor inquiries:\nEduardo Fleites, 954-229-5758\neduardo.fleites@citrix.com\nSource: Citrix Systems, Inc.",
