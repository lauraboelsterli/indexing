    "text": "ATLANTA, April 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Streamline Health Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ: STRM), provider of integrated solutions, technology-enabled services and analytics supporting revenue cycle optimization for healthcare enterprises in the new value-based world, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2017, which ended January 31, 2018.\nRevenues for the three-month period ended January 31, 2018 were $6.1 million, a decline of approximately 5% as compared to the three-months ended January 31, 2017. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $1.2 million, up appreciably over the $535,000 in the fourth quarter a year ago. Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $38,000, an improvement over the $1.0 million net loss in the same period a year ago.\nRevenues for fiscal year 2017 were $24.3 million, down approximately 10% from the previous fiscal year. Recurring revenues for the year constituted 80% of overall revenue, or $19.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal year was $2.8 million, down slightly from $2.9 million in fiscal year 2016.\n\"Fiscal year 2017 was the beginning of our new, more narrowly focused efforts to sell solutions and services in the middle of the revenue cycle – improving healthcare providers' coding accuracy to help them capture the financial reimbursement they deserve for the patient care they have provided,\" stated David Sides, President and Chief Executive Officer, Streamline Health. \"We are committed to leading an industry movement to improve hospitals' financial performance by moving mid-cycle billing interventions upstream - to improve coding accuracy before billing, enabling our clients to reduce lost revenue, mitigate overbill risk, and reduce denials and days in accounts receivable. This enables providers to turn unpredictable revenue cycles into dynamic revenue streams.\nBy narrowing our focus to the middle of the revenue cycle we won 15 new clients in 2017. We believe we have a more distinct and compelling value proposition that can help us win more often. And not just with hospitals, but with outpatient centers and clinics and physician practices as well. Our coding solutions and services like CDI and Abstracting are established performers, and they were the primary contributors to a strong start to this new year. Our new eValuator coding analysis platform helped us win more new clients last year. The eValuator technology is right for the market which is driving new attention to Streamline Health. Our current client base continues to show interest in eValuator, but we have an even greater number of new clients than existing clients signing up for the solution.\nImportantly, we have instigated and maintained tight cost and investment controls so that the transition to focusing our efforts in the middle of the revenue cycle has not negatively affected our balance sheet.\"\nHighlights for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 included:\nRevenues for the fourth quarter 2017 were $6.1 million, and for the year were $24.3 million; Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter 2017 was $1.2 million, and for the year was $2.8 million; Recorded net income of $38,000 for the fourth quarter ended January 31, 2018, and a net loss of $(3.1) million for the fiscal year 2017; New sales bookings for the quarter were $1.2 million and $4.8 million for the fiscal year; and Backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was $33 million.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will conduct a conference call to review the results on Thursday, April 26, 2018 at 9:00 AM ET.

Streamline Health's management also evaluates and makes operating decisions using various other measures. One such measure is adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Streamline Health's management believes that this measure provides useful supplemental information regarding the performance of Streamline Health's business operations.\nStreamline Health defines \"adjusted EBITDA\" as net earnings (loss) plus interest expense, tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense of tangible and intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, significant non-recurring operating expenses, and transactional related expenses including: gains and losses on debt and equity conversions, associate severances and related restructuring expenses, associate inducements, and professional and advisory fees. A table reconciling this measure to net income is included in this press release.\nAbout Streamline Health\nStreamline Health Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ: STRM) is a healthcare industry leader in capturing, aggregating, and translating enterprise data into knowledge­ – producing actionable insights that support revenue cycle optimization for healthcare enterprises.

financial measure under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for Adjusted EBITDA. This non-GAAP information supplements and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles. Non-GAAP financial measures are used internally to manage the business, such as in establishing an annual operating budget. Streamline Health's management in its operating and financial decision-making uses non-GAAP financial measures because management believes these measures reflect ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Accordingly, the Company believes it is useful for investors and others to review both GAAP and non-GAAP measures in order to (a) understand and evaluate current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does and (b) compare in a consistent manner the Company's current financial results with past financial results. The primary limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures are that these measures may not be directly comparable to the amounts reported by other companies and they do not include all items of income and expense that affect operations. The Company's management compensates for these limitations by considering the Company's financial results and outlook as determined in accordance with GAAP and by providing a detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables attached to this press release. Streamline Health defines \"Adjusted EBITDA\" as net earnings (loss) plus interest expense, tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense of tangible and intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, significant non-recurring operating expenses, and transactional related expenses including: gains and losses on debt and equity conversions, associate severances and related restructuring expenses, associate inducements, professional and advisory fees, and internal direct costs incurred to complete transactions.\nReconciliation of net earnings (loss) to non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):\nAdjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\nThree Months Ended,\nTwelve Months Ended,\nJanuary\n31, 2018\nJanuary\n31, 2017\nJanuary\n31, 2018\nJanuary\n31, 2017\nNet Income (loss)\n$\n38\n$\n(1,020)\n$\n(3,099)\n$\n(5,162)\nInterest expense\n114\n128\n475\n509\nIncome tax benefit\n(92)\n(17)\n(84)\n(12)\nDepreciation\n178\n205\n774\n1,100\nAmortization of capitalized software development costs\n539\n625\n2,113\n2,771\nAmortization of intangible assets\n239\n369\n1,161\n1,345\nAmortization of other costs\n93\n114\n270\n254\nEBITDA\n1,109\n404\n1,610\n805\nShare-based compensation expense\n264\n444\n1,109\n1,787\nGain on sale of business\n--\n(238)\n--\n(238)\nLoss (Gain) on disposal of fixed assets\n(1)\n--\n(16)\n1\nNon-cash valuation adjustments to assets and liabilities\n(134)\n(149)\n95\n(65)\nTransaction related professional fees, advisory fees and\nother internal direct costs\n--\n34\n--\n392\nAssociate severances and other costs relating to\ntransactions or corporate restructuring\n--\n40\n--\n239\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n1,238\n$\n535\n$\n2,798\n$\n2,921\nAdjusted EBITDA per diluted share\nLoss per share – diluted\n$\n0.00\n$\n(0.05)\n$\n(0.16)\n$\n(0.31)\nAdjusted EBITDA per adjusted diluted share (1)\n$\n0.05\n$\n0.02\n$\n0.12\n$\n0.13\nDiluted weighted average shares\n23,241,521\n19,680,751\n19,876,383\n19,528,341\nIncludable incremental shares — Adjusted EBITDA (2)\n--\n3,340,390\n3,244,825\n3,327,130\nAdjusted diluted shares\n23,241,521\n23,021,141\n23,121,208\n22,855,471\n(1)\nAdjusted EBITDA per adjusted diluted share for the Company's common stock is computed using the more dilutive of the two-class method or the if-converted method.\n(2)\nThe number of incremental shares that would be dilutive under profit assumption, only applicable under a GAAP net loss.
