    "text": "NORTHBROOK, Ill., April 18, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- KapStone Paper and Packaging Corporation (NYSE:KS) today reported results for the first 2018. As compared to 2017's first quarter, results for 2018's first quarter are below:\nNet sales of $799 million up $33 million, or 4 percent Net income of $33 million up $27 million, or 446 percent Diluted EPS of $0.33 up $0.27 per share, or 450 percent\nNon U.S. GAAP financial measures for the 2018 first quarter compared to 2017 are as follows:\nAdjusted EBITDA of $115 million up $34 million, or 42 percent Adjusted net income of $42 million up $27 million, or 181 percent Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.43 up $0.28 per share, or 187 percent\nMatt Kaplan, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"Our first quarter results continued the positive momentum we built in the latter half of 2017. Demand for containerboard, corrugated boxes, and kraft paper is strong. We announced a $50 per ton containerboard price increase effective with shipments in mid-March. In addition, we completed a rebuild of one of our boilers at the North Charleston mill which should provide for greater reliability and more efficient operations.\n\"Victory Packaging, our distribution business, had a solid first quarter and is entering its seasonally strongest quarter of the year.\n\"We continue to work on the merger with WestRock.\"\nFirst Quarter Operating Highlights\nConsolidated net sales of $799 million in the first quarter of 2018 increased by $33 million, or 4 percent compared to $766 million for the 2017 first quarter. The increase in net sales is primarily due to higher prices, partially offset by lower sales volume. The Company sold 662,000 tons of paper during the first quarter of 2018 compared to 699,000 tons a year earlier. Volume was lower in the current quarter as mill production was limited due to a boiler upgrade at the Charleston mill which reduced production by approximately 26,000 tons. The Company's average mill selling price of $719 per ton in the first quarter of 2018 increased by $71 per ton, or about 11 percent compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to higher prices for most products and a favorable product mix. Mill selling prices increased by $21 per ton or 3 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 due to higher specialty product prices and a better product mix.\nNet income of $33 million for the 2018 first quarter increased by $27 million, or 446 percent, compared to the 2017 first quarter. The higher earnings primarily reflects:\nHigher selling prices and a better product mix of $48 million, Favorable productivity of $10 million mainly due to higher mill production, Lower recycled fiber costs of $6 million, Non-recurring 2017 costs of $5 million associated with ratifying a union contract at the North Charleston paper mill, A $7 million gain on the sale of the former Oakland box plant site, and A lower effective income tax rate resulting from the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December 2017.\nThe above items were partially offset by:\nMerger expenses of $14 million, Lower sales volume of $7 million, $8 million of higher planned maintenance costs, including the boiler upgrade, Inflation of $15 million driven by higher virgin fiber costs, freight and compensation, $4 million of weather related costs in January 2018 at the North Charleston mill, and Higher interest charges of $4 million due to higher interest rates.\nCash Flow and Working Capital\nCash and cash equivalents of $19 million as of March 31, 2018, declined by $9 million from December 31, 2017. Operating activities provided $5 million during the first quarter. Investing activities used $22 million, including $37 million for capital expenditures, partially offset by $15 million of proceeds from the sale of the former Oakland box plant site. Financing activities provided $8 million of cash in the current quarter reflecting higher borrowings, partially offset by a quarterly dividend payment and the Victory Packaging contingent consideration payment.\nOn February 23, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a regular $0.10 per share cash dividend which was paid on April 11th.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $431 million of working capital and $466 million of revolver borrowing capacity. The Company's net debt to EBITDA ratio as defined by the bank agreement decreased to 2.96 times at March 31, 2018, down from 3.99 a year ago.\nAbout the Company\nHeadquartered in Northbrook, IL, KapStone Paper and Packaging Corporation is the fifth largest producer of containerboard and corrugated packaging products and is the largest kraft paper producer in the United States. The Company has four paper mills, 23 converting plants and over 60 distribution centers. The business has approximately 6,300 employees.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including \"EBITDA\", \"Adjusted EBITDA\", \"Adjusted Net Income\", and \"Adjusted Diluted EPS\" to measure our operating performance. Management uses these measures to focus on the on-going operations, and believes it is useful to investors because they enable them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results. The Company believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors because they improve the comparability of the financial results between periods and provide for greater transparency to key measures used to evaluate the performance of the Company. Management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for evaluating the Company's performance against competitors and as a primary measure for employees' incentive programs. Reconciliations of Net Income to EBITDA, EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA, Net Income to Adjusted Net Income, and Diluted EPS to Adjusted Diluted EPS are included in the financial schedules contained in this press release. However, these measures should not be construed as an alternative to any other measure of performance determined in accordance with GAAP.\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements in this news release that are not historical are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
