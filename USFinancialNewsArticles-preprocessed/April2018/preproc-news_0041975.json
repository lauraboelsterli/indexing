The integration, which follows five consecutive years of 50%+ growth for Examity, will expand the company's reach to serve a global customer base with more than 100 new partnerships across the United States and Europe.\n\"With nearly one-third of all college students taking at least one course online, colleges and universities are looking for flexible, mobile, and comprehensive strategies to ensure the integrity of testing,\" said Michael London, Founder and CEO of Examity, who was recently named to Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker's Commission on Digital Innovation and Lifelong Learning. \"We're playing a critical role in promoting not just security, but also quality, as digital learning takes hold on campus and in the world of work. I am incredibly proud of the success of our team to date, and look forward to Examity's continued growth as we work to create secure, authentic online learning opportunities.\"\nRecent research indicates that online education in the U.S. continues to accelerate. More than 30 percent of all college students now take at least one online course. The rise of online learning has led to fast growth in the proctoring market as universities and employers work to ensure the integrity of online assessments.

The company, which raised $21 million in 2017 from leading higher education technology investor University Ventures, already works with more than 300 colleges and universities, including Boston University, Penn State, and Yale. In conjunction with the acquisition, Examity will launch a new office in Atlanta in addition to its growing Boston-based team.\nAbout Examity\nExamity was founded to meet the needs of the growing number of online education and certification programs looking to ensure integrity.
