    "text": "ABBOTT PARK, Ill., April 18, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Abbott (NYSE: ABT) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst-quarter worldwide sales of $7.4 billion increased 16.7 percent on a reported basis and 6.9 percent on an organic * basis. Reported diluted EPS from continuing operations under GAAP was $0.23 in the first quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations, which excludes specified items, was $0.59, at the upper end of Abbott's previous guidance range. Abbott projects full-year 2018 diluted EPS from continuing operations of $1.23 to $1.33 on a GAAP basis 1 . Projected full-year adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations remains $2.80 to $2.90, reflecting 14.0 percent growth at the midpoint. In January, Abbott announced U.S. FDA approval for magnetic resonance (MR)-conditional labeling for its Quadra Assura TM and Quadra Assura MP TM cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) devices and its Fortify Assura TM implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). With these approvals, Abbott has MR-conditional labeling for its suite of pacemaker, ICD and CRT-D devices. In January, Abbott announced that FreeStyle ® Libre, Abbott's revolutionary sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring system, is now available and approved for coverage by the U.S. Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. In March, Abbott announced clinical trial data from the MOMENTUM 3 study, which demonstrated that its HeartMate 3 TM left ventricular assist device (LVAD) improved survival and clinical outcomes at two years for patients with advanced heart failure. The trial data will be submitted to the U.S. FDA to support consideration to expand the current HeartMate 3 indication to include long-term use.\n\"We're off to a strong start to the year as we forecasted,\" said Miles D. White, chairman and chief executive officer, Abbott. \"We're particularly pleased with the continued strong growth in Medical Devices and improving performance in our Nutrition business.\"\n* See note on organic growth below.\nFIRST-QUARTER BUSINESS OVERVIEW\nNote: Management believes that measuring sales growth rates on an organic basis is an appropriate way for investors to best understand the underlying performance of the business.\nOrganic sales growth:\nExcludes prior year results for the Abbott Medical Optics (AMO) and St. Jude Medical vascular closure businesses, which were divested during the first quarter 2017; Excludes the current and prior year results for Rapid Diagnostics, which reflect results for Alere Inc., which was acquired on Oct. 3, 2017; and Excludes the impact of foreign exchange.\nFollowing are sales by business segment and commentary for the first quarter:\nTotal Company\n($ in millions)\n% Change vs. 1Q17\nSales 1Q18\nReported\nOrganic\nU.S.\nInt'l\nTotal\nU.S.\nInt'l\nTotal\nU.S.\nInt'l\nTotal\nTotal *\n2,675\n4,715\n7,390\n15.1\n17.6\n16.7\n5.0\n8.0\n6.9\nNutrition\n758\n998\n1,756\n3.8\n9.5\n7.0\n3.8\n5.5\n4.7\nDiagnostics\n700\n1,137\n1,837\n89.2\n44.3\n58.7\n1.8\n7.3\n5.5\nEstablished Pharmaceuticals\n--\n1,044\n1,044\nn/a\n9.9\n9.9\nn/a\n6.8\n6.8\nMedical Devices\n1,209\n1,535\n2,744\n6.4\n22.0\n14.6\n6.9\n11.7\n9.4\n* Total 2018 Abbott sales from continuing operations include Other Sales of $9 million.\nn/a = Not Applicable.\nNote: In order to compute results excluding the impact of exchange rates, current year U.S. dollar sales are multiplied or divided, as appropriate, by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then those amounts are multiplied or divided, as appropriate, by the prior year average foreign exchange rates.\nFirst-quarter 2018 worldwide sales of $7.4 billion increased 16.7 percent on a reported basis.

On an organic basis, sales increased 9.4 percent. Refer to tables titled \"Non-GAAP Reconciliation of Adjusted Historical Revenue\" for a reconciliation of adjusted historical revenue.\nIn Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation, worldwide sales growth in the first quarter was led by double-digit growth in Electrophysiology and Neuromodulation. Growth in Electrophysiology includes share gains from the recent U.S. launch of Abbott's Confirm Rx TM Insertable Cardiac Monitor (ICM), the world's first and only smartphone-compatible ICM designed to help physicians remotely identify cardiac arrhythmias. In Heart Failure, sales growth was led by market uptake of Abbott's HeartMate 3 system. In the quarter, Abbott announced clinical trial data from the MOMENTUM 3 study demonstrating that its HeartMate 3 LVAD improved survival and clinical outcomes at 2 years for patients with advanced heart failure. The trial data will be submitted to the U.S. FDA to support consideration to expand the current HeartMate 3 indication to include long-term use. Growth in Structural Heart was driven by MitraClip ® , Abbott's market-leading device for the minimally-invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation. In March, Abbott announced MitraClip was granted national reimbursement in Japan, which enables greater access for patients to this life-altering therapy. In Neuromodulation, strong double-digit growth was led by a portfolio of recently launched products for the treatment of chronic pain and movement disorders.\nIn Diabetes Care, worldwide sales increased 44.2 percent on a reported basis in the first quarter, including a favorable 11.3 percent effect of foreign exchange, and increased 32.9 percent on an organic basis. Strong double-digit growth was led by FreeStyle Libre, Abbott's revolutionary sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system, which removes the need for routine fingersticks 2 for people with diabetes. During the quarter, Abbott announced that the FreeStyle LibreLink 3,4 app is available in Europe for use with compatible smartphones, which allows people to access glucose data directly from their phones and eliminates the need to carry a separate scanning device.\nABBOTT'S FULL-YEAR EARNINGS-PER-SHARE GUIDANCE\nAbbott projects 2018 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) of $1.23 to $1.33.\nAbbott forecasts net specified items for the full year 2018 of approximately $1.57 per share. Specified items include intangible amortization expense, acquisition-related expenses, charges associated with cost reduction initiatives and other expenses.\nExcluding specified items, projected adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations would be $2.80 to $2.90 for the full year 2018.\nAbbott is issuing second-quarter 2018 guidance for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations under GAAP of $0.33 to $0.35. Abbott forecasts specified items for the second quarter 2018 of $0.37 primarily related to intangible amortization, acquisition-related expenses, cost reduction initiatives and other expenses. Excluding specified items, projected adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations would be $0.70 to $0.72 for the second quarter.\nABBOTT DECLARES 377 TH CONSECUTIVE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND\nOn Feb. 16, 2018, the board of directors of Abbott declared the company's quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share.
