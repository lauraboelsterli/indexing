    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s largest oil producer Rosneft is interested in oil and gas projects in Iran’s Zagros province, after signing a deal last year to do business in the country, an official document showed on Friday.\nThe logo of Russia's oil producer Rosneft is seen on a board at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum 2017 (SPIEF 2017) in St. Petersburg, Russia, June 1, 2017. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin The document, published on a government website that details tenders by state companies, said that as of mid-February Rosneft planned to assess the prospects for exploration and production projects in Zagros. No other details were given.\nLast year, Rosneft and the National Iranian Oil Company agreed an outline deal to work together on a number of “strategic” projects in Iran worth up to a combined $30 billion.\nThe potential collaboration with Iran would strengthen Rosneft’s position in the Middle East where it has already secured a number of deals, including the acquisition of a majority stake in Iraqi Kurdistan’s main oil pipeline.\nReporting by Rinat Sagdiev; writing by Vladimir Soldatkin and Susan Fenton\n ",
