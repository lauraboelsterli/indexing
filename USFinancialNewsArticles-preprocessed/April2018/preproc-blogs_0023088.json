    "text": "1 Hour Ago | 02:54 \nStocks climbed off session lows on Wednesday, boosted by gains in tech and energy as investors looked ahead to the start of the latest earnings season. \nThe Dow Jones industrial average traded 73 points lower after falling more than 200 points, with DowDuPont as the biggest decliner. The S&P 500 teetered around the flatline as of 12:28 p.m. ET, with energy rising 1 percent. The index fell as much as 0.6 percent. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.3 percent after trading lower, as Netflix rose nearly 4 percent. \nConcho Resources was among the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500, rising 4 percent. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) rallied more than 1 percent. \nStocks also got a boost off their lows as tech shares recovered. The sector rose 0.2 percent after trading lower. \nThe major indexes initially fell Wednesday after President Donald Trump taunted Russia on Twitter to \"get ready\" for a possible missile strike on Syria. \nTrump said in a tweet : \"Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and 'smart!' You shouldn't be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!\" Tweet \nSafe havens like gold and U.S. Treasurys rose on the news. Crude oil prices also spiked higher. \n\"It's not that this wasn't expected. Trump had already hinted at a response,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \"I think the market was caught offguard by the tone of the response.\" \nThe president's threat comes after Russia's ambassador to Lebanon told local media that Russia would shoot down American missiles headed Syria's way. This follows an alleged chemical weapons attack by President Bashar Assad that killed dozens in a rebel-held area over the weekend. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York. \n\"Even though these events will impact near-term volatility, the market will come back to focus on earnings,\" said Ernie Cecilia, CIO at Bryn Mawr Trust. \nBlackRock and Delta Air Lines kick off the first-quarter earnings season on Thursday, with J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo scheduled to report Friday. \nInvestors have high expectations for this earnings season. According to FactSet, S&P 500 earnings are forecast to have grown by 17.1 percent last quarter. That would be the biggest quarterly earnings growth since the first quarter of 2011, when they rose 19.5 percent. \nThe moves Wednesday came after Wall Street saw strong gains during Tuesday's session, with the Dow rallying more than 400 points to close up at 24,408. \nMarket sentiment was upbeat Tuesday after Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed plans to further open up his country's economy, suggesting measures that included lowering import tariffs on products including autos. \nIn data, the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's March meeting are due to be released at 2 p.m. ET. No speeches by the Federal Reserve are scheduled for Wednesday. \nShares of Netflix popped after analysts at Goldman Sachs hiked their price target on the stock to $360 from $315. \nâ€”CNBC's Sara Salinas contributed to this report.
