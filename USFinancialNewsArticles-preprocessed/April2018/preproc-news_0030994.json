    "text": "BERRYVILLE, Va., April 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Eagle Financial Services, Inc. (OTCQX: EFSI), the holding company for Bank of Clarke County, whose divisions include Eagle Investment Group, reported increased quarterly earnings and continued strong performance for the first quarter of 2018. On April 18, 2018, the Board of Directors announced a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.23 per common share, payable on May 14, 2018, to shareholders of record on April 30, 2018. Select highlights for the first quarter include:\nNet income of $2.5 million Loan growth of $12.8 million Deposit growth of $22.2 million Basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.73 Net interest margin of 4.05%\nJohn R. Milleson, President and CEO, stated, \"Not only am I proud to announce that the Company delivered strong results for the first quarter of 2018, but also that the Bank of Clarke County has been named the best bank in the Northern Shenandoah Valley and Loudoun County. These accolades come from the results of online surveys conducted by the Northern Virginian Daily and Loudoun Times Mirror. I considered these recognitions particularly special because they reflect acceptance by the communities in which we operate and validation of the efforts of our talented and energetic staff who not only perform their daily duties but are true contributors to their communities.\"\nIncome Statement Review\nNet income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $2.5 million reflecting an increase of 48.6% from the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and an increase of 24.2% from the quarter ended March 31, 2017. These increases are mostly attributed to a $397,000 gain recognized on the foreclosure of residential real estate loan collateral as other real estate owned and to the decrease in income tax expense. Because the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017, the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities were adjusted at December 31, 2017, for the effect of the change in the corporate tax rate. This adjustment resulted in a net increase to federal income tax expense of $430,152 during the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Net income was $1.7 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 and $2.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nNet interest income was $7.0 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Net interest income was $6.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increase in interest income from loans was the biggest contributor to the increase in net interest income when comparing the quarter ended March 31, 2018 to the same period in 2017.\nTotal loan interest income was $6.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, reflecting an increase of $112,000 from the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Total loan interest income was $5.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Average loans for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $575.4 million compared to $562.5 million at December 31, 2017. Total average accruing loans were $571.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and $557.2 million at December 31, 2017. For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, total average loans were $518.3 million and average accruing loans were $511.8 million. The tax equivalent yield on average loans for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was 4.62%, an increase of seven basis points from 4.55% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and an increase of 11 basis points from the 4.51% average yield at March 31, 2017. Interest and dividend income from the investment portfolio was $881,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and $846,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Average investments were $130.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and $128.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Average investments were $125.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 and interest and dividend income was $809,000 for that same period.\nTotal interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $426,000, an increase of $74,000 from the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Total interest expense increased $223,000 when comparing the quarter ended March 31, 2018 to the same period in 2017. Much of that increase resulted from increased deposit rates on several bank deposit products. The average cost of interest bearing liabilities increased seven basis points when comparing the quarter ended March 31, 2018 to the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased $6.0 million from the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The average cost of interest bearing liabilities increased 19 basis points when comparing the quarter ended March 31, 2018 to the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased $30.8 million from the quarter ended March 31, 2017. As interest rates continue to rise, the Company will continue to steadfastly manage the cost of its interest-bearing deposits. The net interest margin was 4.05% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and 4.03% for the quarter December 31, 2017. For the quarter ended March 31, 2017 the net interest margin was 4.09%.\nThe Company's net interest margin is not a measurement under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, but it is a common measure used by the financial services industry to determine how profitably earning assets are funded. The Company's net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by total average earning assets. Tax equivalent net interest income is calculated by grossing up interest income for the amounts that are non-taxable (i.e., municipal income) then subtracting interest expense. The tax rate utilized is 21%.\nNoninterest income was $1.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and $1.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Noninterest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was $1.7 million.\nNoninterest expense was $5.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. This represents a decrease of $193,000 or 3.3% from $5.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Much of this decrease resulted from a $397,000 gain recognized upon the foreclosure of residential real estate collateral during the quarter. On February 14, 2018, the Bank took ownership of an approximate 38-acre residential property located in Northern Loudoun County, Virginia. The property has a current appraised value of $3.4 million and after consideration of estimated selling costs, was recorded as other real estate owned of $3.2 million. Additionally, approximately $130,000 in other real estate owned expenses were incurred with this foreclosure during the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Noninterest expense decreased $79,000 or 1.4% when comparing the quarter ended March 31, 2018 to the same time period in 2017.\nIncome tax expense was $476,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. This represents a decrease of $721,000 or 60.2% from $1.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Much of this decrease resulted from the adjustment of $430,152 to federal income tax expense during the quarter ended December 31, 2017 in response to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act being signed into law on December 22, 2017. Income tax expense decreased $334,000 or 41.2% when comparing the quarter ended March 31, 2018 to the same period in 2017. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company expects to be subject to a lower income tax rate.\nAsset Quality and Provision for Loan Losses\nNonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans, loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing, other real estate owned (foreclosed properties), and repossessed assets. Nonperforming assets decreased from $6.4 million or 0.84% of total assets at December 31, 2017 to $5.1 million or 0.66% of total assets at March 31, 2018. This decrease resulted mostly from decreases in nonaccrual loans. Non-performing assets were $6.4 million or 0.91% of total assets at March 31, 2017. During the first quarter of 2018, five loans totaling approximately $4.5 million were removed from nonaccrual status by fact of being paid off or charged off, and one loan totaling $156,000 was placed on non-accrual status. Other changes to non-accrual loan balances resulted from loan payments. Management evaluates the financial condition of these borrowers and the value of any collateral on these loans. The results of these evaluations are used to estimate the amount of losses which may be realized on the disposition of these nonaccrual loans. At March 31, 2018, the Bank had $18,000 of loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing. At December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2017, the Bank had no loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing. Other real estate owned was $3.3 million at March 31, 2018 and $106,000 at December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017. On February 14, 2018, the Bank took ownership of an approximate 38-acre residential property located in Northern Loudoun County, Virginia. The property has a current appraised value of $3.4 million and after consideration of estimated selling costs was recorded as other real estate owned of $3.2 million.\nThe Company may, under certain circumstances, restructure loans in troubled debt restructurings as a concession to a borrower when the borrower is experiencing financial distress. Formal, standardized loan restructuring programs are not utilized by the Company. Each loan considered for restructuring is evaluated based on customer circumstances and may include modifications to one or more loan provision. Such restructured loans are included in impaired loans but may not necessarily be nonperforming loans. At March 31, 2018, the Company had 19 troubled debt restructurings totaling $4.3 million. All but one of the restructured loans are performing loans.\nThe Company realized $86,000 in net charge offs for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 versus $98,000 in net charge-offs for the three months ended December 31, 2017. The Company realized $440,000 in net recoveries for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The amount of provision for loan losses reflects the results of the Bank's analysis used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The provisions for loan losses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, were $205,000 and $134,000, respectively. The Company had negative provisions for loan losses of $527,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans was 0.78% at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans was 0.85% at March 31, 2017. The ratio of allowance for loan losses to total nonaccrual loans was 251.7% at March 31, 2018. The ratio of allowance for loan losses to total nonaccrual loans was 69.6% and 69.7% at December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively. At March 31, 2018, impaired loans totaled $6.7 million and had related specific allocations of $326,000. At December 31, 2017, impaired loans totaled $11.4 million and had related specific allocations of $458,000. At March 31, 2017, total impaired loans were $12.0 million and required specific allocations of $366,000.\nTotal Consolidated Assets\nTotal consolidated assets of the Company at March 31, 2018 were $775.9 million, which represented an increase of $10.1 million or 1.32% from total assets of $765.8 million at December 31, 2017. At March 31, 2017, total consolidated assets were $705.1 million. Securities available for sale decreased $3.7 million from $133.7 million at December 31, 2017. Total loans increased from $568.8 million at December 31, 2017 to $581.6 million at March 31, 2018. At March 31, 2017, total investment securities were $132.4 million and total loans were $519.4 million.\nDeposits and Other Borrowings\nTotal deposits increased $22.2 million from $663.4 million at December 31, 2017 to $685.6 million at March 31, 2018. At March 31, 2017, total deposits were $615.9 million. The Company held no brokered deposits for any of the above-mentioned periods.\nThe Company had no borrowings with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta at March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017.\nEquity\nShareholders' equity at March 31, 2018 was $83.1 million and $83.8 million at December 31, 2017. Shareholder's equity was $80.5 million at March 31, 2017. The book value of the Company at March 31, 2018 was $24.12 per common share. Total common shares outstanding were 3,466,117 at March 31, 2018. On April 18, 2018, the board of directors declared a $0.23 per common share cash dividend for shareholders of record as of April 30, 2018 and payable on May 14, 2018.\nCertain information contained in this discussion may include \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Tax equivalent interest income is calculated by grossing up interest income for the amounts that are non taxable (i.e., municipal income) then subtracting interest expense. The rate utilized is 21%. See the table below for the quarterly tax equivalent net interest income and the reconciliation of net interest income to tax equivalent net interest income. The Company's net interest margin is a common measure used by the financial service industry to determine how profitable earning assets are funded. Because the Company earns a fair amount of non taxable interest income due to the mix of securities in its investment security portfolio, net interest income for the ratio is calculated on a tax equivalent basis as described above.\n(2)\nThe efficiency ratio is not a measurement under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. It is calculated by dividing non-interest expense by the sum of tax equivalent net interest income and non-interest income excluding gains and losses on the investment portfolio and sales of repossessed assets. The tax rate utilized is 21%. See the table below for the quarterly tax equivalent net interest income and a reconciliation of net interest income to tax equivalent net interest income. The Company calculates this ratio in order to evaluate its overhead structure or how effectively it is operating. An increase in the ratio from period to period indicates the Company is losing a larger percentage of its income to expenses. The Company believes that the efficiency ratio is a reasonable measure of profitability.\nEAGLE FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC.\nSELECTED FINANCIAL DATA BY QUARTER\n1Q18\n4Q17\n3Q17\n2Q17\n1Q17\nBALANCE SHEET RATIOS\nLoans to deposits\n84.83%\n85.74%\n85.57%\n87.69%\n83.61%\nAverage interest-earning assets to\naverage-interest bearing liabilities\n166.80%\n165.83%\n162.10%\n162.04%\n162.59%\nPER SHARE DATA\nDividends\n$ 0.23\n$ 0.22\n$ 0.22\n$ 0.22\n$ 0.22\nBook value\n24.12\n24.40\n24.31\n24.02\n23.32\nTangible book value\n24.12\n24.40\n24.31\n24.02\n23.32\nSHARE PRICE DATA\nClosing price\n$ 32.80\n$ 32.00\n$ 29.25\n$ 31.25\n$ 28.40\nDiluted earnings multiple(1)\n11.23\n16.33\n12.61\n13.47\n12.03\nBook value multiple(2)\n1.36\n1.31\n1.20\n1.30\n1.22\nCOMMON STOCK DATA\nOutstanding shares at end of period\n3,466,117\n3,449,027\n3,456,430\n3,481,946\n3,476,553\nWeighted average shares outstanding\n3,463,118\n3,468,275\n3,469,372\n3,474,628\n3,478,053\nWeighted average shares outstanding, diluted\n3,463,118\n3,468,275\n3,469,372\n3,474,628\n3,478,053\nCAPITAL RATIOS\nTotal equity to total assets\n10.71%\n10.95%\n11.31%\n11.18%\n11.42%\nCREDIT QUALITY\nNet charge-offs to average loans\n0.06%\n0.07%\n-0.03%\n-0.16%\n-0.34%\nTotal non-performing loans to total loans\n0.31%\n1.11%\n0.92%\n1.01%\n1.23%\nTotal non-performing assets to total assets\n0.66%\n0.84%\n0.71%\n0.77%\n0.91%\nNon-accrual loans to:\ntotal loans\n0.31%\n1.11%\n0.92%\n1.01%\n1.23%\ntotal assets\n0.23%\n0.83%\n0.69%\n0.75%\n0.90%\nAllowance for loan losses to:\ntotal loans\n0.78%\n0.78%\n0.81%\n0.80%\n0.85%\nnon-performing assets\n88.48%\n68.44%\n85.30%\n77.22%\n68.59%\nnon-accrual loans\n251.67%\n69.59%\n87.40%\n78.68%\n69.74%\nNON-PERFORMING ASSETS:\n(dollars in thousands)\nLoans delinquent over 90 days\n$ 18\n$ -\n$ 19\n$ -\n$ -\nNon-accrual loans\n1,800\n6,339\n5,086\n5,601\n6,335\nOther real estate owned and repossessed assets\n3,302\n106\n106\n106\n106\nNET LOAN CHARGE-OFFS (RECOVERIES):\n(dollars in thousands)\nLoans charged off\n$ 138\n$ 160\n$ 70\n$ 67\n$ 62\n(Recoveries)\n(52)\n(62)\n(110)\n(286)\n(502)\nNet charge-offs (recoveries)\n86\n98\n(40)\n(219)\n(440)\nPROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES (dollars in thousands)\n$ 205\n$ 134\n$ (2)\n$ (230)\n$ (527)\nALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSS SUMMARY\n(dollars in thousands)\nBalance at the beginning of period\n$ 4,411\n$ 4,375\n$ 4,437\n$ 4,417\n$ 4,505\nProvision\n205\n134\n(2)\n(230)\n(527)\nNet charge-offs (recoveries)\n86\n98\n(40)\n(150)\n(439)\nBalance at the end of period\n$ 4,530\n$ 4,411\n$ 4,375\n$ 4,337\n$ 4,417\n(1)\nThe diluted earnings multiple (or price earnings ratio) is calculated by dividing the period's closing market price per share by total equity per weighted average shares outstanding, diluted for the period.
