    "text": "Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk \nTesla is shuffling its leadership after reportedly missing its first-quarter Model 3 production targets. \nTesla CEO Elon Musk has taken charge of production of the company's flagship electric sedan, pushing aside former Apple executive Doug Field, according to The Information. \nField, Tesla's Senior Vice President of Engineering Field will focus on \"vehicle engineering,\" while Musk focuses on Model 3 production. \n\"Model 3 production is the highest priority at Tesla, so Elon is focusing his time there while Doug focuses on vehicle engineering,\" a Tesla spokesperson said. \nEarlier on Monday, Jalopnik reported that Tesla was making 2,000 Model 3s per week as of the end of the first quarter, according to an internal email from Elon Musk. The company's goal was 2,500 per week. \nField had been consolidating power at Tesla, since leaving Apple to joing the electric automaker in 2013, the Information reported.
