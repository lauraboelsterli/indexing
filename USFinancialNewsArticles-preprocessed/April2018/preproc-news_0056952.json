    "text": "RENO, Nev., April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Monarch Casino & Resort, Inc. (Nasdaq:MCRI) (“Monarch” or “the Company”) today reported operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as summarized below:\n($ in thousands, except per share data and percentages)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Increase Net revenues (1) $ 56,268 $ 53,414 5.3 % Adjusted EBITDA (2) 12,815 12,115 5.8 % Net income $ 6,741 $ 4,872 38.4 % Basic EPS $ 0.38 $ 0.28 35.7 % Diluted EPS $ 0.36 $ 0.27 33.3 %\n(1) As described in the section below entitled “New Revenue Recognition Standard” the Company has changed its revenue recognition policy effective January 1, 2018. This change resulted in a $0.1 million increase in Net revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Please see the reconciliation provided at the end of this release for more information related to the changes in revenues and expenses. (2) Definitions, disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial information are included later in the release. CEO Comment\nJohn Farahi, Co-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Monarch, commented: “Our business is off to a decent start this year with healthy gaming volumes at both Atlantis Casino Resort and Monarch Casino Black Hawk. First quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA rose 5.3% and 5.8%, respectively. Net income and diluted EPS rose 38.4% and 33.3%, respectively, partially benefiting from a lower tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted late last year. Although construction disruption at Black Hawk and labor cost increases at both properties remained a challenge in the first quarter, we continued to manage expenses and optimize margins across the business, while remaining focused on delivering exceptional guest service.\n“We believe Atlantis Casino Resort is well positioned to benefit from the strong current and long-term forecasted economic growth in Reno. Businesses across multiple industries are investing heavily in the region and bringing new jobs and residents to the area. We believe increased housing starts will present another opportunity for Monarch to capitalize on growth in a market where we already achieve an above fair-share of local gaming and entertainment spending.\n“Despite construction disruption, Monarch Casino Black Hawk also had a strong quarter, generating its highest-ever first quarter revenue. Our construction team in Black Hawk is making considerable progress on the expansion project and the tower now is taller than both the garage and our existing facility. Notably, all costs related to the expansion during the quarter were financed from operating cash flow. We continue transforming our property into what we believe will be the market’s premier gaming and entertainment leader, while offering superb and friendly service that drives ongoing guest satisfaction.\n“During the first quarter of 2018, we completed certain modifications to the Monarch Casino Black Hawk construction project scope which we believe will provide additional revenue opportunities for our expanded resort, including enlarging the casino floor and associated amenities by approximately 6,500 square feet. In addition, we have made adjustments to the budget for the rise in construction costs and furniture, fixtures and equipment costs. Accordingly, we have increased our budget for the completion of the Monarch Casino Black Hawk hotel tower and casino expansion to approximately $264 to $269 million. The previously announced budget was approximately $229 to $234 million.\n“Reno and Black Hawk remain among the healthiest of the U.S. regional gaming markets. We are well positioned to benefit from what we believe is a solid foundation for growth and continue to believe our near- and longer-term growth outlook has never been brighter.”\nNew Revenue Recognition Standard\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted accounting standard update No. 2014-09 (“ASC 606”) and all the related amendments to all contracts (“new revenue standard”) which provides consistency in the reported financial information within the gaming industry. The Company applied the modified retrospective method and recognized the cumulative effect of the initial application of the new revenue standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The opening retained earnings adjustment primarily related to the change in the accounting for the slot club liability from the immediate revenue/cost method to the deferred revenue method.\nThe new revenue standard also resulted in reclassifications to and from revenues, promotional allowances and operating expenses. Pursuant to the new FASB guidelines, food and beverage, hotel and other complimentaries are now valued at their retail price and included as revenues within their respective categories, with a corresponding decrease in gaming revenues, as the offsetting amount historically included in promotional allowances has been eliminated. In addition, the cost of providing these complimentary goods and services are now included as expenses within their respective categories, resulting in a corresponding decrease in casino expenses. While those changes have resulted in a $145 thousand increase in net revenue for the quarter, they had no impact on adjusted EBITDA and diluted EPS.\nFinancial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 have not been restated and are reported under the accounting standards in effect during that period. The Company has provided reconciliation between the new revenue standard and the old revenue standard for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 at the end of this release.\nSummary of 2018 First Quarter Operating Results\nFor the 2018 first quarter, consolidated net revenues of $56.3 million increased 5.3% from $53.4 million in the prior year, driven by growth at both Atlantis Casino Resort and Monarch Casino Black Hawk. Primarily due to the change in revenue recognition accounting for which a reconciliation is provided at the end of this release, casino revenues declined 27.5% year over year, hotel revenues increased 12.8% and food and beverage revenues increased 9.3%. Furthermore, as a result of the change in revenue recognition, the Company is no longer reporting consolidated promotional allowances.\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $15.2 million compared to $14.6 million in the prior year period, driven by an increase in labor and utility expense. As a percentage of net revenue, SG&A expenses decreased to 27.0% compared to 27.4% a year ago. Casino operating expense as a percentage of casino revenue decreased to 35.7% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 42.8% in the first quarter of 2017 due to the adoption of the new revenue standard, partially offset by an increase in repair and maintenance expense and an increase in slot machine participation expense. Food and beverage operating expense as a percentage of food and beverage revenue increased to 77.3% during the first quarter of 2018 from 40.4% a year ago as a result of the adoption of the new revenue standard, partially offset by improvements in product cost. Hotel operating expense as a percentage of hotel revenue increased to 55.0% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 39.1% for the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of the adoption of the new revenue standard combined with an increase in small equipment expense.\nThe Company generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $12.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $0.7 million, or 5.8%, over the same period a year ago.\nMonarch Black Hawk Expansion\nSummarized below is an update on the Company’s ongoing upgrade and expansion of Monarch Casino Black Hawk, including the updated budget, expected costs and completion dates for the project as well as the amounts spent through March 31, 2018:\n$ in millions Budget Cost Total Spent Through\nMarch 31, 2018 Left to Spend Estimated\nCompletion Date I.

(2) Includes upgrades to the interior, which were completed in August 2015, demolition of the original garage, and upgrades to the exterior of the existing facility to match the design of the master planned expansion. (3) The Company anticipates funding the hotel tower and casino expansion, as well as the existing facility exterior upgrades, from a combination of operating cash flow and the amended and restated credit facility (the “Amended Credit Facility”). (4) Reflects the increased budget disclosed below. We continue to expect completion of the Monarch Casino Black Hawk hotel tower and casino expansion in the second quarter of 2019.\nCredit Facility and Liquidity\nCapital expenditures in the first quarter of 2018 were funded entirely from the Company’s operating cash flow. Monarch did not make any borrowings on its Amended Credit Facility. As of March 31, 2018, the amount outstanding on the Amended Credit Facility remained at $26.2 million.\nCapital expenditures of $12.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 represent costs related to the Monarch Casino Black Hawk master development plan and ongoing capital maintenance spending.\nInterest expense, net of amount capitalized, for the first quarter of 2018 was $80 thousand, compared to $272 thousand in the first quarter of 2017.\nWe believe that the combination of operating cash flow and the approximately $223.2 million available under the Amended Credit Facility will fund all remaining costs relating to the completion of the Monarch Black Hawk Expansion.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including, but not limited to, statements relating to (i) our plans, objectives, near- and long-term outlook, opportunities, expectations, growth prospects and future operations with respect to Atlantis Casino Resort Spa and Monarch Casino Black Hawk and the markets in their respective regions; (ii) our plans, costs, financing, and additional expenses and revenue opportunities as a result of project and budget modifications, construction, completion and opening timelines of upgraded, redesigned and/or expanded facilities at Monarch Casino Black Hawk; and (iii) our expectations regarding our future position in the market and the quality of service we provide to our guests.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nRECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME\n(In thousands, unaudited)\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net income, a GAAP financial measure:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018 2017 Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ 12,815 $ 12,115 Expenses: Stock based compensation (566 ) (465 ) Depreciation and amortization (3,692 ) (3,906 ) Interest expense, net of amount capitalized (80 ) (272 ) Loss on disposition of assets - (18 ) Provision for income taxes (1,736 ) (2,582 ) Net income $ 6,741 $ 4,872\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, consists of net income plus loss on disposal of assets, provision for income taxes, stock based compensation expense, other one-time charges, interest expense, depreciation and amortization less interest income, any benefit for income taxes and gain on disposal of assets. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income (as determined in accordance with US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles), as an indicator of the Company's operating performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with US GAAP) or as a measure of liquidity. This measure enables comparison of the Company's performance over multiple periods, as well as against the performance of other companies in our industry that report Adjusted EBITDA, although some companies do not calculate this measure in the same manner and, therefore, the measure as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\nSource:Monarch Casino & Resort, Inc.",
