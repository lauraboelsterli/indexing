    "text": "April 15, 2018 / 10:11 PM / Updated 21 minutes ago Goldman Sachs buys personal finance start-up Clarity Money Jessica Resnick-Ault 2 Min Read \nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc bought Clarity Money, a personal finance startup, to bolster its Marcus online lending business, it said Sunday. A Goldman Sachs sign is displayed inside the company's post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 18, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid \nBuying Clarity Money, a free app that helps consumers manage their personal finances, is expected to add over 1 million customers to the financial service firmâ€™s Marcus business. Marcus offers tools to help customers save and borrow. Clarity Money will be re-branded as Marcus by Goldman Sachs over time, the company said. \nTerms were not disclosed. \nGoldman launched Marcus in October 2016 as a way to court Main Street borrowers saddled with credit card debt. It offers loans from $3,500 to $40,000 and targets credit card borrowers who can benefit from consolidating debt into a single loan with a lower interest rate. \nGS Bank, a subsidiary of Goldman Sachs, is making the acquisition. Clarity Money CEO Adam Dell will join Goldman Sachs as a partner. \n(This version of the story corrects in paragraph 4 to say that Marcus offers loans up to $40,000, not $30,000) Reporting By Jessica Resnick-Ault; Editing by Nick Zieminski",
