    "text": "April 18, 2018 / 12:45 PM / Updated 23 minutes ago Italy's 5-Star sets ultimatum to League amid government gridlock Gavin Jones 4 Min Read \nROME (Reuters) - The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement on Wednesday challenged the far-right League to abandon its electoral allies by the end of this week and form a joint government, as talks to end Italy’s post-election deadlock floundered. Italian President Sergio Mattarella speaks with new elected Senate president Maria Elisabetta Alberti Casellati at the Quirinale palace in Rome, Italy, April 18, 2018. Italian Presidential Press Office/Handout via REUTERS \nThe call from 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio came after President Sergio Mattarella asked the head of the upper house Senate to meet bickering party leaders to see if she could break the stalemate following last month’s inconclusive ballot. \nA coalition made up of 5-Star and the League would likely alarm Brussels and financial markets. Both are hostile to EU budget rules and the anti-immigration League also wants to leave the euro zone as soon as it is politically feasible. \n“5-Star is ready to sign a government contract with the League and not with all the center right,” Di Maio told reporters after meeting Senate speaker Maria Casellati. \nDi Maio set a tight deadline for League leader Matteo Salvini to abandon his electoral partner, former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, something Salvini has so far refused to do. \n“I say clearly to Matteo Salvini that there is no time left, he must take a decision this week,” Di Maio said, without specifying what would happen if the ultimatum passed. \nThe euro zone’s third-largest economy has been under a caretaker government since the March 4 election, when 5-Star and the League were the big winners at the expense of mainstream groups. However, no one party or bloc won a clear majority. \nMattarella asked Casellati to report back to him on Friday after exploring the scope for a deal between Berlusconi and Salvini’s conservative alliance, which won most seats at the election, and 5-Star which emerged as the largest single party. \nCasellati, 71, is a senior member of Berlusconi’s Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party and is close to the veteran leader. \n5-Star, which bases its appeal on a promise to clean up politics, refuses to countenance a deal with the 81-year-old media billionaire who has a conviction for tax fraud and is on trial for bribing witnesses - a charge he denies. \nSalvini dispatched his closest aide, Giancarlo Giorgetti, to see Casellati and he showed no sign of bowing to 5-Star’s demands. Instead he called on Di Maio to drop his veto against Berlusconi and to give up his claim to be named prime minister. Related Coverage",
