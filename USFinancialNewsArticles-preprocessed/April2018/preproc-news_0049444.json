    "text": "WARSAW, N.Y., April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Financial Institutions, Inc. (Nasdaq:FISI), today reported financial and operational results for the Financial Institutions, Inc. (the “Company”) is the parent company of Five Star Bank (the “Bank”), Scott Danahy Naylon, LLC (“Scott Danahy Naylon” or “SDN”) and Courier Capital, LLC (“Courier Capital”).\nNet income in the quarter was $9.3 million, 17% higher than $7.9 million in 2017. After preferred dividends, net income available to common shareholders was $8.9 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, compared to $7.6 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, in 2017.\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer Martin K. Birmingham stated, “I am pleased with our first quarter results. We continued to make progress against our fundamental long-term strategic goals, generating loan and deposit growth in-line with our plan while maintaining a strong credit culture. Our wealth management and insurance businesses also performed well in the quarter and we are seeing improved synergies across our community financial services platform.\n“In February, we launched our new brand campaign designed to increase customer knowledge surrounding the services we offer in community banking, wealth management and insurance and to increase awareness of our brand in key urban growth markets. Our campaign tag line ‒ Today is tomorrow in progress ‒ reinforces our goal of providing solutions today that lead to financial well-being in the future. The campaign has been very well-received and early statistics indicate terrific growth in customer awareness and satisfaction.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights:\nDiluted earnings per share of $0.56 was $0.04, or 7.7%, higher than 2017\nNet interest income of $29.6 million was $2.6 million, or 9.8%, higher than 2017\nNoninterest income of $9.0 million was $1.1 million, or 14.7%, higher than 2017\nReturn on average common equity was 9.95%\n-- Return on average tangible common equity was 12.52% (1)\nTotal assets, interest-earning assets, loans and deposits all reached record-high levels at quarter-end:\n-- Total assets increased $47.2 million during the quarter, to $4.15 billion\n-- Total interest-earning assets increased $36.2 million during the quarter, to $3.82 billion\n-- Total loans increased $58.2 million during the quarter, to $2.79 billion\n-- Total deposits increased $169.8 million during the quarter, to $3.38 billion\nThe Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per common share, a 9.1% increase from the most recent dividend. The first quarter dividend represented a 3.29% annualized yield as of March 31, 2018, and a return of ­­43% of first quarter net income to common shareholders\nChief Financial Officer Kevin B. Klotzbach added, “Loan growth was 2.1% in the quarter and relatively balanced across all loan categories with commercial business loans 3.1% higher, residential real estate loans 2.7% higher, consumer indirect loans 2.5% higher and commercial mortgage loans 1.5% higher than at December 31, 2017. Our credit quality remains strong with total non-performing loans to total loans at 0.38% at quarter-end. Our investment securities portfolio decreased by $29.3 million during the quarter as we continued to convert a portion of our marketable securities into loans.”\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income was $29.6 million in 2018, $132 thousand lower than the fourth quarter of 2017 and $2.6 million higher than 2017.\nAverage interest-earning assets for the quarter were $3.80 billion, $59.8 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2017 and $320.7 million higher than 2017. The primary driver of the increase was organic loan growth. Net interest margin for 2018 was 3.19%, six basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2017 and four basis points lower than 2017. The tax-equivalent yield on municipal securities was lower in the quarter because of the reduction in federal income tax rate to 21% in 2018 from 35% in 2017, negatively impacting net interest margin compared to the prior year. Fourth quarter of 2017 net interest margin was positively impacted by approximately $300 thousand of fee income comprised of yield maintenance fees relating to prepayment of mortgage-backed securities and payment deferral program fees. First quarter of 2017 net interest margin benefitted from approximately $100 thousand of yield maintenance fees relating to prepayment of mortgage-backed securities. No such fees were recognized in 2018.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income was $9.0 million in 2018, relatively unchanged as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and $1.1 million higher than 2017.\nExcluding the net gain on investment securities from all periods, noninterest income was $9.0 million in 2018, $657 thousand higher than $8.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and $1.4 million higher than $7.6 million in 2017.\nThe Company has made investments in limited partnerships, primarily small business investment companies, and accounts for these investments under the equity method. Income from investments in limited partnerships was $568 thousand in 2018 as compared to $19 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a loss of $30 thousand in 2017. Income from these investments fluctuates based on the maturity and performance of the underlying investments.\nInvestment advisory income was $1.8 million in 2018, $31 thousand higher than the fourth quarter of 2017 and $347 thousand higher than 2017. The increase over the prior year period was primarily driven by the third quarter of 2017 acquisition of the assets of a Buffalo-area wealth management firm.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense was $24.1 million in 2018 as compared to $23.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $20.9 million in 2017.\nSalaries and employee benefits expense of $13.4 million was $457 thousand higher than the fourth quarter of 2017 and $2.1 million higher than 2017 as a result of our organic growth initiatives and approximately $1.0 million of non-recurring expenses in 2018 related to senior management retirements at our insurance subsidiary, higher contingent incentive compensation related to our wealth management subsidiary as a result of expected earnout payment, and the payment of one-time awards to employees not covered by certain incentive programs.\nOccupancy and equipment expense of $4.4 million was $349 thousand higher than the fourth quarter of 2017 and $443 thousand higher than 2017. The increase from the fourth quarter of 2017 was largely due to higher snow removal expense. The increase as compared to 2017 was primarily the result of the relocation of the Five Star Bank Rochester regional administration center in 2017 and the impact of a branch opening in February 2017.\nAdvertising and promotions expense of $977 thousand was $257 thousand higher than the fourth quarter of 2017 and $515 thousand higher than 2017 as a result of the new Five Star Bank brand campaign launched in February 2018. Advertising and promotions expense in 2017 was lower than historical experience in anticipation of the new campaign.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense was $2.3 million in 2018 as compared to $580 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $3.2 million in 2017.\nThe effective tax rate was 19.6% in 2018 as compared to 28.5% in 2017, reflecting lower federal corporate tax rates because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJ Act”).\nThe effective tax rate of 5.0% in the fourth quarter of 2017 was the result of a $2.9 million reduction in income tax expense due to the TCJ Act, primarily driven by a revaluation adjustment to the net deferred tax liability.\nBalance Sheet and Capital Management\nTotal assets were $4.15 billion at March 31, 2018, up $47.2 million from $4.11 billion at December 31, 2017, and up $292.6 million from $3.86 billion at March 31, 2017. The increases were largely the result of loan growth funded by deposit growth and net proceeds from a 2017 common equity offering. Between May and November of 2017, the Company sold 1.4 million shares of common stock through an at-the-market offering (“2017 Equity Offering”) generating approximately $40.0 million of gross proceeds and $38.3 million of net proceeds.\nTotal loans were $2.79 billion at March 31, 2018, up $58.2 million, or 2.1%, from December 31, 2017, and up $390.6 million, or 16.3%, from March 31, 2017.\nCommercial business loans totaled $464.1 million, up $13.8 million, or 3.1%, from December 31, 2017, and up $88.6 million, or 23.6%, from March 31, 2017.\nCommercial mortgage loans totaled $821.1 million, up $12.2 million, or 1.5%, from December 31, 2017, and up $146.1 million, or 21.6%, from March 31, 2017.\nResidential real estate loans totaled $477.9 million, up $12.7 million, or 2.7%, from December 31, 2017, and up $49.8 million, or 11.6%, from March 31, 2017.\nConsumer indirect loans totaled $898.1 million, up $21.5 million, or 2.5%, from December 31, 2017, and up $112.0 million, or 14.2%, from March 31, 2017.\nTotal deposits were $3.38 billion at March 31, 2018, an increase of $169.8 million from December 31, 2017, and an increase of $210.4 million from March 31, 2017. The increase from December 31, 2017, was primarily due to public deposit seasonality. The increase from March 31, 2017, was primarily the result of successful business development efforts in both municipal and retail banking. Public deposit balances represented 29% of total deposits at March 31, 2018, compared to 26% at December 31, 2017 and 31% at March 31, 2017.\nShareholders’ equity was $380.3 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $381.2 million at December 31, 2017, and $325.7 million at March 31, 2017. Common book value per share was $22.83 at March 31, 2018, $22.85 at December 31, 2017, and $21.21 at March 31, 2017. Changes in shareholders’ equity and common book value per share are attributable to net income less dividends paid plus proceeds from the 2017 Equity Offering, net of the change in unrealized gain (loss) on investment securities.\nDuring 2018, the Company declared a common stock dividend of $0.24 per common share, a 9.1% increase from the most recent dividend. The dividend returned 43% of first quarter net income to common shareholders.\nRegulatory capital ratios at March 31, 2018, were slightly lower than December 31, 2017 ratios, primarily as a result of loan growth and higher asset levels. March 31, 2018 ratios were higher than March 31, 2017 ratios as a result of the 2017 Equity Offering:\nLeverage Ratio was 8.11%, compared to 8.13% and 7.30% at December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2017, respectively.\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 10.09%, compared to 10.16% and 9.46% at December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2017, respectively.\nTier 1 Capital Ratio was 10.65%, compared to 10.74% and 10.11% at December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2017, respectively.\nTotal Risk-Based Capital Ratio was 13.09%, compared to 13.19% and 12.75% at December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2017, respectively.\nCredit Quality\nNon-performing loans were $10.7 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $12.5 million at December 31, 2017, and $8.0 million at March 31, 2017. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 0.38% at March 31, 2018; 0.46% at December 31, 2017; and 0.33% at March 31, 2017.\nProvision for loan losses was $2.9 million for the first quarter, a decrease of $1.0 million from the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase of $168 thousand from 2017.\nNet charge-offs were $2.0 million during the quarter, $1.6 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2017 and $607 thousand lower than 2017. The ratio of annualized net charge-offs to total average loans was 0.30% in the quarter; 0.54% in the fourth quarter of 2017; and 0.45% in 2017.\nThe ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans was 1.27% at March 31, 2018, 1.27% at December 31, 2017, and 1.29% at March 31, 2017.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host an earnings conference call and audio webcast on April 27, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
