Soccer Football - Premier League - Crystal Palace vs Brighton & Hove Albion - Selhurst Park, London, Britain - April 14, 2018 Crystal Palace fans celebrate after the match REUTERS/Dylan Martinez \nWhile the Hornets are in a relatively comfortable 12th place, they are only three points above Palace and are smarting from a stoppage-time defeat at Huddersfield last week. \nJavier Gracia’s team have not won since a March 3 victory over bottom club West Brom and history is against them when facing the Eagles. \nWatford are winless in their last six home meetings with Crystal Palace in all competitions, losing three of those games, and they have not beaten the London side since a 2-0 victory in the second-tier Championship in 2009. \nAll of which makes this a winnable game for Roy Hodgson’s Palace whose in-form winger Wilfried Zaha will pose serious questions for the Watford defence. \nPalace have a relatively easy run-in with a trips to Leicester City and Stoke City before a final day home fixture with bottom club West Bromwich Albion. \nWest Brom, who upset Manchester United at Old Trafford last week, have another tough test when they face Liverpool on Saturday. \nThe Reds are unbeaten in their last nine Premier League meetings with West Brom although they were held to a goalless draw at Anfield this season. \nLiverpool striker Mohamed Salah is only one goal away from equalling the record for the most goals scored in a 38-match season, jointly held by Alan Shearer, Cristiano Ronaldo and Luis Suarez with 31. \nSunday sees a London derby with West Ham United, who have fought their way out of the relegation zone, facing an Arsenal team that may have their focus on next week’s Europa League semi-final, first leg with Atletico Madrid. \nChampions Manchester City host Swansea City having secured the title last week while seventh-placed Burnley hope to continue their push towards Europa League qualification at struggling Stoke City.
