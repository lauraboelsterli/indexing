    "text": "April 4, 2018 / 11:59 AM / Updated 26 minutes ago Investigators to probe if negligence led to Moscow mall fire   \nMOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian investigators said on Wednesday they have opened a criminal case into a fire at a shopping mall in eastern Moscow that killed one person earlier in the day. An emergency service worker removes debris at the fire-damaged shopping mall in the Siberian city of Kemerovo, Russia March 27, 2018. REUTERS/Maksim Lisov \nThe investigating committee said it would look into whether the fire at the four-storey ‘Perseus for Children’ shopping mall, which sells children’s goods, had been caused by negligence. \nIn March, a total of 64 people, mostly children, were killed in a fire at a Siberian shopping mall.
