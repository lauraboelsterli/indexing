    "text": "April 26, 2018 / 10:13 PM / Updated 16 minutes ago BOJ set to keep policy steady, maintain price forecasts Leika Kihara 4 Min Read\nTOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s central bank is set to keep monetary policy steady on Friday and project inflation to hit its target next fiscal year, signaling that its next move could be to dial back its huge stimulus albeit at a much slower pace than its global peers. FILE PHOTO - People walk on a street in front of the Bank of Japan headquarters in Tokyo, Japan, March 31, 2016. REUTERS/Yuya Shino/File Photo\nTwo new deputy governors - career central banker Masayoshi Amamiya and former academic Masazumi Wakatabe who is known as a vocal advocate of aggressive easing - make their debut at the two-day rate review ending on Friday.\nWhile many analysts do not expect the newcomers to rock the boat at their debut rate review, some say Wakatabe could widen a rift in the board between advocates of big easing and those wary of the rising cost of prolonged easing.\nThe meeting also marks the fifth anniversary since Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, who was reappointed for another five-year term, deployed a massive asset-buying program to break Japan out of deflation and accelerate inflation to his 2 percent goal.\nWhile the board agrees on the need to keep policy easy for now, some have openly complained about the demerits of prolonged low rates in a sign of the challenge Kuroda faces in eradicating Japan’s sticky deflationary mindset with a diminishing tool-kit.\nWith no policy change expected on Friday, markets are on the look-out for what Kuroda says on the effect rising U.S. Treasury yields could have on the Bank of Japan’s policy capping Japanese long-term rates around zero percent.\n“The BOJ is controlling Japanese yields well and I don’t think that would change as a result of U.S. yield gains,” said Mari Iwashita, chief market economist at Daiwa Securities.\n“If U.S. rates continue to rise, that might put upward pressure on Japanese yields. But for the BOJ, that’s far less trouble than a yen spike that puts it under pressure to ease further,” she said.\nThe BOJ is widely expected to maintain a pledge to guide short-term interest rates at minus 0.1 percent and the 10-year bond yield around zero percent.\nIn a quarterly review of its projections, the BOJ is likely to keep unchanged the timeframe for hitting its price goal, now set at fiscal 2019, sources have told Reuters.\nThe nine-member board is also seen roughly maintaining its forecast made in January that inflation will hit 1.8 percent in fiscal 2019, and project inflation to stay near 2 percent the following year, they say.\nSuch optimistic estimates would reflect the BOJ’s view that robust global demand will keep the economy on course for a solid recovery, allowing companies to boost spending and raise wages.\nThe BOJ’s huge bond purchases have kept Japanese bond yields stable, even as benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields climbed above 3 percent for the first time in four years.\nThat has caused U.S.-Japan yield differentials to widen in the dollar’s favor, leaving the yen lower in a welcome boost to Japan’s export-reliant economy.\nJapanese policymakers generally favor a weak yen as it gives the country’s exports a competitive advantage overseas. It also pushes up import costs and works to accelerate inflation.\nJapan’s economy expanded an annualized 1.6 percent in the October-December quarter, marking the eighth straight quarter of gains, on robust global demand and capital spending.\nBut core consumer inflation stood at 0.9 percent in March, well below the BOJ’s target, as slow wage growth keeps consumers from increasing their spending.
