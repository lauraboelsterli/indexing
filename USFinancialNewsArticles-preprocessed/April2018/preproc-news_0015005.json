    "text": "EditorsNote: updates with playoff status\nAnaheim centers Rickard Rakell, Adam Henrique and Hampus Lindholm scored and goaltender Ryan Miller posted his fourth shutout of the season as the Ducks clinched home-ice advantage in the first round of the playoffs with a 3-0 victory over the Coyotes at Gila River Arena on Saturday.\nRakell has a career-high 34 goals, Henrique has 24 and the Ducks (44-25-13) will be the No. 2 seed in the Pacific Division. They will face the San Jose Sharks (45-27-10) in Round 1.\nThe Ducks are 10-1-1 in their last 12 games and 17-5-2 in their last 24. They vaulted over the Los Angeles Kings into third place in the division by beating Dallas on Friday. They won three of four against the Coyotes this season.\nMiller made 31 saves and was helped by a defense that stopped all four power-play opportunities by Arizona (29-41-12). He has won his last four starts. Miller entered the game with a 1.60 goals-against average and a .947 save percentage in 15 games against the Coyotes, the best numbers against any team he has faced more than once.\nPhoenix, which lost 10 of its first 11 under first-year coach Rick Tocchet, played much better in the second half, going 20-14-7 after the midway point.\nArizona goaltender Antti Raanta made 24 saves in his first game since agreeing to a three-year, $12.75 million contract extension. Raanta, who battled injuries early, was 21-17-6 in his first season as a starting goalie.\nHenrique poked in a rebound to score on a power play at 10:54 of the first period, the only goal of the period. Rakell and Corey Perry had assists. Henrique has 24 goals, 20 in 57 games with the Ducks since joining them in late December.\nRakell took a centering pass from behind the net from Ryan Getzlaf to make it 2-0 at 16:17 of the second period. Rakell had 33 goals last season.\nLindholm scored on an empty-net goal with four seconds remaining.\nâ€”Field Level Media\n ",
