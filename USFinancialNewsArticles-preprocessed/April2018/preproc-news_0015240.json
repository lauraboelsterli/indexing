TIGER FAILS TO MOUNT CHARGE \nTiger Woods failed to take advantage of favourable scoring conditions at a wet Augusta National, offsetting three bogeys with three birdies for an even-par 72 that left him at four over on the week and 13 shots back of overnight leader Patrick Reed. \nMICKELSON HAS ROLLER-COASTER DAY \nThree-times winner Phil Mickelson had a roller-coaster round that included an opening triple-bogey and an eagle at the par-five 8th hole en route to a two-over par 74 that left him at seven over on the week. RAIN GREETS EARLY STARTERS AT AUGUSTA NATIONAL \nThunderstorms are in the forecast and could interrupt third-round action at Augusta National where a steady dose of rain greeted the early starters.
