    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson welcomed Russia’s defeat on Wednesday in its attempt to get the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to back a joint investigation into the poisoning of a former Russian double agent in Britain.\nBritain's Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson speaks during a banquet with diplomats at Mansion House in London, Britain March 28, 2018. REUTERS/Simon Dawson “Russia has had one goal in mind since the attempted murders on UK soil through the use of a military-grade chemical weapon — to obscure the truth and confuse the public,” Johnson said in a statement.\n“The international community has yet again seen through these tactics and robustly defeated Russia’s attempts today to derail the proper international process.”\nWriting by William Schomberg; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ",
