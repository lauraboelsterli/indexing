    "text": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla., April 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nRecent Corporate and Clinical Developments:\nPublished long-term immune response and progression-free survival data from completed Phase 1 clinical study of TPIV200 Commenced dosing in 280-patient, grant-funded Phase 2 study of TPIV200 in women with advanced TNBC Enhanced IP portfolio for PolyStart™ technology, expanding to cover any polypeptide sequences comprising poly-antigen arrays (PAAs) Appointed Dr. Richard Kenney as Acting Chief Medical Officer\nUpcoming Anticipated Milestones:\nQ3 2018: Report interim immune response data from ongoing Phase 2 TNBC 2H 2018: Report interim results from ongoing Phase 2 study of TPIV200 in combination with AstraZeneca's durvalumab in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer 2018: Mayo Clinic to initiate Phase 1b/2a study of TPIV100 in women with HER2/neu+ ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) breast cancer 1Q 2019: Report interim safety and futility results from Phase 2 ovarian cancer study\nTapImmune Inc. (NASDAQ: TPIV), a leading clinical-stage immuno-oncology company with ongoing clinical trials in ovarian and breast cancer, today provided its business update for the fourth quarter and year-end 2017. A public conference call and live audio webcast is scheduled for today at 4:30 p.m. ET.\n\"Throughout 2017, we made significant advances toward achieving our goals and reaching our milestones,\" said Peter Hoang, President and CEO of TapImmune. \"We recently announced the publication of new clinical data for our multi-epitope T-cell vaccine targeting folate receptor alpha, TPIV200, in patients with ovarian and breast cancer. In this publication we showed an encouraging potential progression-free survival benefit in women with ovarian cancer in their first remission, which we are currently exploring further in an ongoing randomized Phase 2 study. Should we see a similar, prolonged PFS in this larger study, we believe that TPIV200 could have a viable pathway toward potential approval in this indication, for which it has FDA Fast Track designation. We remain on track to conduct an interim safety and futility analysis for the Phase 2 study by mid-2019.\"\nMr. Hoang continued, \"With multiple Phase 2 and Phase 1/2 clinical studies ongoing, several of which are funded by U.S. Department of Defense grants, and our preclinical PolyStart™ technology maturing rapidly to the point where it may drive value through strategic partnership, we believe TapImmune is on a strong growth trajectory that will continue through 2018 and beyond. Our progress will be measured by continued milestone execution and we look forward to building value at each step along the way.\"\nCurrent Clinical Studies:\nTPIV200: Lead T-cell vaccine targeting folate receptor alpha\nFDA Fast-tracked Phase 2 maintenance therapy study in platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer\nTapImmune is currently enrolling women who have completed initial therapy with a platinum regimen and are in first remission. Enrollment remains on track with projections and the company plans to conduct a blinded interim safety and futility analysis once the data from the first half of enrollment is achieved and responses mature, which is currently expected by mid-2019. This program benefits from FDA Fast Track and Orphan Drug designation. Multi-center Phase 2 dosing study in triple-negative breast cancer\nThe randomized study is designed to determine the optimal vaccine dose and regimen that may maximize the anti-tumor immune response in maintenance-phase patients who have completed standard surgery and chemotherapy/radiation. Enrollment in this study is complete and TapImmune expects to report interim immune response data in the third quarter 2018. U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)-funded Phase 2 efficacy study in advanced triple-negative breast cancer\nIn late 2017, the Mayo Clinic successfully dosed the first patient in a Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TPIV200 in prolonging disease-free survival in women with advanced triple-negative breast cancer. This 280-patient randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled study is completely funded by a $13.3 million grant from the U.S. DoD. Memorial Sloan Kettering-sponsored Phase 2 combination study with AstraZeneca's durvalumab in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer\nData from the first 27 patients enrolled in the study are currently being analyzed by the study's clinical investigators at MSKCC. TapImmune anticipates reporting the results based on these 27 patients once patient analysis at MSKCC is released.\nPlanned Clinical Studies:\nTPIV100/110 T-cell vaccine targeting HER2/neu:\nMayo Clinic is expected to initiate a Phase 1b/2a study of TPIV100 in women with an early form of breast cancer called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). This study is also fully funded by a grant from the U.S. DoD. If successful, TapImmune's HER2/neu-targeted vaccine may complement standard surgery and chemotherapy. TapImmune planned to submit FDA filings for its five-peptide HER2 vaccine, TPIV110, and begin a Phase 1/2 clinical study in women with HER2-low breast cancer. In the fourth quarter, the U.S. DoD expressed interest in fully funding a larger Phase 2 clinical study using TPIV110 in combination with Herceptin® (trastuzumab) in HER2neu+ breast cancer. TapImmune is currently engaged in discussions with the Mayo Clinic and the U.S. DoD regarding this Phase 2 study, which would supplant the previously planned TapImmune-sponsored Phase 1/2 study. TapImmune will provide an update once the details of the study and the required FDA filings are finalized.\nConference Call and Webcast Information :\nTo access the live conference call on April 5, 2018, at 4:30pm ET you may use:\n(855) 238-2333 (U.S.) (412) 317-5215 (International)\nTo access the live audio webcast, visit the Events section of the TapImmune website http://tapimmune.com/events .

The company's peptide or nucleic acid-based immunotherapeutic products comprise multiple naturally processed epitopes (NPEs) that are designed to comprehensively stimulate a patient's killer T-cells and helper T-cells, and to restore or further augment antigen presentation using proprietary nucleic acid-based expression systems. This unique approach can produce off-the-shelf T-cell vaccine candidates that elicit a broad-based T-cell response and can be used without respect to HLA type. The company's technologies may be used as stand-alone medications or in combination with other treatment modalities.\nFor additional information visit: https://tapimmune.com/\nTo receive future press releases via email, please visit:\nhttps://tapimmune.com/investors/email-alerts/\nFollow us on Twitter @Tapimmune_Inc , or follow us on Facebook .\nFor answers to frequently asked questions, please visit our FAQs page: https://tapimmune.com/investors/frequently-asked-questions/\nForward-Looking Statement Disclaimer\nThis release contains forward-looking information within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
