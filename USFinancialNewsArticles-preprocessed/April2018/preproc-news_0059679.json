    "text": "MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish telecoms firm Telefonica on Thursday posted a 3.9 percent fall in first quarter core profit from a year earlier, in line with analyst expectations, as improvements in the domestic market were offset by currency pressures.\nA man stands under a logo of Spain's telecom giant Telefonica at the company's headquarters in Madrid, Spain, February 26, 2016. REUTERS/Juan Medina/File Photo Telefonica has been raising tariffs in its home market after investing billions in high-speed networks in an effort to combat low-cost rivals such as Spain’s Mas Movil.\nThe group expects revenues to rise around 1 percent and Oibda margin to increase by half a percentage point as a result. It would keep its dividend unchanged at 0.40 euros per share.\nOperating income before depreciation and amortisation (Oibda) was 3.86 billion euros ($4.70 billion) compared with analysts’ forecast of 3.86 billion euros.\nTelefonica - which also offers services in Britain, Germany and throughout Latin America - had revenues of 12.19 billion euros in the first quarter compared to 13.13 billion euros a year earlier while net profit was 837 million euros compared to 779 million euros.\n($1 = 0.8214 euros)\nReporting by Julien Toyer; Editing by Paul Day and Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ",
