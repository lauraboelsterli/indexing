FILE PHOTO: A Grab employee uses the Apps to book a cab for passengers at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) in the metro Manila, Philippines, July 22, 2016. REUTERS/Romeo Ranoco \nThe Philippine Competition Commission said in a statement it has reason to believe that the deal “may likely substantially lessen, prevent, or restrict competition”. The PCC’s jurisdiction and review procedures are limited to the Philippines. \nThe Philippines and Malaysia had said on Monday they will look into whether the deal hinders competition, days after Singapore began a probe into the deal on similar concerns.
