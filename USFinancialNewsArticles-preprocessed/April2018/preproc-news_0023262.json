The excess of total consideration over the carrying value of the disposed entities was $342.0 million. The Company recognized $161.5 million of gain in the fourth quarter and booked $180.4 million as deferred gain from the disposal of discontinued operations to be recognized when the receivables from purchasers are collected in future periods. Shifted the corporate focus to becoming a leading smart car and smart ride company by leveraging Link Motion's CarBrain platform. This rebranding from NQ Mobile Inc. to Link Motion Inc. and the ticker symbol for the Company's ADS traded on the NYSE from \"NQ\" to \"LKM\". Formed a partnership with Hangzhou First Technology Co., a leading car design and engineering firm, to design Link Motion's passenger-centric smart car for its future Smart Ride business. Extended Link Motion's product offerings beyond passenger cars to public transportation vehicles and was selected as the platform vendor for pure electric buses being demonstrated in the city of Qingdao. Formed a partnership with Chery Automotive Co., to jointly develop a technology platform for the connected vehicle of the future including fully autonomous vehicles. Established a partnership with Irdeto, one of the world leaders in digital platform security, to integrate its secure vehicle access solution into our CarBrain platform for new lines of connected and autonomous cars.\nManagement Commentary\n\"2017 was a transformational year for Link Motion, as we prepared the company to capitalize on the massive smart car opportunity we believe is in the early stages of its growth cycle,\" said Dr. Vincent Shi, Founder and Chairman of Link Motion. \"Our Company, NQ Mobile was founded for the smart phone revolution and today Link Motion is built for the upcoming smart car \"revolution.\"\n\"Over the last several months, we have made great strides in the development of our future businesses and have put in place the skilled talent needed to execute upon our operational plans. As we move forward into 2018, we expect to continue to form key partnerships with major industry players and have identified three key operational milestones we expect to achieve in 2018 including the commercial rollout of our Smart Ride business in the summer, the further growth of our CarBrain platform, and the resulting revenue growth from these new businesses.\"\n\"Our entire management team is confident in our ability to ramp our smart car and smart ride businesses in the quarters to come. We are focused on delivering the key milestones for 2018.\"\n\"To further support the transparency amongst our shareholder base and new institutional investors, Link Motion will be hosting investor and analyst events in China expected in the Summer of 2018 after our launch city is announced. As part of our new strategic investor relations and communication program, we plan to be aggressive with our progress updates and adhering to best practices in the United States and abroad. We also expect to be attending multiple investor conferences throughout 2018 in key global markets.\" Concluded Dr. Shi.\nFinancial Results\nThe Company announced in a press release on December 14, 2017 (the \"disposal date\") that it had completed the divestment of FL Mobile and sale of Showself's Live Social Video Business (the \"Divestments\"). Accordingly, the financial results were deconsolidated as of December 14, 2017. The key financial information related to the Divestments for the period up to the disposal date, is quantified in the discontinued sections below. All results presented for the current period reflect these changes and the comparable periods presented have also been adjusted retrospectively.\nAdditionally, the excess of total consideration over the carrying value of the disposed entities was $342.0 million. The Company has recognized $161.5 million of gain in the fourth quarter, which represents the percentage of the cash received of the overall consideration. The remaining portion of the excess which represents the percentage of the consideration that is still receivable, is $180.4 million and recorded as deferred gain from the disposal of discontinued operations on the balance sheet. The Company will recognize these gains pro-rata as it receives cash from the purchasers in future periods.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nRevenues\nNet revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased 23.1% year-over-year to $13.4 million from $17.5 million in the same period in 2016.\nConsumer Services revenues consist of advertising and other consumer services. Advertising revenues increased 14.2% year-over-year to $3.2 million from $2.8 million in the same period in 2016. The increase in advertising revenues was mainly due to overseas promotional business. Other services revenues decreased 17.6% year-over-year to $0.9 million from $1.1 million in the same period a year ago. The decrease in other service revenues was mainly due to lower premium consumer security revenues as a result of the Company moving away from premium subscription services to an advertising-based model.\nEnterprise Mobility revenues decreased 31.2% year-over-year to $9.4 million from $13.6 million in the same period in 2016. The decrease in enterprise product revenues was mainly due to weakness in customer demand in the fourth quarter of the year compared to the same period of last year.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased 45.3% year-over-year to $11.4 million from $20.8 million in the same period in 2016. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to lower hardware sales within the enterprise business and lower customer acquisition cost within the consumer services segment.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $2.0 million from a gross loss of $3.4 million in the same period in 2016. Gross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of net revenues, was 15.2% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with negative gross margin of 19.2% in the same period in 2016.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased 41.5% year-over-year to $1.2 million from $2.1 million in the same period in 2016. Non-GAAP selling and marketing expenses, which exclude share-based compensation decreased 42.9% year-over-year to $1.2 million from $2.1 million in the same period in 2016. The year-over-year decrease is primarily driven by a reduction in overall staff costs and lower overall marketing and advertising expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 135.5% year-over-year to $28.8 million from $12.2 million in the same period in 2016. Non-GAAP general and administrative expenses, which exclude share-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets arising from acquisitions, increased 153.5% year-over-year to $28.7 million from $11.3 million in the same period in 2016. The year-over-year increase is primarily driven by a non-cash accounting treatment of allowance for bad debt in the quarter.\nResearch and development expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 98.2% year-over-year to $7.9 million from $4.0 million in the same period in 2016. Non-GAAP research and development expenses, which exclude share-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets arising from acquisitions, increased 93.8% to $7.8 million from $4.0 million in the same period in 2016. The increase is mainly due to the Link Motion business and development projects.\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $4.9 million as the result of a one-time, non-cash impairment of goodwill in the enterprise reporting unit.\nTotal operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased 63.5% year-over-year to $42.8 million from $117.2 million in the same period in 2016. The decrease was mainly the result of less impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in the period, offset by increases in general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude share-based compensation, the amortization of intangible assets arising from acquisitions, and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 116.1% year-over-year to $37.7 million from $17.4 million in the same period in 2016. The increase is mainly due to the increase in general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses as described above. See below under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for a discussion of Non-GAAP operating expenses and a reconciliation of such measure to the most comparable measure calculated under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\").\nShare-based Compensation Expenses\nShare-based compensation expenses, which were allocated to related operating cost and expenses line items, amounted to $0.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $0.1million in the corresponding period in 2016.\nLoss from Operations\nLoss from operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $40.8 million, compared with $120.5 million in the same period in 2016.\nNon-GAAP loss from operations, which excludes share-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets arising from acquisitions, and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, was $35.6 million compared to $19.8 million in the same period in 2016. See below under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for a discussion of Non-GAAP loss from operations and a reconciliation of such measure to the most comparable measure calculated under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\").\nForeign Exchange Gain/(Loss) , Interest Expenses and Other Income\nForeign exchange gain was $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with a loss of $0.6 million in the same period in 2016, which was affected by fluctuations in the foreign exchange rates. Interest expenses were $4.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $6.1 million in the same period a year ago. Interest expenses were primarily derived from interest expense related to convertible debts, offset by the interest income from certain term deposits. The decrease of interest expenses is mainly due to we early redeemed $ 88 million convertible debt.\nImpairment Loss\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized impairment losses of $1.4 million, primarily driven by one-time non-cash write-downs of long-term investments.\nIncome Tax\nIncome tax expense was $0.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with income tax benefit of $3.1 million in the same period in 2016.\nDiscontinued Operations\nThe Company announced in a press release on December 14, 2017 that it had completed the divestment of FL Mobile and Showself's Live Social Video Business. Accordingly, the financial statements of FL Mobile and Showself were deconsolidated as of the disposal date.

The Company will recognize these gains pro-rata as it receives cash from the purchasers in future periods.\nNet Income/Loss\nNet Income attributable to Link Motion was $111.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with net loss of $111.2 million in the same period in 2016.

See below under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for a discussion of Non-GAAP net income and a reconciliation of such measure to the most comparable measure calculated under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\").\nCash and Cash Equivalents, Term Deposits and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents, term deposits and restricted cash together amounted to $319.8 million as of December 31, 2017.\nCash Flow\nNet cash flow used in operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $13.7 million.\nFiscal Year 2017 Financial Results\nRevenues\nNet revenues for the fiscal year 2017 decreased 5.0% year-over-year to $57.6 million from $60.6 million in 2016.\nConsumer Services revenues consist of advertising and other consumer services. Advertising revenues decreased 33.1% year-over-year to $10.4 million from $15.6 million in the same period in 2016. The decrease in advertising revenues was mainly due to lower overall activity within many of the traffic-related businesses as the Company prepares to optimize its operations and change focus to the smart car and smart ride businesses in the future. Other services revenues decreased 32.4% year-over-year to $4.0 million from $5.9 million in the same period a year ago. The decrease in other services revenues was mainly due to lower premium consumer security revenues as a result of the Company moving away from premium subscription services to an advertising-based model.\nEnterprise Mobility revenues increased 10.3% year-over-year to $43.2 million from $39.2 million in the same period in 2016. The increase in enterprise mobility revenues was mainly due to stronger overall hardware sales of Trustek in the year.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues for the fiscal year 2017 decreased 12.1% year-over-year to $56.6 million from $64.4 million in the same period in 2016.

Gross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of net revenues, was 1.8% for the fiscal year 2017, compared with a negative gross margin of 6.1% in 2016.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling and marketing expenses for the fiscal year 2017 decreased 37.4% year-over-year to $4.8 million from $7.6 million in 2016.

Non-GAAP research and development expenses for the fiscal year 2017, which exclude share-based compensation and the amortization of intangible assets arising from acquisitions, increased 37.2% to $17.1 million from $12.4 million in 2016.

The Company also uses non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per ADS, which is the non-GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders divided by weighted average number of diluted ADS.\nThe Company's non-GAAP financial information is provided as additional information to help the Company's investors compare business trends among different reporting periods on a consistent basis and to enhance investors' overall understanding of the historical and current financial performance of the Company's continuing operations and its prospects for the future. The Company's non-GAAP financial information should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. In addition, the Company's calculation of this non-GAAP financial information may be different from the calculation used by other companies, and therefore comparability may be limited.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of Link Motion's current financial performance and prospects for the future. A limitation of using non-GAAP cost of revenues, operating expenses, income from operations and net income attributable to Link Motion, excluding share-based compensation expenses, interest expenses related to convertible debts and fair value change of derivative liability related to the convertible debts and loss of early redemption of the convertible debts, amortization of intangible assets arising from acquisitions, impairment losses from goodwill, intangible assets and investments, and income tax provision related to the amortization of intangible assets arising from acquisitions and impairment loss from goodwill, intangible assets and investment are that these items has been and may continue to be a significant expense in the Company's business for the foreseeable future. In order to mitigate these limitations, the Company has provided specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure. The accompanying tables include details on the reconciliation between GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to the non-GAAP financial measures the Company has presented.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis news release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined in the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
