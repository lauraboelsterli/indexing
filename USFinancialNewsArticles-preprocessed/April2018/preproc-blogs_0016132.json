    "text": "Published: Apr 5, 2018 8:43 a.m. ET Share \nLuiz Inácio Lula da Silva had sought to remain free while he appeals corruption conviction Getty Images After the court’s ruling, it is now up to Judge Sérgio Moro, who convicted Lula, shown here, last year as part of the country’s massive Car Wash corruption investigation, to issue a warrant for his arrest—a mere technicality, criminal lawyers said. \nBy Samantha Pearson Paulo Trevisani \nBrazil’s Supreme Court rejected former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s efforts to avoid jail in a watershed ruling early Thursday that is expected to land the populist leader behind bars within days and end his bid for re-election. \nIn a case that has divided this nation and put the country’s three-decade-old democracy to the test, the court’s justices voted 6-5 against the leftist icon, denying his request to remain out of prison while he exhausts all possible appeals against his conviction for corruption. \nRead: Ex-president’s fate holds key to the direction of Brazil’s currency \nThe 72-year-old was found guilty last year of accepting a penthouse apartment from a construction firm in exchange for favors, landing him a 12-year prison sentence and marking a dramatic fall from grace for the former shoeshine boy who left office seven years ago as one of the world’s most popular politicians. \nDon’t miss: How tariffs aimed at China could ripple through emerging-market currencies \nThursday’s ruling all but ends Lula’s hopes of running in October’s presidential election, a vote polls show he would win. The outcome also propels other potential candidates to the front of the pack, including a right-wing former army captain, Jair Bolsonaro, and the environmentalist Marina Silva. ",
