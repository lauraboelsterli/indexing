    "text": "March 31, 2018 / 9:20 PM / Updated 19 hours ago Britain must keep step with Russia's evolving capabilities - minister Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nEDINBURGH (Reuters) - Britain’s defence capabilities must evolve to keep step with the growing threat posed by Russia, Defence Minister Gavin Williamson said, as a standoff between Moscow and the West over the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter deepened. British Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson visits UK troops of the NATO Enhanced Forward Presence battle group at the military base in Tapa, Estonia March 25, 2018. REUTERS/Janis Laizans \n“(Russian President Vladimir) Putin is using growing hybrid capabilities to subvert, undermine, and influence countries around the world,” Williamson said in a column in Sunday’s edition of Britain’s Sunday Telegraph. \n“It’s vital for UK defence to keep evolving to meet the threats of tomorrow to keep our country safe and protect the hard-earned freedoms and way of life we enjoy today.” Reporting by Elisabeth O'Leary; Editing by Sandra Maler",
