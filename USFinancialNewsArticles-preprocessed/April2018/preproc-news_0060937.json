    "text": "April 28, 2018 / 5:17 PM / Updated 13 minutes ago Cardiff on the verge of return to Premier League Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Cardiff City will return to the Premier League after four years if they match Fulham’s result in what promises to be a thrilling final weekend in the Championship. Soccer Football - Championship - Hull City v Cardiff City - KCOM Stadium, Hull, Britain - April 28, 2018 Cardiff City's Sean Morrison celebrates after he scores his sides second goal Action Images/Craig Brough\nOne playoff position and relegation issues will also go down to the wire on May 6 when every team in England’s second tier plays.\nCardiff will be home to Reading, who are one of five teams alongside Bolton, Burton, Barnsley and Birmingham struggling to avoid two remaining relegation places alongside Sunderland.\nOn Saturday, two goals from skipper Sean Morrison gave Cardiff a 2-0 win at Hull City to keep manager Neil Warnock on course for a record eighth promotion.\nThe second-placed Bluebirds are one point ahead of Fulham, who are the only team able to deny them promotion alongside Wolverhampton Wanderers, who drew 0-0 with Sheffield Wednesday.\nAston Villa must be content with a playoff place after drawing 1-1 with Derby County.\nMiddlesbrough clinched their own playoff spot with a 2-0 win over Millwall, who would need freak results next week to join them in the promotion shootout.\nDerby effectively need just a point from next week’s visit of Barnsley to secure the fourth playoff spot although Preston North End, who trail Gary Rowett’s side by two points, could profit from any slip up after beating Sheffield United 1-0.\nThat result ended the Blades’ own hopes, with Brentford, 2-0 losers at Barnsley, also dropping out of the running.
