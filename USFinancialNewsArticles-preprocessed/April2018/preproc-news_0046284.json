    "text": "HOUSTON, Carriage Services, Inc. (NYSE:CSV) today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nMel Payne, Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We got off to a good start in 2018 by setting numerous historical first quarter performance records including Total Revenue of $73.4 million (up 7.7%), Total Field EBITDA of $31.2 million (up 5.8%), Consolidated EBITDA of $22.4 million (up 9.2%), GAAP and Adjusted Net Income of $9.4 million and $10.5 million, respectively (up 32.1% and 29.5%), GAAP and Adjusted Diluted EPS of $0.52 and $0.59, respectively (up 33.3% and 31.1%), and Free Cash Flow of $13.4 million (up 110.4%).\nWe experienced the consolidation platform performance fruits of our investment in overhead infrastructure and people during 2017 as we were able to leverage an increase of 7.7% in Total Revenue (50% each from Same Store and Acquisitions) into a 9.2% increase in Consolidated EBITDA, much higher increases of over 30% in both EPS metrics and more than 100% in Free Cash Flow, as Total Overhead declined slightly to $8.8 million but was down materially as a percent of revenue with a decline of 120 basis points to 12.0%. Our Same Store Funeral Contracts and Revenue were up 3.4% and 4.0% (Field EBITDA up 2.9%) while Same Store Cemetery Revenue and Field EBITDA were the sector performance stars in the first quarter with increases of 8.1% and 14.1%, respectively.\nWe are lowering the midpoint of our Rolling Four Quarter Outlook Ranges on revenues by 2.5%, Consolidated EBITDA by 4.2% and Adjusted Diluted EPS by 9.9% due to three specific issues, i.e. an acquisition under LOI (has since lapsed) that didn’t close in the fourth quarter as expected, rising interest costs on our floating rate debt, and a higher diluted share count related to our convertible debt and recent increase in our share price.\nYear to date comparative highlights are shown below:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2017\nRecord Total Revenue of $73.4 million, an increase of 7.7%; Record Net Income of $9.4 million, an increase of 32.1%; Record GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share of $0.52, an increase of 33.3%;\nRecord Total Field EBITDA of $31.2 million, an increase of 5.8%; Total Field EBITDA Margin down 70 basis points to 42.6%; Record Consolidated EBITDA of $22.4 million, an increase of 9.2%; Consolidated EBITDA Margin up 40 basis points to 30.6%; Record Adjusted Net Income of $10.5 million, an increase of 29.5%; Record Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share of $0.59, an increase of 31.1%; and Record Free Cash Flow of $13.4 million, an increase of 110.4%.\nWhile we never claim that a 'good quarter' has much meaning to long term value creation and investors, this particular quarter had historical significance. There were years and years between 2003 and 2011 when I tried to lead, inspire, convince, cajole and 'tough love' coach our corporate and field leadership into believing that we could achieve 50¢/share in annual earnings. While we almost made this annual earnings milestone in 2007 with Adjusted Diluted EPS of 48¢ on revenue of $167.8 million, we had only increased annual Adjusted Diluted EPS to 66¢ on revenue of $190.6 million by 2011 (10¢ benefit from 15% share count reduction in 2008/2009) primarily due to declining margins in our funeral and cemetery portfolios that produced a Consolidated EBITDA Margin of only 22.0% in 2011.\nSo to start off the first quarter of 2018 by achieving a Consolidated EBITDA Margin of 30.6% and 52¢ of GAAP Diluted EPS and 59¢ of Adjusted Diluted EPS is indeed gratifying and confirming that the high performance culture concept of 'First Who, Then What' is alive and well in all areas of our company.\nLast year in my 2016 Shareholder Letter I covered the first 25 year history of our Company which explained the evolution of the unique ideas, concepts and methodologies that comprise the critical elements of Carriage’s High Performance Culture Framework . My 2017 Shareholder Letter covers the evolution of both our current funeral portfolio profile (78% of Total Revenue) and strategic geographical profile at December 31, 2017. I also break down the publicly reported same store funeral consolidated results into a deeply analytical review of performance trends in the larger businesses of our Same Store Funeral Portfolio since 2013 (one subset since 2003), as well as Total Company Revenue and Field EBITDA growth trends since 2006 through execution of our Strategic Acquisition Model.\nMy goal for the 2017 Shareholder Letter was to enable an investor with a long term investment horizon to more fully comprehend the limited downside risks related to our business operations and growth strategy (cremation trends, death rates, acquisitions, leverage, economic and market down cycles, etc.) compared to the strong cash flow fundamentals and considerable upside returns over the next five to ten years as we get better and better at execution of our three core models.\nMy extensive writing about our Company and its reported performance in my 2015, 2016 and 2017 Shareholder Letters was intended to educate and stimulate curiosity by select long term investors as well as 'best in class' acquisition candidates who then want to visit with us in Houston or with any of our field operating businesses. We have learned that analyzing our SEC filings and simply reading or hearing that we have evolved into a High Performance Culture Company that just happens to be in the deathcare industry is often not enough to justify a significant long term ownership position or to come to the realization that we have evolved 'succession plan solutions' that are unimaginable to most high quality business owners.\nWe are very open and transparent for those seeking to learn more about our Company because all of our leaders and employees are extremely proud of the uniqueness of the Being The Best 'idea' of Carriage and the realization that each one of us can make a positive difference in the lives of many others as we continue Carriage’s Good To Great Journey that never ends,” concluded Mr. Payne.\nHIGH PERFORMANCE HEROES\nThe following are High Performance Hero Managing Partners leading us during the first quarter on our Good To Great Journey that never ends:\nAndrew Cumby Cumby Family Funeral Home; High Point, NC Jason Higginbotham Lakeland Funeral Home; Lakeland, FL Ken Duffy John E.

Since the beginning of last year, we have slowly shifted the portfolio towards equity securities, as we found better relative value opportunities versus the high yield market. The overall performance for the quarter was particularly affected by weakness in some segments of our equity portfolio, while the performance of our fixed income portfolio generally tracked the High Yield benchmark.\nFREE CASH FLOW\nWe produced Free Cash Flow from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 of $13.4 million compared to Free Cash Flow from operations of $6.4 million for the corresponding period in 2017. A reconciliation of Cash Flow Provided by Operations to Free Cash Flow for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2018 is as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2017\n2018\nCash flow provided by operations $ 8,159 $ 14,883 Cash used for maintenance capital expenditures (1,773 ) (1,446 ) Free Cash Flow $ 6,386 $ 13,437 ROLLING FOUR QUARTER OUTLOOK\nThe Rolling Four Quarter Outlook (“Outlook”) reflects management’s opinion on the performance of the portfolio of existing businesses, including performance of existing trusts, and excludes size and timing of acquisitions for the Rolling Four Quarter Outlook period ending March 31, 2019 unless we have a signed Letter of Intent and high likelihood of a closing within 90 days. This Outlook is not intended to be management estimates or forecasts of our future performance, as we believe precise estimates will be precisely wrong all the time. Rather our intent and goal is to reflect a “Roughly Right Range” most of the time of future Rolling Four Quarter Outlook performance as we execute our Standards Operating, Strategic Acquisition and 4E Leadership Models over time. Similarly, we self-publish a Company and Investment Profile, available on our website, that includes a Five Year “Roughly Right Scenario” of our future performance which, together with our Five Year Trend Report, provides investors a ten year past and future profile of our financial value creation dynamics and condition, making it easier to judge whether our “trends will continue to be the friend” of long term investors.\nROLLING FOUR QUARTER OUTLOOK – Period Ending March 31, 2019\nRange\n(in millions, except per share amounts) Revenues $274 - $277 Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA $77 - $81 Adjusted Net Income $32 - $34 Adjusted Basic Earnings Per Share (1) $2.00 - $2.05 Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (1) $1.80 - $1.85 Factors affecting our analysis include, among others, funeral contract volumes, average revenue per funeral service, cemetery interment volumes, preneed cemetery sales, capital expenditures, execution of our funeral and cemetery Standards Operating Model, market volatility and changes in Federal Reserve monetary policy. Revenues, Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Basic Earnings Per Share and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share for the four quarter period ending March 31, 2019 are expected to improve relative to the trailing four quarter period ended March 31, 2018 due to increases in our existing Funeral Home and Cemetery portfolio and modest decreases in overhead as a percentage of revenue.\n(1 ) The Rolling Four Quarter Outlook on Adjusted Basic Earnings Per Share and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share does not include any changes to our fully diluted share count that could occur related to additional share repurchases or a stock price increase and EPS dilution calculations related to our convertible subordinated notes and outstanding and exercisable stock options.

Our non-GAAP reporting provides a transparent framework of our operating and financial performance that reflects the earning power of the Company as an operating and consolidation platform.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company’s reported operating results or cash flow from operations or any other measure of performance as determined in accordance with GAAP. We believe the Non-GAAP results are useful to investors to compare our results to previous periods, to provide insight into the underlying long-term performance trends in our business and to provide the opportunity to differentiate ourselves as the best consolidation platform in the industry against the performance of other funeral and cemetery companies.\nThe Company’s GAAP financial statements accompany this release. Reconciliations of the Non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures are provided in this press release.\nThe Non-GAAP financial measures include “Special Items”, “Adjusted Net Income”, “Consolidated EBITDA”, “Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA”, “Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA Margin”, “Free Cash Flow”, “Funeral, Cemetery and Financial EBITDA”, “Total Field EBITDA”, “Total Field EBITDA Margin”, “Divested Revenue”, “Divested EBITDA”, “Divested EBITDA Margin”, “Adjusted Basic Earnings Per Share” and “Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share” in this press release. These financial measurements are defined as similar GAAP items adjusted for Special Items and are reconciled to GAAP in this press release. In addition, the Company’s presentation of these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures in other companies’ reports. The definitions used by the Company for our internal management purposes and in this press release are as follows:\nSpecial Items are defined as charges or credits included in our GAAP financial statements that can vary from period to period and are not reflective of costs incurred in the ordinary course of our operations. Special Items are typically taxed at the federal statutory rate, except for the accretion of the discount on Convertible Subordinated Notes, as this is a non-tax deductible item. Adjusted Net Income is defined as Net Income plus adjustments for Special Items and other expenses or gains that we believe do not directly reflect our core operations and may not be indicative of our normal business operations. Consolidated EBITDA is defined as Net Income before income taxes, interest expenses, non-cash stock compensation, depreciation and amortization, and interest income and other, net. Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA is defined as Consolidated EBITDA plus adjustments for Special Items and other expenses or gains that we believe do not directly reflect our core operations and may not be indicative of our normal business operations. Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operations, adjusted by Special Items as deemed necessary, less cash for maintenance capital expenditures. Funeral Field EBITDA is defined as Funeral Gross Profit, excluding depreciation and amortization, regional and unallocated funeral costs and Financial EBITDA related to the Funeral Home segment. Cemetery Field EBITDA is defined as Cemetery Gross Profit, excluding depreciation and amortization, regional and unallocated cemetery costs and Cemetery Financial EBITDA related to the Cemetery segment. Funeral Financial EBITDA is defined as Funeral Financial Revenue less Funeral Financial Expenses. Cemetery Financial EBITDA is defined as Cemetery Financial Revenue less Cemetery Financial Expenses. Total Field EBITDA is defined as Gross Profit, excluding depreciation and amortization, regional and unallocated funeral and cemetery costs. Total Field EBITDA Margin is defined as Total Field EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. Divested Revenue is defined as revenues from one business sold during 2017. Divested EBITDA is defined as Divested Revenue, less field level and financial expenses related to the sold business noted above. Divested EBITDA Margin is defined as Divested EBITDA as a percentage of Divested Revenue. Adjusted Basic Earnings Per Share is defined as GAAP Basic Earnings Per Share, adjusted for Special Items. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share is defined as GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share, adjusted for Special Items.\nFuneral Field EBITDA and Cemetery Field EBITDA\nOur operations are reported in two business segments: Funeral Home Operations and Cemetery Operations. Our Field level results highlight trends in volumes, Revenues, Field EBITDA (the individual business’ cash earning power / locally controllable business profit) and Field EBITDA Margin (the individual business’ controllable profit margin).\nFuneral Field EBITDA and Cemetery Field EBITDA are defined above. Gross Profit is defined as Revenue less “Field costs and expenses” - a line item encompassing four areas of costs: i) Funeral field costs, ii) Cemetery field costs, iii) depreciation and amortization and iv) regional and unallocated costs. Funeral and Cemetery field costs include funeral merchandise costs, cemetery merchandise costs, operating expenses, labor and other related expenses incurred at the business level.\nRegional and unallocated funeral and cemetery costs presented in our GAAP statement consist primarily of salaries and benefits of our Regional leadership, incentive compensation opportunity to our Field employees and other related costs for field infrastructure. These costs, while necessary to operate our businesses as currently operated within our unique, decentralized platform, are not controllable operating expenses at the Field level as the composition, structure and function of these costs are determined by Executive leadership in the Houston Support Center. These costs are components of our overall overhead platform presented within Consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA. We do not openly or indirectly “push down” any of these expenses to the individual business’ field level margins.\nWe believe that our “Regional and unallocated funeral and cemetery costs” are necessary to support our decentralized, high performance culture operating framework, and as such, are included in Consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA, which more accurately reflects the cash earning power of the Company as an operating and consolidation platform.\nConsolidated EBITDA and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA\nConsolidated EBITDA and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA are defined above. Our Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA include adjustments for Special Items and other expenses or gains that we believe do not directly reflect our core operations and may not be indicative of our normal business operations.\nHow These Measures Are Useful\nWhen used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, our Field EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA are supplemental measures of operating performance that we believe are useful measures to facilitate comparisons to our historical consolidated and business level performance and operating results.\nWe believe our presentation of Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA, key metric used internally by our management, provides investors with a supplemental view of our operating performance that facilitates analysis and comparisons of our ongoing business operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of our ongoing operating performance.\nLimitations of the Usefulness of These Measures\nOur Field EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation. Our presentation is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Funeral Field EBITDA and Cemetery Field EBITDA are not consolidated measures of profitability.\nField EBITDA excludes certain costs presented in our GAAP statement that we do not allocate to the individual business’ field level margins, as noted above. A reconciliation of Field EBITDA to Gross Profit, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is set forth below.\nConsolidated EBITDA excludes certain items that we believe do not directly reflect our core operations and may not be indicative of our normal business operations. A reconciliation of Consolidated EBITDA to Net Income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is set forth below.\nTherefore, these measures may not provide a complete understanding of our performance and should be reviewed in conjunction with our GAAP financial measures.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:\nThis press release includes the use of certain financial measures that are not GAAP measures. The Non-GAAP financial measures are presented for additional information and are reconciled to their most comparable GAAP measures below.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2018 (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2017 2018 Net Income $ 7,084 $ 9,356 Special Items Accretion of Discount on Convertible Subordinated Notes 1,037 1,160 Adjusted Net Income $ 8,121 $ 10,516 Reconciliation of Net Income to Consolidated EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2018 (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2017\n2018\nNet Income $ 7,084 $ 9,356 Net Tax Provision 4,722 2,878 Pre-Tax Income 11,806 12,234 Interest Expense 3,029 3,735 Accretion of Discount on Convertible Subordinated Notes 1,037 1,160 Non-Cash Stock Compensation 836 1,100 Depreciation & Amortization 3,847 4,216 Other, Net (3 ) (2 ) Consolidated EBITDA $ 20,552 $ 22,443 Revenue $ 68,157 $ 73,387 Consolidated EBITDA Margin 30.2 % 30.6 % Reconciliation of Funeral and Cemetery Gross Profit to Field EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2018 (in thousands):\nFuneral Field EBITDA Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2018 Gross Profit (GAAP) $ 18,969 $ 19,664 Depreciation & Amortization 2,369 2,564 Regional & Unallocated Costs 2,444 2,864 Funeral Financial EBITDA (2,043 ) (2,047 ) Divested EBITDA (1 ) 3 Funeral Field EBITDA $ 21,738 $ 23,048\nCemetery Field EBITDA Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2018 Gross Profit (GAAP) $ 4,123 $ 4,524 Depreciation & Amortization 1,102 1,209 Regional & Unallocated Costs 510 417 Cemetery Financial EBITDA (2,087 ) (2,065 ) Cemetery Field EBITDA $ 3,648 $ 4,085\nTotal Field EBITDA Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2018 Funeral Field EBITDA $ 21,738 $ 23,048 Cemetery Field EBITDA 3,648 4,085 Funeral Financial EBITDA 2,043 2,047 Cemetery Financial EBITDA 2,087 2,065 Divested EBITDA 1 (3 ) Total Field EBITDA $ 29,517 $ 31,242 Reconciliation of GAAP Basic Earnings Per Share to Adjusted Basic Earnings Per Share for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2018:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2017 2018 GAAP Basic Earnings Per Share $ 0.42 $ 0.58 Special Items Affecting Net Income 0.06 0.07 Adjusted Basic Earnings Per Share $ 0.48 $ 0.65 Reconciliation of GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share to Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2018:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2017 2018 GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share $ 0.39 $ 0.52 Special Items Affecting Net Income 0.06 0.07 Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share $ 0.45 $ 0.59 Reconciliation of Rolling Four Quarter Outlook:\nEarlier in this press release, we present the Rolling Four Quarter Outlook (“Outlook”) which reflects management’s opinion on the performance of the portfolio of existing businesses, including performance of existing trusts, and excludes size and timing of acquisitions for the Rolling Four Quarter Outlook period ending March 31, 2019 unless we have a signed Letter of Intent and high likelihood of a closing within 90 days. This Outlook is not intended to be management estimates or forecasts of our future performance, as we believe precise estimates will be precisely wrong all the time.

This classification of acquisitions has been important to management and investors in monitoring the results of these businesses and to gauge the leveraging performance contribution that a selective acquisition program can have on total company performance.\nThe presentation below highlights the impact of our 2013 Acquired Portfolio that moved from Acquired to Same Store beginning January 1, 2018 (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2017 Year Ended December 31, 2017 Revenue EBITDA Revenue EBITDA 2013 Acquired Portfolio $ 1,144 $ 519 $ 4,185 $ 1,794 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nCertain statements made herein or elsewhere by, or on behalf of, the Company that are not historical facts are intended to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
