REUTERS/Massoud Hossaini/Pool\n“The government will not intervene in monetary (policy) because it is the policy of Bank Indonesia,” Widodo told reporters, adding that he believed the fundamentals of Southeast Asia’s largest economy were “good”.\nBI Governor Agus Martowardojo last week said he would be prepared to raise the benchmark interest rate if the rupiah’s weakness threatened the bank’s inflation target or disrupted financial market stability.\nThe rupiah has been trading near its lowest since January 2016 in the past week. It traded at 13,870 a dollar at 0310 GMT Monday. Reporting by Maikel Jefriando; Writing by Gayatri Suroyo; Editing by Kim Coghill",
