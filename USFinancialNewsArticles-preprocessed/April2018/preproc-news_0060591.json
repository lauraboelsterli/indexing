    "text": "0 COMMENTS A unit of Panasonic Corp. PCRFY -0.64% admitted to violating an accounting provision of the main U.S. antibribery law, triggering payments to authorities totaling more than $280 million.\nPanasonic Avionics Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Panasonic Corp. of Japan, agreed to pay a $137.4 million criminal penalty to resolve claims it violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The law bars bribing foreign officials to get, or keep, a business advantage, as well as hiding those payments in a company’s books.\nThe parent company, Panasonic Corp., will pay about $143 million of disgorgement—giving up funds gained via its wrongdoing—to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nPanasonic Avionics entered into a deferred-prosecution agreement with the Justice Department charging it with causing the falsification of the financial records of its parent company. The avionics company agreed to continue to cooperate with Justice Department inquiries, enhance its compliance program and retain an independent compliance monitor for at least two years.",
