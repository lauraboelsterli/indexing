This raised its accumulated mobile games users to 189 million. With an abundance of quality products and a first-rate customer service system, the company provides its users with a diverse games library and favorable service, which leads to desirable DAU and retention rate.\nMeanwhile, 37 Interactive Entertainment continued to develop its business in film & television, anime, music, literature, VR/AR, etc. in 2017.

The King of Fighters: Destiny, a brand new CG anime series based on the world-renowned fighting game series of the same name, was also aired during the reporting period.\n37 Interactive Entertainment's rapid growth over the past few years and its brilliant performance in overseas regions have attracted attention from international investors. In 2015, the company was listed as an MSCI A-shares index constituent stock. Shortly after UBS provided coverage of 37 Interactive Entertainment in 2017, Goldman Sachs named the company as one of the \"Nifty 50\" companies in accordance with its \"New China\" portfolio strategy.\n37 Interactive Entertainment will continue to apply its core \"Integration, Globalization, and Diversification\" strategy to develop its business and build a globally-leading entertainment platform.
