    "text": "April 17, 2018 / 3:45 PM / Updated 17 minutes ago Murray & Roberts' second biggest shareholder increases stake amid takeover battle Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nJOHANNESBURG, April 17 (Reuters) - Africa’s biggest pension fund Public Investment Corporation (PIC) has increased its stake in Murray & Roberts to 20 percent after opposing a takeover offer for the South African engineering group. \nMurray & Roberts (M&R) said on Tuesday that PIC had increased its stake to 20.16 percent, from 15.34 percent, a day after PIC rejected a buyout offer for M&R from Germany’s ATON, saying it “materially undervalues” the South African group. \nPIC is Murray & Roberts’ (M&R) second biggest shareholder but its move may not thwart ATON’s ambitions of getting a 50 percent plus one share majority as other shareholders could sell their shares. \nATON, which already owns more than a third of M&R, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nIt made its buyout offer last month, at 15 rand ($1.3) per share, valuing M&R at nearly $600 million. \nM&R said last week that an independent report had showed that a fair offer for the company would be as much as 22 rand ($1.85) per share. \nThe German investment vehicle has increased its stake to 39.8 percent from 33 percent since its bid was announced, after obtaining shares from two top 10 shareholders, including Investment management company Allan Gray, M&R’s third largest shareholder. \nATON requires just over 10 percent to achieve it’s minimum requirement for a potentially successful bid. \nSome of the top 10 shareholders in M&R include Sanlam and Dimensional Fund Advisors with 4.93 percent and 4.72 percent stakes respectively, according to M&R’s shareholder analysis. They have declined to comment. \nOld Mutual was the first to publicly reject the offer saying that it is “below what we believe is fair value.” \nM&R’s shares closed up 1.4 percent on Tuesday at 15.28 rand.
