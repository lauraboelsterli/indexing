    "text": "Amid sweeping changes in the grocery industry, Kroger announced on Tuesday it is hiring for 11,000 new positions, including 2,000 management roles.\nIt is also investing $500 million in associate wages and training and development over the next three years.\nAs an example of the expected wage changes, Kroger cited a labor agreement it recently struck with its worker union in Cincinnati, the UFCW 75. Starting wages will be raised to at least $10 per hour for associates in the Cincinnati/Dayton area. After one year of service, associate wages will rise to $11 an hour.\nKroger has been trying to transform its company as the industry undergoes massive changes, pressured by Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods and changing consumer preferences. Several grocers, including Walmart , have realigned its workforce and resources to readjust to the need to focus more digital efforts, including delivery options.\nOne Kroger effort is the roll out of \"Scan, Bag and Go,\" a platform that allows shoppers to bypass a traditional cashier in paying for items, to 400 locations by the end of this year.",
