The Veteran area was identified as a gap within the Richardson Pioneer crop inputs network in Western Canada. The transaction closed on April 4, 2018.\n“We are excited to expand our business into a new geography as Veteran is a new marketplace for us,” says Tom Hamilton, Vice-President, Agribusiness Operations. “We look forward to building relationships with producers in the area and providing them with leading seed, fertilizer and crop protection technologies in addition to year-round support with our CropWatchTM agronomy team supported by our leading-edge CropMatrixTM platform.”\nEagle Agro Services Ltd. was a family-owned business that was established in Veteran in 2002. All of the employees are now part of the Richardson Pioneer team.\n“This family-owned business is a great addition to our network and we are pleased to welcome the employees to our team,” says Hamilton. “Producers can be assured that they will be dealing with the same people at the location and we will build on the trust and level of service to which they have been accustomed.”\nRichardson Pioneer is a division of Richardson International Limited, Canada’s leading agribusiness.
