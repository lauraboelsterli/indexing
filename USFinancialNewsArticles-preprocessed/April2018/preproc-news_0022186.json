    "text": "HOUSTON, April 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: RICK) today announced total and same-store sales for its Nightclubs and Bombshells restaurant segments for the second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018. The company plans to report complete 2Q18 results on May 10, 2018.\n2Q18 vs. 2Q17\nTotal club and restaurant sales: $40.8 million compared to $34.0 million Consolidated same-store sales: $35.3 million compared to $33.7 million Nightclubs segment sales: $35.2 million compared to $29.7 million (38 units vs. 37) Bombshells restaurant segment sales: $5.6 million compared to $4.4 million (5 units vs. 4)\nCEO Comment\nEric Langan, President and CEO, commented: \"Fiscal 2018 sales have continued to do well with record second quarter club and restaurant sales and strong same-store sales, in line with the positive year over year trends we've been seeing.\n\"Sales improved across the board in 2Q18. Nightclubs increased 18.5% in total sales and 5.1% on a same-store basis, while Bombshells grew 28.0% in total sales and 2.7% on a same-store basis. New units added $5.4 million in sales, primarily due to Scarlett's Cabaret Miami, which we acquired in 3Q17, and the second full quarter of Bombshells Restaurant & Bar on Highway 290 in Houston.\n\"January was good despite tough weather in some markets. February benefitted from traffic in multiple markets created by the pro football championship. March was our strongest month in the quarter for both segments, in particular, our Bombshells sports bars in Texas, which were driven by the continued success of the Houston Rockets and major college basketball tournaments.\n\"During 2Q18, the status of two small clubs changed. We decided to close Club Onyx Dallas after numerous attempts to improve results. We are now actively marketing the property. We also closed Hollywood Hunt Club and are now renting out the property.\n\"To sum up, our existing portfolio of clubs and restaurants are doing well. On top of this, we have the imminent opening of our newest Bombshells in the fast growing Houston suburb of Pearland, and three more Bombshells in various stages of development in the Greater Houston market. In addition, we have renewed our discussions with prospective club acquisition targets.\"\nNotes\nNightclubs and Bombshells segment sales do not include sales from non-core operations. Sales numbers are preliminary and subject to final closing. Unit counts are at period end.
