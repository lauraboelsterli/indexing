    "text": "PHOENIX, April 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Alpine 4 Technologies (ALPP) continued its acquisition strategy today with the announcement that it has completed its acquisition of American Precision Fabricators, Inc. (APF). This acquisition adds to Alpine 4's tech manufacturing sector play, which began in 2016 with its purchase of Quality Circuit Assembly, Inc. It also is the fourth acquisition that Alpine 4 has made in two years.\nAbout American Precision Fabricators: APF is an Arkansas based corporation established in 1996. For over two decades, APF has been an industry leader for customers in the OEM markets, fabricating and manufacturing components and products for many Fortune 1000 customers.

APF has a demonstrated reputation for impressive compliance and procedural standards showcased throughout its past audit and inspection history.\nKent B. Wilson, CEO of Alpine 4, had this to say: \"We're excited about adding APF to the Alpine 4 family. The addition of APF will a have an immediate impact on Q2 earnings and APF is expected to have a significant role as a Facilitator in the Alpine 4 umbrella of companies.\"\nLearn more about Alpine 4 and our Driver, Stabilizer, Facilitator (DSF) business model at www.alppinfo.com\nBenefits of the Transaction:\nSynergies - The Alpine 4 acquisition of APF will leverage complementary strengths between its subsidiary Quality Circuit Assembly, Inc.

Alpine 4 believes this will yield an additional $2.5 million in annual sales between the two companies over the next 18 months.\nIncreased Shareholder Value - This transaction will result in a positive adjustment to Alpine 4's Shareholder Equity, and we anticipate it adding add $5-6m in annual sales to Alpine 4 over the next 12 months.\nTerry W. Protto, VP of Portfolio Management, commented: \"APF and QCA manage a similar set of production metrics or KPI's such as Make Span, Flow Time, Inventory Management, Work Station and Floor Time Management.\" This in combination with world class quality, customer care, and fulfillment performance, set the two companies at the pinnacle of their respective market spaces. We are excited to bring APF into the Alpine 4 family.\nAbout Alpine 4 Technologies, Ltd.\nAlpine 4 is a publicly traded enterprise with business-related endeavors in Automotive Technologies, Electronics Manufacturing, Engineering and Software development, and Energy Services.\nFour principles at the core of our business are our motto called SIDE (Synergy, Innovation, Drive, and Excellence).
