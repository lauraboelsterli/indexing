    "text": "The Boston Red Sox continued their historic start to the season, beating the Los Angeles Angels 8-2 Thursday night in Anaheim, Calif., to complete a three-game sweep and extend their winning streak to seven games.\nBoston improved to 16-2, the best start through 18 games in the franchise’s 118-year history. The Red Sox outscored the Angels 27-3 in the series.\nJ.D. Martinez and Rafael Devers each had three hits, while both Mookie Betts and Andrew Benintendi bashed home runs in the Red Sox’s 14-hit onslaught.\nRed Sox starter Eduardo Rodriguez (2-0) got the win after throwing six innings, allowing two runs on three hits and three walks. He struck out five.\nAs they did in the first two games of the series, the Red Sox jumped to a lead in the first inning. And again it was Betts in the middle of things, Boston’s right fielder leading off the game with a home run off Angels starter Nick Tropeano.\nIt was his sixth homer of the season, his fourth in the series. It also marked the 13th time in his career he has led off the first inning with a home run, extending his Red Sox record.\nThe Angels got the run back in the second inning against Rodriguez, Zack Cozart’s RBI single tying the game at 1-1.\nBoston pushed across two runs in the fourth, one on an RBI double by Martinez and one on an RBI single by Devers, to go ahead 3-1.\nChris Young, getting a start in right field in place of Kole Calhoun, hit his first home run of the season to get the Angels to within 3-2 in the fifth, but Boston got it right back in the sixth on a solo homer by Benintendi.\nTropeano couldn’t get out of the sixth, Angels manager Mike Scioscia taking out the right-hander with one on and one out. The Angels’ bullpen, though, was unable to quell the rally, and the Red Sox added another run in the inning for a 5-2 lead.\nIt could have been worse for the Angels in the inning if not for a spectacular play by shortstop Andrelton Simmons, who made a diving stop of a ball hit up the middle by Eduardo Nunez. Simmons flipped the ball with his glove to second baseman Ian Kinsler, who made the relay to first to complete an inning-ending double play.\nTropeano (1-1) lasted 5 1/3 innings, giving up five runs on seven hits and two walks while striking out three.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
