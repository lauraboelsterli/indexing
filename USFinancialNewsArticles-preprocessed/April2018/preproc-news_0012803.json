    "text": "April 6, 2018 / 4:21 PM / Updated an hour ago Exclusive: Ukraine's largest airline may sue again in tussle with Ryanair Matthias Williams , Pavel Polityuk 4 Min Read \nKIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine’s largest airline may launch new legal action over the entry of Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair ( RYA.I ) into the market if its complaints over airport slots are not addressed, its chief executive told Reuters on Friday.

REUTERS/Gleb Garanich//File Photo \nThe Western-backed government feted Ryanair’s expected arrival in September as a sign of its pro-business credentials to attract foreign investors and prise open sectors traditionally dominated by local tycoons. \nBut Ukraine International Airlines, which is part-owned by one of the country’s richest magnates, Ihor Kolomoisky, says the Kiev authorities have gone out of their way to support Ryanair while being slow to help local carriers grow. \nUIA launched legal action against the government last year and Ryanair walked away from talks saying Ukraine was “not yet a sufficiently mature or reliable business location”. Ryanair returned after more negotiations backed by the president. \nIn his first interview since Ryanair announced its entry on March 23, UIA’s CEO Yuri Miroshnikov said Ryanair has started selling tickets for flights at Kiev’s Boryspil airport without getting permission for the timings.

What’s more, they haven’t even asked us about slots yet,” it said by email. \nRyanair would either have to move its flights to off-peak hours or increase the number of flights to 15 a day from their stated number of 4-5 flights, which would make it economically viable for the airport to open another terminal, it said. \n“I sincerely hope that the president of Ukraine or the infrastructure minister won’t concern themselves with slot issues,” Infrastructure Minister Volodymyr Omelyan said. “I don’t have a single doubt that Ryanair will start flights and the people who have already bought or are buying tickets will use the services of this airline.” \nUIA says it is in favor of competition provided that it is fair, and the new incentives the government has offered to all airlines in the wake of negotiations with Ryanair, which include lower airport taxes, will also benefit UIA. \nIt was a “good outcome for the wrong reason,” Miroshnikov said.
