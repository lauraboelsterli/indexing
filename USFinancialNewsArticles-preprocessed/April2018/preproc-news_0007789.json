MedLabs also intends to roll out new technology platforms and tools for its existing client base to further increase the impact a laboratory can have on patient outcomes in today's value-based healthcare market.\n\"We are very excited to find financial partners with similar values and proven track records as well as those with a commitment to help MedLabs achieve its goal of becoming a national reference laboratory,\" said Nick Mitilenes, recently appointed President of MedLabs. \"The funding provided by Caymus and PNC will accelerate our current growth initiatives as well as allow for acquisition of other laboratories and healthcare companies in order for us to expand our footprint and further build our strategic position.\"\nMedLabs, already one of the fastest growing independent clinical diagnostic laboratories, expects that this investment will fuel years of continued growth and innovation.\nMedLabs Diagnostics is one of the oldest, independent reference laboratories in the United States with headquarters in Cedar Knolls, NJ.

The cornerstone of their investment philosophy is to partner with talented management teams and invest in companies that have reached an inflection point and provide value capital to maximize growth opportunities. Similarly, PNC Mezzanine Capital has supported entrepreneurs in a wide range of industries, typically investing in companies with strong management teams, proven business models and stable cash flows with a clear avenue for growth.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/medlabs-diagnostics-completes-recapitalization-with-caymus-equity-partners-and-pnc-mezzanine-capital-300623432.html\nSOURCE MedLabs Diagnostics",
