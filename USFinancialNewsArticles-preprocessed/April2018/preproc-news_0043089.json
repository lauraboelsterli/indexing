    "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY, April 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- BancFirst Corporation (NASDAQ GS:BANF) reported net income of $29.6 million, or $0.89 diluted earnings per share, for the first quarter of 2018 compared to net income of $22.1 million, or $0.68 diluted earnings per share, for the first quarter of 2017. On January 11, 2018 the Company completed the acquisitions of two Oklahoma banking corporations. Consequently, the first quarter of 2018 included one-time acquisition related expenses of approximately $2.2 million, which reduced diluted earnings per share by approximately 5 cents. Net income for the first quarter of 2017 included the effects of favorable resolutions of two problem loans which resulted in principal recovery of $894,000 and unaccrued interest income of $2.3 million.\nThe Company's net interest income for the first quarter of 2018 increased to $63.0 million compared to $54.8 million for the first quarter of 2017. The net interest margin for the quarter was 3.66% compared to 3.39% a year ago. The increase in margin was primarily due to the increase in the federal funds rate throughout 2017 and the first quarter of 2018 and the two acquisitions. The provision for loan losses for the first quarter of 2018 was $314,000 compared to $72,000 a year ago. Net charge-offs for the quarter were 0.01% of average loans, compared to 0.02% for the first quarter of 2017. Noninterest income for the quarter totaled $30.1 million, compared to $28.1 million last year. Noninterest expense for the quarter totaled $55.9 million compared to $49.6 million last year. The increase in noninterest expense was due to salary increases in 2018 and the two acquisitions. The Company's effective tax rate was 19.8% compared to 33.6% for the first quarter of 2017 and added approximately 15 cents to first quarter diluted earnings per share. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due to the change in tax rates from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and exercising of stock options during the quarter.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company's total assets were $7.6 billion, an increase of $362.5 million from December 31, 2017. The increase in total assets was primarily related to the acquisitions during the quarter. Securities of $493.1 million were up slightly from December 31, 2017. Loans totaled $5.0 billion, an increase of $262.5 million from December 31, 2017. Excluding acquired loans of $307.1 million, loans were slightly down from December 31, 2017. Deposits totaled $6.7 billion, an increase of $298.0 million from the December 31, 2017 total, of which $292.8 million was related to the acquisitions. The Company's total stockholders' equity was $838.1 million, an increase of $62.5 million over December 31, 2017.\nAsset quality remained strong during the first quarter of 2018. Nonperforming and restructured assets were 0.69% of total assets at March 31, 2018 compared to 0.61% at December 31, 2017. The allowance to total loans was 1.03% compared to 1.09% at year-end 2017. The allowance to nonperforming and restructured loans was 105.9% compared to 130.6% at year-end 2017.\nOn January 11, 2018, the Company completed the previously announced acquisitions of two Oklahoma banking corporations. First Wagoner Corporation and its subsidiary bank, First Bank & Trust Company, and First Chandler Corp. and its subsidiary bank, First Bank of Chandler, had combined total assets of approximately $373 million. The Company exchanged a combination of cash and stock for these transactions.\nExecutive Chairman David Rainbolt commented, \"The confluence of reduced corporate income tax, increasing interest rates, a stable Oklahoma economy, and quality acquisitions resulted in a strong quarter for us.\"\nBancFirst Corporation is an Oklahoma based financial services holding company. The Company's principal subsidiary bank, BancFirst, is Oklahoma's largest state-chartered bank with 107 banking locations serving 58 communities across Oklahoma.
