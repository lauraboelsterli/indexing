    "text": "BRASILIA (Reuters) - Embraer SA ( EMBR3.SA ) and Boeing Co ( BA.N ) are discussing setting up a new company focused on commercial aviation but have not yet reached an accord, the Brazilian planemaker said in a Thursday securities filing.\nThe Boeing building is seen next to Boeing Field in Seattle, Washington, U.S., March 26, 2018. REUTERS/Lindsey Wasson The arrangement would exclude Embraer’s defense and “potentially” its business jet divisions from the alliance, the filing said. Reuters reported earlier in the day that a new proposal had been submitted to Brazil’s government on Tuesday but there were still issues to be ironed out.\nReporting by Bruno Federowski; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ",
