We were also very pleased with the momentum of our Consumer Direct business, especially the continued progress of our Robert Graham stores during the quarter, which were up 7% for the quarter on a comparable basis with store net sales momentum continuing into Q1 2018. Robert Graham ecommerce, in particular, saw both more traffic and a greater conversion rate during the 4 th quarter. SWIMS continued to compound its top line, growing 40% during the quarter as a result of European growth and the opening of an additional store during the quarter compared to the same quarter last year. SWIMS also continued to expand its US based brand awareness and distribution points. Lastly, Hudson continued to post solid Wholesale performance, increasing Wholesale channel sales by 5%.”\nMr. Buckley continued, “For the upcoming 2018 fiscal year, we have planned several key initiatives within each of the respective brands. At the Hudson brand, we plan to test limited retail stores in the United States and we are in development of a new line of sportswear to complement our denim products for the Fall 2018 season. We are also investing in additional sales staff at Hudson to help grow our diversified and important specialty store business across the country. At Robert Graham, we are adding additional catalog drops and circulation, as well as expanding the Robert Graham assortment, through licensing, to include home furnishings and additional accessory styles. Lastly, at SWIMS we are offering an expanded assortment of footwear starting Spring 2018, to go along with our outerwear line in Europe for Fall 2018. We also will be adding our first full price SWIMS store at a key high street location in Oslo, Norway in Fall 2018.”\nSegment net sales and adjusted EBITDA results were as follows:\nThree months ended December 31, Twelve months ended December 31, * 2017 2016 2017 2016 (unaudited, in thousands) (unaudited, in thousands) Net sales: Wholesale $ 30,218 $ 28,534 $ 119,128 $ 108,829 Consumer Direct 14,136 13,132 42,095 38,622 Corporate and other 755 353 2,830 1,816 Total Company net sales $ 45,109 $ 42,019 $ 164,053 $ 149,267 Adjusted EBITDA Operating income (loss): Wholesale $ 5,668 $ 4,776 $ 27,826 $ 21,101 Consumer Direct 2,295 314 1,523 (2,216 ) Corporate and other (7,603 ) (7,976 ) (28,273 ) (29,038 ) Adjustments** 2,780 5,007 9,747 18,863 Total Company Adjusted EBITDA $ 3,140 $ 2,121 $ 10,823 $ 8,710 *For the 2016, net sales and Adjusted EBITDA reflect the operations of Robert Graham for the full 2016, Hudson for the eleven months ended since January 28, 2016, and SWIMS for the five months ended since July 18, 2016. For the 2017, net sales and Adjusted EBITDA include all three brands: Robert Graham, Hudson and SWIMS. See further discussion at “Basis of Presentation of Information” below.\n**See “Adjusted EBITDA” below for reconciliation with GAAP.\nFourth Quarter Financial Review\nTotal Company net sales for the three months ended December 31, 2017, increased 7% to $45.1 million, reflecting a 6% increase in Wholesale segment sales and an 8% increase in Consumer Direct segment sales. The Wholesale increase was driven by 40% growth at SWIMS, as well as by modest growth from the Hudson brand, primarily at full price specialty store doors. Robert Graham Wholesale was down marginally for the quarter, (1% year over year) due primarily to the timing of certain off-price shipments that were moved into January 2018. The increase in the Consumer Direct segment was led by retail store growth of 10%.\nGross profit was $18.9 million, compared to $16.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, primarily related to the comparable increase in sales volume. Total Company gross margin was 41.9% compared to 39.9% in the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of better initial margins across all brands.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, were $16.8 million compared to $16.2 million in the same period of the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expense rate decreased to 37% from 39% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOperating income was $0.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to an operating loss of $2.9 million for the same period last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $3.1 million as compared to $2.1 million in the same quarter last year.\nAnnual Financial Review\nTotal Company net sales for 2017, increased 10% to $164.1 million compared to $149.3 million in the prior year, reflecting a 9% increase in Wholesale segment sales and a 9% increase in Consumer Direct segment sales.\nGross profit was $71.8 million for the 2017 compared to $61.3 million for the same period last year. Total Company gross margin was 43.7% compared to 41.1% for the 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the 2017 were $64.4 million compared to $63.2 million for the same period of the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expense rate decreased to 39% from 42% in the 2016.\nOperating income from continuing operations was $1.1 million for the 2017, compared to operating losses from continuing operations of $10.2 million for the same period last year.\nBasis of Presentation of Information\nAs previously disclosed, on January 28, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition (the “ RG Merger ”) of all outstanding equity interests of RG Parent LLC and its subsidiaries, or the Robert Graham business (“ RG ”). Because RG was deemed the accounting acquirer for financial reporting purposes, the assets, liabilities and operations of the Company prior to January 28, 2016 that are reflected in the financial statements for the 2016 reflect only RG’s financial condition and results of operations and do not include Hudson or SWIMS. More specifically, the Company’s consolidated financial statements, as presented in part in this press release, included: (i) from January 1, 2016 up to the day prior to the closing of the RG Merger on January 28, 2016, the results of operations and cash flows of RG; (ii) from and after the RG Merger’s closing date on January 28, 2016, the results of continuing operations, cash flows and, as applicable, the assets and liabilities of the combined Company, comprising the Company’s Hudson business and RG; (iii) from and after the RG Merger’s closing date on January 28, 2016, the results of the discontinued operations from the Company’s previously owned Joe’s brand retail stores that later closed by February 29, 2016; and (iv) from and after the acquisition of SWIMS on July 18, 2016, the results of continuing operations and cash flows and, as applicable, the assets and liabilities of SWIMS.\nAbout Differential Brands Group\nDifferential Brands Group Inc.

1,966 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, at end of year $ 8,250 $ 6,476 Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the (i) effect of transaction expenses associated with the RG Merger and SWIMS acquisition (including acquisition-related costs, restructuring costs and the non-cash inventory expense of the Hudson and SWIMS inventory acquired and stepped up to fair value that was sold) during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and (ii) other provisions and expenses during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts which are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the performance of the business over time on a consistent basis, identify business trends relating to the financial condition and results of operations and make business decisions. The Company believes that providing non-GAAP measures is useful to provide a consistent basis for investors to understand the Company’s financial performance in comparison to historical periods and to allow investors to evaluate the performance using the same methodology and information as that used by management. However, investors need to be aware that non-GAAP measures are subject to inherent limitations because they do not include all of the expenses included under GAAP and they involve the exercise of judgment of which charges are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measure. Investors should consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as substitutes for or superior to, the Company’s other measures of the Company’s financial performance that the Company prepares in accordance with GAAP. Further, non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180402005869/en/\nInvestor Relations\nDifferential Brands Group Inc.\nBob Ross, Chief Financial Officer\n323.558.5115\nSource: Differential Brands Group Inc.",
