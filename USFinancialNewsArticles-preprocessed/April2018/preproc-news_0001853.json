    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Joseph Saveri Law Firm, a national boutique firm specializing in representing plaintiffs in complex civil litigation, antitrust suits, and class actions announced today that top antitrust and class action lawyer Steven N. Williams has joined the firm. Williams will be joining the firm as a partner – the first partner to join the firm since Joseph Saveri founded it in 2012.\nWilliams, previously a long-time partner at Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy, LLP, practices in the fields of litigation, trial, and client counseling, with an emphasis on representation of civil plaintiffs in antitrust matters. He also brings experience in First Amendment defense, securities, environmental, and general business litigation. He has served in leadership positions in more than a dozen antitrust class cases throughout his 25-year career. Williams is rated AV Preeminent by Martindale Hubbell and a Band 2 top antitrust lawyer by Chambers USA, and has repeatedly been named to the top 100 lawyers by Thomson Reuters Super Lawyers.\n“Steve is one of the most accomplished antitrust and class action lawyers in the country, delivering exceptional results for his clients time and time again,” said Joseph Saveri, the firm’s founder. “I’ve known and admired him for years and am confident he will prove to be a highly valuable member of our team as we continue to provide current and future clients with top-level legal representation and service.”\n“Joe has built a terrific team that has achieved tremendous success in a short period of time, and I’m honored to join it,” said Williams. “It’s hard to think of a prominent antitrust case in California over the last 20 years in which Joe or I didn’t play a prominent role. With our combined complementary experience, we’ll be a formidable national force.”\nWilliams’ current caseload includes representing a class alleging that Nestle Waters of North America has been misleading consumers for years by falsely claiming that its “Poland Spring” water is natural spring water, and leading a class action alleging that Pfizer and Mylan—manufacturer and distributor of the EpiPen, respectively—have unlawfully created and abused a monopoly for the essential, life-saving product.\nWilliams, described as “absolutely fantastic” by peers in Chambers USA, is in leadership for the American Bar Association Antitrust Section, a member of the International Cartel Task Force, a member of the Advisory Board of the American Antitrust Institute, and a member of the Executive Committee to Save the Antitrust Laws. He is a Board member of Public Justice; an advisor to the California Lawyers Association Section on Antitrust, Unfair Competition and Privacy Law; and was chair of the 2017 Golden State Antitrust Institute. He earned his J.D. from Fordham University School of Law and his B.A. from New York University.\nAbout the Joseph Saveri Law Firm\nSan Francisco-based Joseph Saveri Law Firm, Inc. fights anticompetitive business practices and handles complex business litigation matters throughout the country. Its attorneys serve as lead and co-counsel on a variety of lawsuits involving price-fixing, illegal reverse-payment agreements, agreements regarding hiring and recruiting, and antitrust cases involving sports leagues and other industries.

The firm has been selected by U.S. News & World Report and Best Lawyers in 2013-2018 for inclusion in their annual joint Best Law Firms publication.
