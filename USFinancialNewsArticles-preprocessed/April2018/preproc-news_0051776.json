(Nasdaq:FSLR) today announced financial results for the first quarter 2018. Net sales for the first quarter were $567 million, an increase of $228 million from the prior quarter due to the sale of international projects in India and Japan and the sale of the Rosamond project in the U.S., partially offset by lower third-party module sales.\nThe Company reported first quarter GAAP earnings per share (“EPS”) of $0.78, compared to a GAAP loss per share of $(4.14) in the fourth quarter of 2017. The previous quarter non-GAAP loss per share, adjusted for restructuring and asset impairment charges and the impact of U.S. tax reform, was $(0.25). Net income increased compared to the prior quarter primarily as a result of lower tax expense, improved net sales, the mix of higher gross profit projects and higher other income.\nCash and marketable securities at the end of the first quarter decreased slightly to $2.9 billion from $3.0 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. The decrease primarily resulted from capital expenditures to support the Series 6 manufacturing ramp, partially offset by a reimbursement of overfunded amounts from our module collection and recycling trust.\n“Our first quarter earnings and continued bookings momentum provide a positive start to the year,” said Mark Widmar, CEO of First Solar. “Our earnings for the quarter were supported by the sale of both domestic and international projects, combined with efficient management of core operating expenses. Customer demand for our Series 6 product continues to be strong as evidenced by our year-to-date net bookings of 3.3GW DC . We also achieved significant technology milestones this month with the start of Series 6 production in Ohio and the first commercial module shipments to systems projects. We remain focused on leveraging the advantages of our differentiated technology and applying our disciplined operating approach to achieve our near-term and long-term priorities.”\nThe Company lowered its 2018 net cash guidance by $100 million primarily as a result of higher capital expenditures for additional Series 6 capacity.\n2018 GAAP Guidance Prior Current Net Sales $2.45B to $2.65B Unchanged Gross Margin % 1 21.5% to 22.5% Unchanged Operating Expenses 2 $400M to $410M Unchanged Operating Income $130M to $180M Unchanged Earnings per Share $1.50 to $1.90 Unchanged Net Cash Balance 3 $2.1B to $2.3B $2.0B to $2.2B Operating Cash Flow $100M to $200M $0 to $100M Capital Expenditures $700M to $800M $850M to $950M Shipments 2.9GW to 3.0GW Unchanged Includes approximately $60 million of ramp penalty costs Includes approximately $120 million of production start-up expense Defined as cash and marketable securities less expected debt at the end of 2018\nFor a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measure presented above to the corresponding measure presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), see the tables below.\nFirst Solar has scheduled a conference call for today, April 26, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. ET to discuss this announcement.

We have included this non-GAAP financial measure to adjust for (i) restructuring, asset impairment and related charges primarily associated with the transition from Series 4 to Series 6 production, (ii) the tax effect associated with these items and (iii) the tax effect associated with U.S. tax reform. We believe non-GAAP earnings per share, when taken together with corresponding GAAP financial measure, is relevant and useful information to our investors because it provides them with additional information in assessing our financial operating results. Our management uses this non-GAAP financial measure in evaluating our operating performance. However, this measure has limitations, including that it excludes the effect of certain changes to our assets and liabilities and certain amounts that we may ultimately have to pay in cash. Accordingly, this non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to earnings per share prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following is the reconciliation of earnings per share prepared in accordance with GAAP to non-GAAP earnings per share for the period presented (in millions, except per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Net loss $ (432.5) Restructuring and asset impairments (1.9) Tax effect of restructuring and asset impairments* 0.2 Tax effect of U.S. tax reform $ 408.1 Non-GAAP net loss $ (26.1) Weighted-average number of shares used for diluted earnings per share 104.4 GAAP loss per share $ (4.14) Non-GAAP loss per share $ (0.25) * Restructuring treated as a non-discrete item for tax purposes and reflected in the effective tax rate over the duration of 2017.\nSource:First Solar, Inc.",
