    "text": "SAN ANTONIO, April 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. (NYSE:CFR) today reported first quarter 2018 results. Net income available to common shareholders for the first quarter of 2018 was $104.5 million, compared to $82.9 million in the first quarter of 2017, representing an increase of 26 percent. On a per-share basis, net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.61 per diluted common share, compared to $1.28 per diluted common share reported a year earlier. Returns on average assets and common equity were 1.36 percent and 13.62 percent, respectively, for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 1.12 percent and 11.55 percent, respectively, for the same period a year earlier.\nFor the first quarter of 2018 net interest income was $229.7 million, up 10.2 percent compared to the same quarter in 2017. Average loans for the first quarter of 2018 increased $1.2 billion, or 10.0 percent, to $13.3 billion, from the $12.1 billion reported for the first quarter a year earlier. Average deposits for the quarter were $26.4 billion compared to $25.8 billion reported for last year's first quarter, an increase of 2.4 percent.\n\"The solid first-quarter earnings represent a great start to 2018,\" said Cullen/Frost Chairman and CEO Phil Green. \"Frost is well-positioned to benefit as interest rates tick higher, and our customers continue to benefit from the economic expansion in Texas and across the country. At the same time, our value proposition and commitment to customer service have helped us expand our customer base, and have paid off with recognition from third-party sources like J.D. Power and Associates, which for the ninth consecutive year gave Frost the highest customer satisfaction ranking among banks in Texas.\n\"We believe our focus on building and cultivating long-term relationships with our customers will continue to benefit us in good times and in bad, and we continue to instill the Frost culture in everything that we do.\"\nNoted financial data for the first quarter of 2018 follows:\nThe Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and Total Risk-Based Capital Ratios at the end of the first quarter of 2018 were 12.69 percent, 13.42 percent and 15.36 percent, respectively, and continue to be in excess of well-capitalized levels. Current capital ratios exceed Basel III fully phased-in requirements. Net interest income of $229.7 million represented a 10.2 percent increase over the prior year period. The net interest margin was 3.52 percent for the first quarter of 2018. First quarter 2018 net interest margin represented a 13 basis point increase over the fourth quarter of 2017, when adjusted for the 21 percent corporate tax rate. Net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 as reported was 3.70 percent, based on a 35 percent corporate tax rate. Non-interest income for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $91.4 million, an increase of $7.7 million, or 9.3 percent, compared to $83.7 million reported for the first quarter of 2017. Other non-interest income increased $5.4 million compared to the first quarter of 2017. This increase was primarily related to an increase of $3.8 million in gains on the sale of foreclosed and other assets and income from customer derivative and trading activities. Trust and investment management fees were $29.6 million, up $3.1 million, or 11.8 percent, from the first quarter of 2017. Higher trust and investment management fees were primarily driven by strong performance in equity markets. Insurance commissions and fees were $16.0 million, up $2.2 million, or 15.6 percent, compared to the $13.8 million reported in the first quarter a year earlier. The increase was driven by increases in both benefits insurance commissions and property and casualty commissions, as well as by an increase in contingent income. Non-interest expense was $196.6 million for the quarter, up $8.7 million or 4.6 percent compared to the $187.9 million reported for the first quarter a year earlier. Total salaries rose $4.2 million, or 5.1 percent, to $86.7 million, and were impacted by normal annual merit and market increases. Technology, furniture and equipment expense for the first quarter increased by $1.7 million or 9.4 percent from the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily driven by a $1.3 million increase in software maintenance expense. Included in other expense for the first quarter of 2018 was a $3.7 million contribution to the Frost Bank Charitable Foundation. For the first quarter of 2018, the provision for loan losses was $6.9 million, compared to net charge-offs of $12.4 million. This compares with $8.1 million in provisions and $7.0 million in net charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2017, and $8.0 million in provisions and $7.9 million in net charge-offs in the first quarter of 2017. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.12 percent at March 31, 2018, compared to 1.26 percent at the end of the first quarter of 2017 and 1.18 percent at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017. Non-performing assets were $136.6 million at the end of the first quarter of 2018, compared to $118.2 million at the end of the first quarter of 2017 and $157.3 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017. The interchange and debit card transaction fees category of non-interest income and the other expense category were each impacted by our adoption at the beginning of 2018 of a new accounting standard that affects how we report revenues and network costs associated with ATM and debit card network transactions. Prior to 2018, we recognized such revenues and network costs on a gross basis. Beginning in 2018, ATM and debit card transaction fees are reported net of related network costs. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, gross interchange and debit card transaction fees totaled $6.1 million while related network costs totaled $2.9 million. On a net basis, we reported $3.2 million as interchange and debit card transaction fees. See note 2 on page 6 of this release, and our forthcoming form 10-Q for more information on the effects of this and other accounting changes.\nThe Cullen/Frost board also declared a second-quarter cash dividend of $0.67 per common share, representing a 17.5% increase over the previous year's dividend, payable June 15, 2018 to shareholders of record on May 31 of this year. The board of directors also declared a cash dividend of $.3359375 per share of the Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, which is traded on the NYSE under the symbol \"CFR PrA.\" The Series A Preferred Stock dividend is also payable on June 15, 2018, to shareholders of record on May 31 of this year.\nCullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. will host a conference call on Thursday, April 26, 2018, at 10 a.m. Central Time (CT) to discuss the results for the quarter.
