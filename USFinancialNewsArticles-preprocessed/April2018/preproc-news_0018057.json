    "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C., April 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Cato Corporation (NYSE: CATO) today reported sales for the five weeks ended April 7, 2018 of $96.9 million, a 4% increase over sales of $93.1 million for the five week period ended April 1, 2017. Same-store sales for the five weeks ended April 7, 2018 increased 6% from the five weeks ended April 8, 2017. March 2018 same-store sales are compared to the five week period ended April 8, 2017 due to the 53 rd week in fiscal 2017.\n\"March sales were positively impacted by the shift of Easter from April last year to March this year,\" stated John Cato, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. \"Due to this shift, the best way to measure our performance is by combining sales for the two months. We expect April same-store sales to be in the high negative single digits and the combined two months' same-store sales to be in the low negative single digits.\"\nAs of April 7, 2018, the Company operated 1,351 stores in 33 states, compared to 1,373 stores in 33 states as of April 1, 2017.\nThe Cato Corporation is a leading specialty retailer of value-priced fashion apparel and accessories operating three concepts, \"Cato\", \"Versona\" and \"It's Fashion\".
