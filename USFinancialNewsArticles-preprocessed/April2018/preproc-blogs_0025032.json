Photo: Associated Press \nHollywood, Fla.—An in-house Barclays PLC warning system helped U.K. authorities identify terror networks, effectively preventing attacks, a top compliance executive from the bank said Tuesday at an anti-money laundering conference.\nBarclays developed the warning system, taking red-flag indicators it finds after a terrorist incident and collecting them to create monitoring tools, said Frederick Reynolds, head of the bank’s financial crime legal department.\nThe system captures “a vast amount” of bank transactions across the U.K. and Europe, while a task force uses analytics to look for interconnectivity across risk factors and to spot potential future terrorist activity, he said.\n“We did in fact interdict people in the terrorist cycle,” said Mr. Reynolds, declining to specify the attacks involved other than to say they were in the early-planning stages.\nMr. Reynolds, who was deputy director of the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network before joining the private sector, spoke during a counter-terrorism panel at the ACAMS moneylaundering.com International AML and Financial Crime Conference.\nBarclays has a reactive counter-terrorism posture in addition to the warning system, he said. The bank assembles a team within about an hour after a terrorist attack to comb through financial and public-source data to develop a package for authorities whenever they call, he said. Law enforcement often contacts the bank in the hours after an attack, seeking information, he said.\nCompliance officers need to use the information at their disposal to develop a counter-terrorism response, said Mr. Reynolds. For example, he said a bank’s automated teller network machines will have cameras and compliance can pull footage from those cameras to help with investigations.\n“You can see in real time an indicator of where they [the terrorist] may be,” he said.\nWrite to Samuel Rubenfeld at Samuel.Rubenfeld@wsj.com.
