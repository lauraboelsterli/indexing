GLOBAL TOP NEWS • China's Xi promises to lower tariffs this year, open economy further Chinese President Xi Jinping promised to open the country's economy further and lower import tariffs on products including cars, in a speech that comes amid rising trade tensions between China and the United States. • FBI raids offices, home of Trump's personal lawyer -sources The Federal Bureau of Investigation on Monday raided the offices and home of U.S. President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen, law enforcement sources said, in a dramatic new development in a series of probes involving close Trump associates. Facebook's Zuckerberg faces Senate hearing but little hope for action Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg's No. 1 mission during his appearance before U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday and Wednesday will be to defend against calls to regulate internet-based companies. LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) • SGX Nifty nearest-month futures at 10,441, up 0.5 percent from its previous close. • The Indian rupee is expected to open higher against the dollar, after Chinese President Xi Jinping’s speech soothed investor anxieties over a trade war between the world’s largest two economies. • Indian government bonds will likely fall in early session ahead of a supply of state government papers, while sentiment remained subdued after a smaller-than-expected increase in foreign investment limit in sovereign debt. The yield on the benchmark 7.17 percent bond maturing in 2028 is likely to trade in a 7.20 percent-7.28 percent band today, a trader with a state-run bank said. GLOBAL MARKETS • Wall Street's major indexes rose on Monday as a softer stance by U.S. policymakers on China tariffs powered a rebound from last week's selloff, but stocks pared much of their gains late in the session after a report that the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided the office of President Donald Trump's lawyer. • U.S stock futures rallied, Asian shares bounced and the safe haven yen fell as Chinese President Xi Jinping promised to lower import tariffs on products including cars this year, helping soothe investor jitters over an escalating U.S.-China trade row. • The dollar sagged against its peers as rhetoric from Chinese and U.S. policymakers kept alive concerns about a trade conflict between the world's two largest economies and undermined support for the greenback. • U.S. Treasury yields on most maturities edged higher on Monday, for the fourth time in the last five sessions, as a recovery of risk appetite accompanied a rally on Wall Street after the United States sought to ease concerns about a trade conflict with China. • Oil markets added to strong gains from the previous session on hopes that a trade dispute between the United States and China could be resolved without greater damage to the global economy. • Gold prices ticked up in early Asian trade as the dollar and Asian stocks slipped, while concerns about the prospect of an escalation in the China-U.S. trade spat and reports of a poison gas attack in Syria offered support as well.
