    "text": "0 COMMENTS Fresenius SE FSNUY -0.86% on Sunday said it is terminating its $4.3 billion agreement to buy generic-drug maker Akorn Inc., AKRX 1.65% but Akorn said it intends to see the deal go through.\nThe deal, struck last April , has been under a shadow since February, when Fresenius said it was looking into possible product-development data breaches at Akorn. \nFresenius on Sunday said Akorn has failed to fulfill several closing conditions of the deal, and that it found material breaches of Food and Drug Administration data-integrity requirements relating to Akorn’s operations during its independent investigation. \nHeard on the Street \nHow Missed Red Flags Derailed a Drug Deal (Feb. 27) The German health-care company said it offered to delay its decision to walk away from the deal to give Akorn more time to complete its own investigation, but that Akorn declined the offer.\nAkorn, however, said it “categorically” disagrees with Fresenius’ claims, and that the investigation isn’t a condition to the deal closing.\nAkorn said the investigation hasn’t found any facts that would result in a material adverse effect on its business, so Fresenius has no basis to terminate the transaction. \n“We intend to vigorously enforce our rights, and Fresenius’ obligations, under our binding merger agreement,” the Lake Forest, Ill., company said.\nShares of Akorn closed Friday at $19.70, about 42% below the $34 a share Fresenius agreed to pay for the company.\nWrite to Colin Kellaher at colin.kellaher@wsj.com",
