    "text": "JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia will keep its export tax for cocoa unchanged at 5 percent in May and will again not charge tax on shipments of crude palm oil, the trade ministry said on Thursday.\nThat will mark the second month with the tax on cocoa at 5 percent as the governmentâ€™s reference price is seen remaining between $2,000 and $2,750 per tonne.\nThe export tax for CPO will be kept at zero for the thirteenth month as prices are seen below a threshold of $750 per tonne.\nReporting by Gayatri Suroyo; Writing by Fransiska Nangoy; Editing by Joseph Radford\n ",
