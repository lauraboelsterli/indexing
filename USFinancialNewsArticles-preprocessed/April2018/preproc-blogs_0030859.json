    "text": "13 COMMENTS LIMA, Peru—A meeting of leaders from across the Americas centered its attention on Venezuela’s authoritarian government, as the U.S. and Latin America’s largest nations said in a session on Saturday they wouldn’t recognize next month’s presidential election, calling it a farce.\nAt the Summit of the Americas, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence called for nations to do more to isolate Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. He traveled to Peru in the place of President Donald Trump. \n“The United States of America will not stand idly by as Venezuela crumbles,” said Mr. Pence, who met with Venezuelan opposition activists in Peru’s capital city. “Now is the time to do more, much more.”\nVenezuela’s economic collapse and perceived growing authoritarianism has loomed over the meeting of presidents from the Western Hemisphere that is held once every three years. Mr. Maduro was barred from participating in the summit, whose official theme is democratic governance against corruption.\nThe U.S., Canada and other countries have leveled sanctions against the Maduro administration over the last year. On Friday, Mr. Pence said the U.S. will provide $16 million in aid to support Venezuelans that have fled abroad amid soaring inflation and chronic shortages of food and medicine.\nAfter Mr. Pence’s speech, leaders from 16 nations in the hemisphere—including Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Peru—issued a statement saying they will continue to push for free and fair elections, the return of democracy and respect for human rights in Venezuela.\n“We can’t look away,” said Argentine President Mauricio Macri, who also signed the statement. “Venezuela is an extreme case of what uncontrolled corruption can lead a society to.”\nMr. Maduro’s few remaining leftist allies in the region lashed out at the U.S., as they have at previous summits. Bolivian President Evo Morales called Washington the “main threat to democracy” in the region, lamenting that Mr. Maduro was excluded from the meeting.\nBut most leaders opposed a regime that has jailed opponents and overseen an economic decline so severe that hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans have flooded into neighboring countries to escape a humanitarian crisis that has resulted in babies dying of malnutrition.\n“Anyone who is a true friend of Venezuela must put the interest of the people of Venezuela to the forefront of our concerns,” said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. “The violation of human rights in Venezuela is completely unacceptable.”\nU.S. Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla), who held meetings with Latin American leaders at the summit, said there is an agreement on the need for countries to impose new, “aggresive sanctions.”\nIn an interview, he said there needs to be a plan to help Venezuela recover once constitutional order is restored. In the meantime, he said the U.S. and its allies are looking to deal with the humanitarian crisis and find a way to deliver humanitarian assistance inside Venezuela.\nMr. Maduro’s Socialist government has blocked foreign aid even as the economy is set to continue its violent decline with inflation hitting 13,000% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. He argues there is no crisis and that aid is part of a U.S.-led effort to destabilize his government.\n“It’s incredible that he maintains a state of denial of such a clear crisis,” Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said Saturday.\nMr. Santos said Colombia won’t recognize the May 20 election in Venezuela that is being boycotted by most of the opposition parties due to a playing field vastly tilted in favor of Mr. Maduro, who has jailed and barred rivals from running. Henri Falcón, a former governor, is Mr. Maduro’s only notable rival candidate.\n“We won’t recognize the results of elections that are designed to cover up a dictatorship,” said Mr. Santos.\nWrite to Ryan Dube at ryan.dube@wsj.com",
