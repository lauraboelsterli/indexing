    "text": "BOULDER, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Zayo Group Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: ZAYO) has acquired a data center in McLean, Virginia. The acquisition, which includes tenants, data center systems, and long-term leases, was driven by strong demand in the Washington, D.C. area for low-latency colocation, interconnection and access to fiber infrastructure.\nThe facility, Zayo’s second colocation facility in Northern Virginia, is located at 1764 Old Meadow Lane and is 62,000 total square feet. Zayo plans to upgrade the critical power at the site to three megawatts (MW) and enhance systems resiliency, security, audit certifications, and network connectivity.\nThe facility, which is on-net to Zayo fiber, will provide a low-latency colocation option for government agencies, web-scale companies, cloud providers and other large enterprises, especially those located in downtown Washington, D.C.
