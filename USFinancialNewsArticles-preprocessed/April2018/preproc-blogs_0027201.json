Follow us on Twitter at @WSJRisk. \nEn+ Group was placed on a U.S. list sanctioning dozens of Russian individuals and entities this month. Reuters Good morning. Russian power-to-aluminum company En+ Group PLC listed on the London Stock Exchange six months ago, cheered on by a former U.K. government minister and a cluster of big name banks. Many lenders now are backing away as the effects of the latest wave of U.S. sanctions sweep across the global finance industry, the Journal’s Max Colchester and Margot Patrick write .\nEn+, its aluminum-producing unit United Co. Rusal and their owner, Oleg Deripaska, were placed April 7 on a list sanctioning dozens of Russian individuals and entities. Banks including Citigroup and Credit Suisse Group AG now are shedding ties to the group, according to people familiar with the matter.\n“This is uncharted territory,” said Tom Cummins, a partner in London at law firm Ashurst.\nCompliance teams are scouring their client lists to work out exposure to subsidiaries and affiliates of the sanctioned groups, some of which have local operations in countries such as Switzerland and Italy, said some bankers.\nBanks have two deadlines, in May and June, to wind down existing business with the sanctioned entities. U.S. officials are touring Europe to warn banks not to flout the sanctions and to cut ties to Russian individuals and entities if they want continued access to U.S. banks.\n“There of course would be consequences for U.K. financial institutions and any activity that is going through the U.S.,” said Sigal Mandelker, U.S. under secretary of the treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence, in a briefing with reporters.\nEXCLUSIVE ON RISK AND COMPLIANCE JOURNAL \nHealth-care firms pay under False Claims Act. A hospital chain and a provider of respiratory equipment each agreed to pay millions of dollars to settle separate allegations brought by whistleblowers, the U.S. Justice Department said Thursday.\nBanner Health , the hospital chain, agreed to pay more than $18 million to settle allegations 12 of its hospitals in Arizona and Colorado knowingly overcharged Medicare patients, admitting them for procedures that could have been handled on an outpatient basis. Banner Health said the settlement doesn’t involve a finding of wrongdoing and it is pleased to resolve the matter and avoid expensive litigation.\nRotech Healthcare Inc. , a Florida-based supplier of respiratory equipment, admitted to billing Medicare for portable oxygen without verifying patients needed the oxygen or that it actually was delivered. Rotech will pay $9.7 million, the department said.\nBoth settlements resulted from suits filed under the False Claims Act. The law allows people who think the government has been defrauded to sue on its behalf and share in whatever money is collected. –Henry Cutter \nSEC awards whistleblower $2.1 million. A former company insider who gave the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission information leading to “multiple successful enforcement actions” will receive more than $2.1 million under a whistleblower-reward program.\nThe agency is legally barred from providing information that might reveal a whistleblower’s identity. Thursday’s award brings total awards issued in the past month to almost $90 million, said Jane Norberg, chief of the SEC’s Office of the Whistleblower. –Henry Cutter \nCrisis-management experts discuss trouble at Uber. Uber Technologies Inc. suspended its driverless-vehicle program last month, two days after a woman in Arizona was killed by a self-driving car. Three experts reviewed Uber’s handling of the matter.\nU.S. sanctions official is moving on. John E. Smith, director of the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, is leaving the position for personal reasons. Mr. Smith is in charge of maintaining and enforcing U.S. sanctions.\nCOMPLIANCE \nTPP nations welcome U.S. interest. Members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal said they were pleased by news that the U.S. was looking at rejoining the agreement, but that they opposed renegotiating the pact, Bloomberg reports.\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, seen here during an Upper House committee session in Tokyo this month, has repeatedly advocated the Trans-Pacific Partnership with President Donald Trump. PHOTO: ZUMA PRESS Backpage.com, CEO plead guilty. Carl Ferrer, the chief executive of Backpage.com , a website authorities have dubbed an “online brothel,” pleaded guilty Thursday to state and federal charges including conspiracy and money laundering. The company pleaded guilty to human trafficking, the AP reports.\nFormer telecom executive is arrested. Elizabeth Ann Pierce, former chief executive of the Alaska telecommunications company Quintillion Networks LLC , has been arrested after prosecutors accused her of forging contracts to induce firms to make more than $250 million in investments. An attorney for Ms. Pierce couldn’t immediately be reached, the WSJ reports.\nDATA SECURITY \nBitcoin is missing at Indian exchange. Indian cryptocurrency exchange Coinsecure said some $3 million in bitcoin has gone missing from a digital wallet for users’ funds. It accused a top official, Amitabh Saxena, of involvement. Attempts to contact Mr. Saxena were unsuccessful, the WSJ reports.\nInogen reveals data breach. Inogen ., a maker of medical devices, said nonpublic financial information and personal data belonging to rental customers was accessed during a data breach, Reuters reports. Payment-card data and medical records weren’t affected.\nGOVERNANCE \nTycoon to stand down at casino firm. Stanley Ho, who transformed Macau into the world’s biggest casino hub, is to retire from his flagship company, SJM Holdings , after more than 50 years at the helm. He will retire as chairman and executive director in June. Mr. Ho stepped back from day-to-day operations several years ago, the WSJ reports.\nREPUTATION \nTesla, NTSB clash over probe. An unusual public feud between Tesla and federal accident investigators escalated over the examination of a fatal car crash, sidelining the auto maker from an official probe concerning its semiautonomous driving system, the WSJ reports.\nRISK \nTrump orders review of postal service’s finances. President Donald Trump ordered the creation of a task force to recommend reforms in the U.S. Postal Service, following weeks of tweets accusing the agency of giving a sweetheart deal to Amazon Inc. for package delivery. A Postal Service spokesman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, the WSJ reports.\nOPERATIONS \nMississippi shuts down bridges. The state of Mississippi’s bridges are in such bad shape that the governor has ordered at least 102 closed this week. Gov. Phil Bryant issued an emergency declaration, authorizing state Department of Transportation workers to shut down the bridges, with the help of state troopers, if necessary, the WSJ reports.\nSTRATEGY \nZillow to buy, flip homes. Real-estate listings company Zillow Group is getting into the business of buying and flipping homes, a new venture that could disrupt the traditional brokerage business. Zillow will buy homes in Las Vegas and Phoenix, renovate them and aim to flip them within 90 days, the WSJ reports.\nVolkswagen’s new chief to examine asset sales. Herbert Diess, the new chief executive officer at Volkswagen , will consider selling assets. He said he wants to transform the auto maker into a slimmer firm with strong brands, Reuters reports.\nTrucking companies push into ‘last mile’. Trucking companies hope to cash in on home delivery of bulky items as consumers shop online for goods too big for parcel networks. Ryder System paid $120 million this month to buy MXD Group , a specialist in “final mile” delivery, the WSJ reports.\nXPO Logistics holds the biggest share of the market for “non-conveyable goods home delivery,” with 9% of the business, according to consulting firm Simon-Kucher & Partners.
