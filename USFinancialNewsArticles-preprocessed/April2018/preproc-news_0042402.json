    "text": "BUDAPEST, April 18 (Reuters) - Hungary’s economy needs faster growth in lending to sustain its expansion, central bank deputy governor Marton Nagy said on Wednesday.\nNagy told a conference that corporate lending growth could rise to an annual 10-15 percent, while growth in household lending should be even faster, and this should go together with a rise in wages.\n“Lending, incomes and investments must rise in tandem, all three are necessary ... for sustainable convergence,” Nagy said, projecting a lending boom for the next 12 years.
