Scandal-hit Facebook which is set to report after market on Wednesday, was down 0.14 percent.\nThe CBOE Volatility index, a gauge of short-term stock market volatility jumped to more than 1-week high to 18.69 points.\nAt 11:28 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 32.58 points, or 0.14 percent, at 23,991.55, the S&P 500 was down 1.31 points, or 0.05 percent, at 2,633.25 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 12.49 points, or 0.18 percent, at 7,019.84.\nReuters data shows that analysts are now estimating 22 percent profit growth in the first quarter among the S&P 500 companies, compared with 18.6 percent at the start of the earnings season.\nComcast rose 3.7 percent after the U.S. cable company submitted a $31 billion offer for pay-TV group Sky , challenging an already agreed but lower takeover bid from Rupert Murdoch’s Fox.
