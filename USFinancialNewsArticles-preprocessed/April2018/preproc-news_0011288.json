The offer is below Viacom's current market valuation of $12.5 billion. on.wsj.com/2q3mSBS\n- Tesla Inc said it produced 2,020 Model 3 cars in the past seven days—which includes two days in April—missing its goal of making 2,500 vehicles a week by the end of March. on.wsj.com/2q5cZn3\n- Spotify Technology SA surged on the first day of trading, closing at $149.01 and giving the company a market value of $26.54 billion, cutting a new path to public ownership that could alter the way companies think about the listing process and pose a new threat to a core business on Wall Street. on.wsj.com/2uHGH7q\nCompiled by Bengaluru newsroom\n ",
