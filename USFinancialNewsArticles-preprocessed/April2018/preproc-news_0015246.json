    "text": "HOUSTON (Reuters) - Motiva Enterprises [MOTIV.UL] is studying an expansion of its Port Arthur, Texas, refinery to more than double its current 603,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) crude oil processing capacity, Motiva Chief Executive Brian Coffman said on Saturday.\nThe company is considering boosting the refinery’s capacity to between 1 million and 1.5 million bpd, Coffman said. The Motiva Port Arthur refinery is currently the country’s largest in capacity.\nThe 1.2-million bpd Reliance Industries refinery in Jamnagar, India, has the world’s largest crude oil processing capacity.\n“That’s something we’re evaluating, we’re studying for in the future,” he said at a Saudi Aramco event in Houston on Saturday.\nSaudi Aramco is the parent company of Motiva.\nReporting by Erwin Seba, editing by G Crosse\n ",
