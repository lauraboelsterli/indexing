    "text": "381 COMMENTS WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he had decided not to get “involved” with the Justice Department investigation of his associates’ alleged ties to Russia and business dealings—for now.\n“I’m very disappointed in my Justice Department. I have decided I won’t be involved,” Mr. Trump said in an interview on Fox News. He added: “I may change my mind at some point.”\nDuring his time in office, Mr. Trump has publicly criticized senior officials in the Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation over the probe of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, and earlier this month privately mulled taking steps to remove some of them.\nIn the Fox News interview, Mr. Trump lashed out again at the FBI: “You look at the corruption at the top of the FBI, it’s a disgrace, and our Justice Department—which I try to stay away from, but at some point, I won’t—our Justice Department should be looking at that kind of stuff.”\nWSJ's Shelby Holliday looks at whether \"executive privilege\" can protect Trump allies from speaking to Congress and Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Photo Illustration: Drew Evans/The Wall Street Journal. The president called the Russia investigation a “cloud over my head.”\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller, who was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein last year, is investigating whether Trump associates colluded with Russia ’s efforts to interfere in the election, and whether the president sought to obstruct justice by firing then-FBI director James Comey last spring, while the agency’s investigation was under way. Mr. Trump has denied collusion and obstruction, and Moscow has denied election meddling.\nMr. Mueller’s team of investigators and prosecutors has secured guilty pleas from two Trump campaign aides, his former national security adviser , Michael Flynn, and several others. Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, has pleaded not guilty to tax, bank fraud and other charges filed by Mr. Mueller’s team.\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself from the Russia investigation early on in Mr. Trump’s term, on Thursday criticized how long Mr. Mueller is taking with his investigation. Mr. Sessions was appearing before the House Appropriations Committee on the same day a Senate panel voted overwhelmingly to approve a bill protecting Mr. Mueller from being fired without cause.\n“This thing needs to conclude,” Mr. Sessions said.\nHe also cited changes in the leadership of the FBI in response to Republican concerns about allegations of bias and misconduct, noting that the agency has a new director, deputy director and legal counsel, among other posts.\nNewsletter Sign-up “We’ve got to be careful we don’t smear everybody, if somebody made some errors,” Mr. Sessions said of the FBI.\nSome Republican lawmakers have criticized Mr. Sessions for declining to appoint a second special counsel to examine the Justice Department’s investigations of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump’s Democratic rival for the presidency, and other matters.\nMr. Sessions defended that decision. “I do not think we need to willy-nilly appoint special counsels,” he said. “As we can see, it can really take on a life of its own.”\nIn the Senate on Thursday, the Russia investigation won a show of bipartisan support from the Judiciary Committee, where four Republicans joined all the panel’s Democrats to approve a bill that would enshrine into law a Justice Department guideline that a special counsel can’t be fired without cause. The measure would also give special counsels a 10-day window to challenge a dismissal in federal court.\nThe bill is the first major congressional activity to protect Mr. Mueller’s probe, but there is limited appetite for it among Republican leadership. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he doesn’t plan to bring it to the floor for a vote. Even if the proposed legislation could attract bipartisan support in the House and Senate, it would still face a likely presidential veto.\nMr. Trump’s comments Thursday followed weeks of frustration over the Russia probe following the FBI’s search of the home and office of longtime Trump lawyer Michael Cohen earlier this month. The raid was part of an investigation by federal prosecutors in New York, after a referral by the special counsel, into possible bank fraud and campaign-finance violations by Mr. Cohen.\nEarlier this month, Mr. Trump told associates he was considering dismissing Mr. Rosenstein and Mr. Mueller himself, according to people familiar with the matter. His frustration has since subsided .\nAn administration official described Mr. Trump’s Fox News interview Thursday morning as a venting opportunity for the president, whose aides have sought to restrict how often he calls in to TV shows—a frequent habit of his during his campaign. “He just had a lot to get off his chest,” the official said.\nMr. Trump also appeared to reverse previous statements about his knowledge of a payment Mr. Cohen made in October 2016 to adult film star Stephanie Clifford, professionally known as Stormy Daniels, in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Mr. Trump a decade earlier.\nAsked about the extent of Mr. Cohen’s work for him, Mr. Trump said Thursday: “He represents me, like with this crazy Stormy Daniels deal. He represented me.” He then added, “There were no campaign funds going into it.”\nThat appeared to conflict with Mr. Trump’s previous assertions that he had no knowledge of the payment by Mr. Cohen to Ms. Clifford or where the money came from.\nWrite to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com and Aruna Viswanatha at Aruna.Viswanatha@wsj.com",
