(\"xG\" or the \"Company\") (Nasdaq: XGTI, XGTIW), a leading provider of wireless video solutions to broadcast, law enforcement and defense markets, and private mobile broadband networks for critical communications, announced today that George Schmitt has elected to retire from his roles as CEO and Executive Chairman, effective immediately. The Board of Directors has appointed current xG Technology board member Gary Cuccio as Executive Chairman and interim CEO. As part of its leadership succession plan, the Board was already in discussions with potential candidates for the permanent CEO role, and has initiated a formal search for a new permanent CEO. The search is expected to take no longer than 90 days.\n\"Having successfully overseen the acquisition of IMT and Vislink, and their integration into xG Technology's operations, I have decided that it is now appropriate to transition the leadership of the Company during its next phase of growth,\" said Mr. Schmitt. \"It has been a privilege to lead the dedicated employees of all our businesses, and I want to thank them all for their hard work in successfully unifying our Companies. I would be remiss if I did not also thank our investors, many of whom have been with us for a number of years and whose support we appreciate. Under new leadership the company will thrive and grow, and that will serve us all well. Lastly, thanks to our Board of Directors for helping us navigate through challenging times while we transformed our business and positioned it for an exciting future.\"\nGary Cuccio said, \"On behalf of the Board and all xG Technology employees, I want to thank George Schmitt for his years of dedication and service to the Company.
