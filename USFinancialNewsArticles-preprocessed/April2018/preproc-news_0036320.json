    "text": "LONDON, April 12 (Reuters) - Base metals miner Central Asia Metals (CAML) reported a 35 percent rise in 2017 core earnings as copper prices improved, allowing it to raise its dividend.\nThe London-listed miner said earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBIDTA) in 2017 reached $53.8 million, up from $39.9 million a year ago.\nThe miner bought the SASA mine in Macedonia in September for $402.5 million, which was funded through a combination of debt and equity.\nCAML, which mines mainly copper, zinc and lead, reported that net debt jumped to $138.9 million from no debt and net cash of $40.3 million last year.\nCAML proposed a final dividend of 10 pence, taking 2017 total payout to 16.5 cents from 15.5 cents a year ago.\nReporting by Zandi Shabalala; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ",
