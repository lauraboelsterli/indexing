FILE PHOTO: A Norwegian Air Boeing 737-800 is seen during the presentation of Norwegian Air first low cost transatlantic flight service from Argentina at Ezeiza airport in Buenos Aires, Argentina, March 8, 2018. REUTERS/Marcos Brindicci/File Photo \nThe value of the stock rose by almost 50 percent on Thursday when IAG ( ICAG.L ), the owner of BA and several other airlines, said it had bought a stake in Norwegian and would consider making a bid. \n“I have not at all thought of selling,” Bjoern Kjos told reporters, while adding it was flattering that IAG was showing interest in Norwegian. Kjos controls about a quarter of the company’s shares. Reporting by Joachim Dagenborg, writing by Terje Solsvik, editing by Ole Petter Skonnord",
