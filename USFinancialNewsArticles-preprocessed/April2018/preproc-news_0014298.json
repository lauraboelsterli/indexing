    "text": "Nvidia's dominant positions in the artificial intelligence and gaming markets are unmatched, according to Morgan Stanley.\nThe bank raised its rating for Nvidia's shares to overweight from equal-weight, predicting the chipmaker will report profits above expectations in its fiscal 2019.\n\"In addition to longer-term data investment trends, we see shorter-term drivers in gaming offsetting crypto weakness, and progress in data center inference [machine learning] expanding the long-term opportunity,\" analyst Joseph Moore wrote in a note to clients.\nMoore reiterated his $258 price target for Nvidia shares, representing 20 percent upside from Monday's close.\nThe analyst estimates Nvidia will generate fiscal 2019 earnings-per-share of $6.76 versus the Wall Street consensus of $6.27.\nNvidia shares are up 120 percent over the past 12 months through Monday compared to the S&P 500's 11 percent gain.\n\"We now believe that developments in hardware and software have positioned NVIDIA to capture a higher portion of Inference, key to the long term growth rate,\" he wrote. \"Strength in gaming titles, and a new NVIDIA product cycle, should drive growth while minimizing the negative impact of cryptocurrency mining economics moving to zero.\"\nThe company's stock rose 5 percent Tuesday after the report.\n— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this story.\nDisclaimer",
