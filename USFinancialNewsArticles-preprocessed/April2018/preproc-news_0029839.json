    "text": "Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson told ABC News on Monday that it was \"completely inappropriate\" for Philadelphia Starbucks employees to call the police on two black men who asked to use the restroom.\nJohnson was asked by \"Good Morning America\" if he thought Thursday's arrests were a case of \"racial profiling.\" He did not directly answer that question, but he did say: \"Starbucks was built as a company that creates a warm, welcoming environment for all customers. That didn't happen here in this case.\"",
