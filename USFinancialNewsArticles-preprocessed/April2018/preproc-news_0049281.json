undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities and earnings per share are computed independently for each period. Accordingly, the sum of each quarterly amount may not agree to the year-to-date total. We also provide adjusted diluted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP measure. See \"Table 15: Calculation of Regulatory Capital Measures and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\" for additional information on our non-GAAP measures.\n(3)\nTangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP measure calculated based on tangible common equity divided by common shares outstanding. See \"Table 15: Calculation of Regulatory Capital Measures and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\" for additional information on non-GAAP measures.\n(4)\nIncluded in loans held for investment are purchased credit-impaired loans (\"PCI loans\") recorded at fair value at acquisition and subsequently accounted for based on estimated cash flows expected to be collected over the life of the loans (under the accounting standard formerly known as \"SOP 03-3,\" or Accounting Standards Codification 310-30).

See \"Table 15: Calculation of Regulatory Capital Measures and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\" for additional information on non-GAAP measures.\n(8)\nReturn on average common equity is calculated based on annualized (i) income from continuing operations, net of tax; (ii) less dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities; (iii) less preferred stock dividends, for the period, divided by average common equity for the period. Our calculation of return on average common equity may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.\n(9)\nReturn on average tangible common equity (\"ROTCE\") is a non-GAAP measure calculated based on annualized (i) income from continuing operations, net of tax; (ii) less dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities; (iii) less preferred stock dividends, for the period, divided by average tangible common equity for the period. Our calculation of ROTCE may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. See \"Table 15: Calculation of Regulatory Capital Measures and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\" for additional information on non-GAAP measures.\n(10)\nEfficiency ratio is calculated based on total non-interest expense for the period divided by total net revenue for the period. We also provide an adjusted efficiency ratio, which is a non-GAAP measure. See \"Table 15: Calculation of Regulatory Capital Measures and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\" for additional information on our non-GAAP measures.\n(11)\nNet charge-off rate is calculated based on annualized net charge-offs for the period divided by average loans held for investment for the period.\n(12)\nCapital ratios as of the end of Q1 2018 are preliminary and therefore subject to change. See \"Table 15: Calculation of Regulatory Capital Measures and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\" for information on the calculation of each of these ratios.\n(13)\nTCE ratio is a non-GAAP measure calculated based on TCE divided by tangible assets.

Allowance and Business Segment Disclosures (Tables 7—13)\n(1)\nNonperforming loan rates are calculated based on nonperforming loans for each category divided by period-end total loans held for investment for each respective category.\n(2)\nNonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans, real estate owned (\"REO\") and other foreclosed assets. The total nonperforming asset rate is calculated based on total nonperforming assets divided by the combined period-end total loans held for investment, REO and other foreclosed assets.\n(3)\nPrimarily consists of the legacy loan portfolio of our discontinued GreenPoint mortgage operations.\n(4)\nRepresents foreign currency translation adjustments and the net impact of loan transfers and sales where applicable.\n(5)\nCharges for the impacts of the Tax Act of $1.77 billion are reflected in the Other category of our business segment results for Q4 2017. This amount is a reasonable estimate as of December 31, 2017, which may be adjusted during the measurement period ending no later than December 2018. The Tax Act refers to the Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on budget for fiscal year 2018 enacted on December 22, 2017.\n(6)\nSome of our commercial investments generate tax-exempt income, tax credits or other tax benefits. Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking revenue and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory tax rate (21% and 35% for all periods in 2017) and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category.\n(7)\nIn the first quarter of 2018, we made a change in how revenue is measured in our Commercial Banking business to include the tax benefits of losses on certain investments. These tax benefits are included in revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis within our Commercial Banking business, with an offsetting reduction to the Other category. In addition, all revenue presented on a taxable-equivalent basis in our Commercial Banking business was impacted by the reduction of the federal tax rate set forth in the Tax Act. The net impact of the measurement change and the reduction of the federal tax rate was a decrease of $28 million in revenue in our Commercial Banking business , with an offsetting impact to the Other category.\n(8)\nAverage yield on loans held for investment is calculated based on annualized interest income for the period divided by average loans held for investment during the period for the respective loan category. Annualized interest income is computed based on the effective yield of the respective loan category and does not include any allocations, such as funds transfer pricing.\n(9)\nTotal net revenue margin is calculated based on annualized total net revenue for the period divided by average loans held for investment during the period for the respective loan category.\n(10)\nPurchase volume consists of purchase transactions, net of returns, for the period, and excludes cash advance and balance transfer transactions.\n(11)\nPercentages represent period-end loans held for investment in each credit score category. Domestic card credit scores generally represent FICO scores. These scores are obtained from one of the major credit bureaus at origination and are refreshed monthly thereafter. We approximate non-FICO credit scores to comparable FICO scores for consistency purposes. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 660 or below category.\n(12)\nPercentages represent period-end loans held for investment in each credit score category. Auto credit scores generally represent average FICO scores obtained from three credit bureaus at the time of application and are not refreshed thereafter. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 620 or below category.\n(13)\nCriticized exposures correspond to the \"Special Mention,\" \"Substandard\" and \"Doubtful\" asset categories defined by bank regulatory authorities.\n(14)\nIncludes charges incurred as a result of restructuring activities.\n**\nNot meaningful.\nCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION (COF)\nTable 15: Calculation of Regulatory Capital Measures and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures (1)\nBasel III Standardized Approach\n(Dollars in millions, except as noted)\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nSeptember 30,\n2017\nJune 30,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2017\nRegulatory Capital Metrics\nCommon equity excluding AOCI\n$\n46,441\n$\n45,296\n$\n46,415\n$\n45,459\n$\n44,614\nAdjustments:\nAOCI (2)(3)\n(1,599)\n(808)\n(538)\n(593)\n(807)\nGoodwill, net of related deferred tax liabilities\n(14,379)\n(14,380)\n(14,300)\n(14,299)\n(14,302)\nIntangible assets, net of related deferred tax liabilities (3)\n(371)\n(330)\n(372)\n(419)\n(465)\nOther\n620\n258\n93\n78\n121\nCommon equity Tier 1 capital\n$\n30,712\n$\n30,036\n$\n31,298\n$\n30,226\n$\n29,161\nTier 1 capital\n$\n35,073\n$\n34,396\n$\n35,657\n$\n34,585\n$\n33,519\nTotal capital (4)\n42,264\n41,962\n43,272\n42,101\n40,979\nRisk-weighted assets\n291,352\n292,225\n292,041\n283,231\n279,302\nAdjusted average assets (5)\n347,287\n348,424\n340,579\n335,248\n336,990\nCapital Ratios\nCommon equity Tier 1 capital (6)\n10.5\n%\n10.3\n%\n10.7\n%\n10.7\n%\n10.4\n%\nTier 1 capital (7)\n12.0\n11.8\n12.2\n12.2\n12.0\nTotal capital (8)\n14.5\n14.4\n14.8\n14.9\n14.7\nTier 1 leverage (5)\n10.1\n9.9\n10.5\n10.3\n9.9\nTangible common equity (\"TCE\") (9)\n8.6\n8.3\n8.8\n8.8\n8.5\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\nThe following non-GAAP measures consist of our adjusted results that we believe help investors and users of our financial information understand the effect of adjusting items on our selected reported results and provide alternate measurements of our performance.
