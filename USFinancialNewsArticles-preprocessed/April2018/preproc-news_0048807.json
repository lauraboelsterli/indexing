Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.65 compared to $2.48 in the year-ago quarter, a 6.9 percent increase.\n\"General Dynamics delivered solid first-quarter results, with growth in revenue, net earnings and EPS,\" said Phebe Novakovic, chairman and chief executive officer of General Dynamics. \"This is a strong start to 2018 and we remain confident in our outlook.\"\nMargin\nCompany-wide operating margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 13.4 percent, compared to 14.1 percent in first-quarter 2017. Consolidated operating margin was up 60 basis points, compared to 12.8 percent in fourth-quarter 2017.\nCapital Deployment\nThe company repurchased 1.2 million of its outstanding shares in the first quarter.

The 10.7 percent increase is consistent with increases over the past five years.\nBacklog\nGeneral Dynamics' total backlog at the end of first-quarter 2018 was $62.1 billion. The estimated potential contract value, representing management's estimate of value in unfunded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts and unexercised options, was $25.5 billion. Total potential contract value, the sum of all backlog components, was $87.6 billion at the end of the quarter.\nThere was order activity across the Gulfstream product portfolio and strong demand for defense products. Significant awards in the quarter include a contract with a total potential value of $1 billion to deliver Piranha 5 wheeled armored vehicles to the Romanian Armed Forces, $695 million from the U.S. Navy for long-lead materials for Block V Virginia-class submarines, $420 million from the Navy for a second John Lewis-class ship, $355 million from the U.S. Army for continued production and support of Stryker vehicles and $215 million from NASA for the Space Network Ground Segment Sustainment project to modernize NASA's ground infrastructure systems for its satellite network.\nAbout General Dynamics\nHeadquartered in Falls Church, Virginia, General Dynamics is a global aerospace and defense company that offers a broad portfolio of products and services in business aviation; combat vehicles, weapons systems and munitions; C4ISR and IT solutions; and shipbuilding and ship repair.
