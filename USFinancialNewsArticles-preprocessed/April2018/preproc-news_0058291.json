    "text": "DALLAS, April 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Westwood Holdings Group, Inc. (NYSE:WHG) today reported first quarter 2018 earnings. Highlights from the quarter include:\nRevenues of $33.6 million increased $1.0 million from the first quarter of 2017. Current quarter revenues include $1.3 million of performance-based fees compared to $0.4 million in the prior year quarter.\nAll of our U.S. value and multi-asset strategies outperformed their primary benchmarks for the quarter.\nTop quartile performance was achieved by our SmallCap Value, SMidCap Plus, SMidCap Value and LargeCap Value teams.\nWe closed on the sale of our Omaha-based Private Wealth operations, received net proceeds of $10.0 million and recognized a $0.5 million gain on sale.\nAt quarter-end, Westwood had $100.5 million in cash and investments, stockholders’ equity of $156.0 million, and no debt.\nFirst quarter 2018 revenues of $33.6 million compared to $32.6 million in the first quarter of 2017 and $33.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase from the prior year quarter primarily related to performance-based fees of $1.3 million earned in the current quarter. The decrease from the immediately preceding quarter was primarily due to net outflows.\nAssets under management at March 31, 2018 totaled $22.6 billion, compared to $22.1 billion and $24.2 billion at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nFirst quarter net income of $8.0 million compared with $6.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase primarily related to higher revenues and a $0.9 million foreign currency transaction gain, net of tax, recorded in the current quarter. Diluted earnings per share of $0.93 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.73 in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP Economic Earnings increased from $10.6 million, or $1.28 per share, in 2017's first quarter, to $12.6 million, or $1.48 per share, in the first quarter of 2018.\nFirst quarter net income of $8.0 million compared with $2.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase was driven primarily by a $3.4 million incremental income tax expense recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the tax reform enacted in December 2017, as well as the current quarter foreign currency transaction gain noted above. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter of $0.93 compared to $0.34 for the fourth quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP Economic Earnings of $12.6 million, or $1.48 per share, compared to $7.6 million, or $0.89 per share, in the immediately preceding quarter.\nBrian Casey, Westwood’s President & CEO, commented, \"The first quarter saw a return to volatility as worldwide politics took center stage. We were pleased to see the benefits of active management on display as all of our U.S. Value and multi-asset products outperformed their primary passive benchmarks. We believe that continued political uncertainty and interest rate fears will lead to higher volatility and provide more opportunities for active managers with disciplined investment processes to outperform passive strategies.\"\nWestwood’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.68 per common share, payable on July 2, 2018 to stockholders of record on June 8, 2018.\nEconomic Earnings and Economic Earnings per Share (\"Economic EPS\") are non-GAAP performance measures and are explained and reconciled with the most comparable GAAP numbers in the attached tables.\nWestwood will host a conference call to discuss first quarter 2018 results and other business matters at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time today.

We provide these measures in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income and earnings per share, which are reported on a GAAP basis. Management reviews Economic Earnings and Economic EPS to evaluate Westwood’s ongoing performance, allocate resources, and review our dividend policy. We believe that these non-GAAP performance measures, while not substitutes for GAAP net income or earnings per share, are useful for management and investors when evaluating Westwood’s underlying operating and financial performance and its available resources. We do not advocate that investors consider these non-GAAP measures without also considering financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nWe define Economic Earnings as net income plus non-cash equity-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, and deferred taxes related to goodwill. Although depreciation on fixed assets is a non-cash expense, we do not add it back when calculating Economic Earnings because depreciation charges represent an allocation of the decline in the value of the related assets that will ultimately require replacement. In addition, we do not adjust Economic Earnings for tax deductions related to restricted stock expense or amortization of intangible assets. Economic EPS represents Economic Earnings divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding.\nSource:Westwood Holdings Group Inc",
