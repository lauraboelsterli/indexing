    "text": "If you use Twitter, the company knows a lot about you.\nIt knows where you've been, the advertisers you're interested in and more. We're going to show you how to find out what it knows, download that information.\nIt's important to understand what social media companies know about you, particularly in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica and Facebook data leak, where political data research firm Cambridge Analytica obtained information on more than 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge or Facebook's authorization.\nAfter some digging, I discovered that Twitter knows:\nWhat devices I use Twitter on When and where I was when I tweeted The advertising topics I'm interested in Hundreds of applications I've downloaded on my smartphone Every tweet I've ever posted Finding everything Twitter knows about you is easy.

Depending on its permissions, an authorized application may be able to use your account in various ways, including reading your Tweets, seeing who you follow, updating your profile, posting Tweets on your behalf, accessing your Direct Messages, or seeing your email address.\"\nThere are also contacts uploaded from my phone, which I never knew I did: (The same thing happened to me with Facebook , by the way.)\nDownload a copy of your Tweets and data: At the bottom of the page, select \"Request your data.\" It takes a couple of hours and may end up in your Spam folder. For me, I found this was most valuable for seeing every Tweet I'd ever posted, all the way back to the day I joined in 2007. Look at them all:\nWant to dig deeper?
