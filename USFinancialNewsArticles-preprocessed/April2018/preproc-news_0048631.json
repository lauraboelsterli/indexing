    "text": "TOKYO, Japan’s Nikkei share average fell on Monday as index heavyweight stocks such as SoftBank and Terumo lost ground, offsetting gains in financials, which rallied after U.S. yields rose.\nThe Nikkei ended down 0.3 percent at 22,088.04 points.\nMedical equipment maker Terumo Corp tumbled 3.9 percent and SoftBank shed 1.2 percent, collectively knocking nearly 30 points off the Nikkei.\nApple suppliers were sold after Morgan Stanley forecast weak demand for the tech giant’s latest iPhones, a day after Taiwan Semiconductor raised fears of softer smartphone sales.\nMurata Manufacturing declined 1.3 percent and TDK Corp dropped 2.0 percent.\nFinancial stocks, which invest in foreign bonds, outperformed following a rise in U.S. yields, with insurers T&D Holdings up 4.2 percent, Dai-ichi Life surging 4.0 percent and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group 2.0 percent higher.\nThe broader Topix was flat at 1,750.79.\nReporting by Ayai Tomisawa; Editing by Kim Coghill\n ",
