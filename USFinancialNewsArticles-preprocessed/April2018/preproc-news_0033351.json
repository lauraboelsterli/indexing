    "text": "April 18, 2018 / 1:16 AM / Updated 29 minutes ago Rugby-Weber first top-level player to condemn Folau's comments Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nWELLINGTON, April 18 (Reuters) - One test All Blacks scrumhalf Brad Weber has become the first top-level rugby player to condemn anti-gay comments made by Israel Folau, stating they “disgust” him. \nFolau, who is an Evangelical Christian, created a firestorm of controversy in Australia, and in rugby circles, after he wrote on his Instagram page that gays would be condemned to “hell” if they failed to “repent”. \nHis comments were described as “very disappointing” by Qantas airlines, a major sponsor of Rugby Australia, while international referee Nigel Owens, who came out as gay in 2007, said such comments could contribute to young people taking their own lives. \nWeber, who played his only test for the All Blacks in 2015 and is likely to be in contention this year, said he was disappointed that players had stayed silent. \n“Kinda sick of us players staying quiet on some of this stuff,” Weber wrote on Twitter. “I can’t stand that I have to play this game that I love with people, like Folau, who say what he’s saying. \n“My cousin and her partner, and my Aunty and her partner are some of the most kind, caring & loving people I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. \n“To think that I play against someone that says they’ll go to Hell for being gay disgusts me.” \nWeber’s stance has drawn widespread praise in local media, with a column in the New Zealand Herald labelling him a “modern-day rugby hero”, while rugby columnist Paul Cully wrote on Fairfax Media’s Stuff website it was Weber’s “...biggest tackle, bringing down Israel Folau” over the comments. \n“He has stood up for his whanau (family) and all New Zealanders, and may have just changed the game when it comes to rugby players talking about social issues,” wrote Cully. \n“He did not have to. In fact, there must have been a voice in his head telling him to keep his head down. \n“But, gloriously, Weber deviated from this path and acted like a human.” Reporting by Greg Stutchbury; Editing by Peter Rutherford",
