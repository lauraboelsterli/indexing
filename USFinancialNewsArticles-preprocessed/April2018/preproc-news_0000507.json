FILE PHOTO: A woman stands on a seaside promenade against the background of pre-monsoon clouds gathered over the Arabian Sea in Kochi, India, May 15, 2017. REUTERS/Sivaram V \nMonsoon rains are expected to be 100 percent of the long-term average, Skymet said in a Tweet. \nIndia defines average, or normal, rainfall as between 96 percent and 104 percent of a 50-year average of 89 cm for the entire four-month season beginning June. \nThe state-run India Meteorological Department will come out with its monsoon forecast in mid-April.
