    "text": "MILAN (Reuters) - Italian private broadcaster Mediaset ( MS.MI ) is not interested in buying the TV broadcasting rights for the next three seasons of Serie A matches from Spain’s Mediapro, following its deal with Sky ( SKYB.L ), a source said on Tuesday.\nOn Friday the Milan-based TV group signed an agreement to air its pay-TV Cinema and TV series channels on Sky Italia’s satellite while Sky will be able to offer customers its own services on Mediaset’s digital platform.\nIn February, Spanish broker Mediapro bought the rights to broadcast top flight Serie A soccer matches for 2018-2021 at 1.05 billion euros per season and must sell the rights to other entities.\nThe group was expected to start talks with both Mediaset and Sky in coming days for the sale.\nMediaset was not immediately available for comment.\nReporting by Elvira Pollina , writing by Giulia Segreti\n ",
