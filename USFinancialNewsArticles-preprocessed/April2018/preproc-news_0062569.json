    "text": "LOS ANGELES, April 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Mercury General Corporation (NYSE: MCY) reported today for the first quarter of 2018:\nConsolidated Highlights\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nChange\n2018\n2017\n$\n%\n(000's except per-share amounts and ratios)\nNet premiums earned\n$\n808,084\n$\n789,770\n$\n18,314\n2.3\nNet premiums written (1)\n$\n861,267\n$\n811,594\n$\n49,673\n6.1\nNet (loss) income\n$\n(42,607)\n$\n26,980\n$\n(69,587)\n(257.9)\nNet (loss) income per diluted share\n$\n(0.77)\n$\n0.49\n$\n(1.26)\n(257.1)\nOperating income (1)\n$\n3,794\n$\n11,081\n$\n(7,287)\n(65.8)\nOperating income per diluted share (1)\n$\n0.07\n$\n0.20\n$\n(0.13)\n(65.0)\nCatastrophe losses (2)\n$\n9,000\n$\n30,000\n$\n(21,000)\n(70.0)\nCombined ratio (3)\n103.8\n%\n103.1\n%\nâ€”\n0.7 pts\n(1)\nThese measures are not based on U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), are defined in \"Information Regarding GAAP and Non-GAAP Measures\" and are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in \"Supplemental Schedules.\"\n(2)\nThe 2018 catastrophe losses were primarily attributable to winter storms and mudslides in California and winter storms in the states along the Atlantic Seaboard. The 2017 catastrophe losses were primarily due to severe rainstorms in California.\n(3)\nThe Company experienced unfavorable development of approximately $43 million and $4 million on prior accident years' loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The majority of the unfavorable development in 2018 was attributable to higher than estimated California automobile losses resulting from severity in excess of expectations for bodily injury claims, while the majority of the unfavorable development in 2017 was attributable to higher than estimated California property losses.\nInvestment Results\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n(000's except average annual yield)\nAverage invested assets at cost (1)\n$\n3,629,913\n$\n3,502,870\nNet investment income (2)\nBefore income taxes\n$\n31,510\n$\n31,169\nAfter income taxes\n$\n28,396\n$\n27,319\nAverage annual yield on investments - after income taxes (2)\n3.1\n%\n3.1\n%\n(1)\nFixed maturities and short-term bonds at amortized cost; equities and other short-term investments at cost. Average invested assets at cost are based on the monthly amortized cost of the invested assets for each period.\n(2)\nNet investment income before and after income taxes increased slightly due to higher average invested assets. Average annual yield on investments after income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2018 benefited modestly from the lower tax rate effective January 1, 2018 applied to the taxable investment income.\nThe Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.6250 per share. The dividend will be paid on June 28, 2018 to shareholders of record on June 14, 2018.\nMercury General Corporation and its subsidiaries are a multiple line insurance organization offering predominantly personal automobile and homeowners insurance through a network of independent producers in many states.

These measures are not intended to replace, and should be read in conjunction with, the GAAP financial results.\nNet income is the GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to operating income. Operating income is net income excluding realized investment gains and losses, net of tax. Operating income is used by management along with the other components of net income to assess the Company's performance. Management uses operating income as an important measure to evaluate the results of the Company's insurance business. Management believes that operating income provides investors with a valuable measure of the Company's ongoing performance as it reveals trends in the Company's insurance business that may be obscured by the effect of net realized investment gains and losses. Realized investment gains and losses may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by external economic developments such as capital market conditions. Accordingly, operating income highlights the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of the Company's core insurance business. Operating income, which is provided as supplemental information and should not be considered as a substitute for net income, does not reflect the overall profitability of the Company's business. It should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial results. See \"Supplemental Schedules\" above for a reconciliation of net income to operating income.\nNet premiums earned , the most directly comparable GAAP measure to net premiums written, represents the portion of premiums written that is recognized as revenue in the financial statements for the periods presented and earned on a pro-rata basis over the term of the policies. Net premiums written is a statutory financial measure which represents the premiums charged on policies issued during a fiscal period less any applicable reinsurance. Net premiums written is designed to determine production levels and is meant as supplemental information and not intended to replace net premiums earned. Such information should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial results. See \"Supplemental Schedules\" above for a reconciliation of net premiums earned to net premiums written.\nIncurred losses and loss adjustment expenses is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to paid losses and loss adjustment expenses. Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses excludes the effects of changes in the loss reserve accounts. Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses is provided as supplemental information and is not intended to replace incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses. It should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial results. See \"Supplemental Schedules\" above for a reconciliation of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses to paid losses and loss adjustment expenses.\nCombined ratio is the most directly comparable measure to combined ratio-accident period basis. Combined ratio-accident period basis is computed as the difference between two GAAP operating ratios: the combined ratio and prior accident periods' loss development ratio. Management believes that combined ratio-accident period basis is useful to investors and it is used to reveal the trends in the Company's results of operations that may be obscured by development on prior accident periods' loss reserves. Combined ratio-accident period basis is meant as supplemental information and is not intended to replace the GAAP combined ratio. It should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial results. See \"Supplemental Schedules\" above for a reconciliation of GAAP combined ratio to combined ratio-accident period basis.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mercury-general-corporation-announces-first-quarter-results-and-declares-quarterly-dividend-300638455.html\nSOURCE Mercury General Corporation",
