    "text": "0 COMMENTS Why always us? Qualcomm QCOM -4.35% may be tempted to ask. The chip maker is once again caught in the middle of the trade tensions between China and the U.S.\nQualcomm’s latest predicament involves its planned $44 billion purchase of rival NXP Semiconductors , NXPI -4.61% a deal aimed at helping it diversify away from dependence on the slowing mobile-phone market and into growth spots like automotives and the so-called “Internet of Things.” China’s antitrust regulator said Thursday a preliminary review of the transaction has found “ issues that are hard to resolve .” China is the only country that hasn’t yet approved the deal.\nThe two companies said Thursday that they have refiled the application, buying them more time to get China’s approval.\nA takeover attempt of Qualcomm by then-Singapore-based Broadcom AVGO -3.16% last month was blocked by the Trump administration , which cited concerns that deal would undermine U.S. strength in the race against China in 5G, the next-generation mobile network.\nThere have been some legitimate antitrust concerns about the Qualcomm-NXP tie-up. The European Commission, for instance, has suggested the combination would allow Qualcomm to bundle sales of its baseband chips, used for handset communications, with NXP’s NFC chips used in mobile payments, in a way that would hurt consumers. In response, Qualcomm has pledged to ensure its chips will function with those of its competitors for eight years. Such concessions were enough to win the nod of European and other regulators.\nChina could yet be satisfied by similar remedies: The country has seldom blocked mergers of non-Chinese companies outright. Still, this rare high-profile comment on a pending deal indicates Beijing is prepared to take the transaction hostage as it negotiates with the U.S. on trade and market access.\nFor it is likely no coincidence that China’s tough words on Qualcomm-NXP have come soon after the U.S. government this week banned American firms from selling goods to China’s telecom-equipment maker ZTE, a Qualcomm customer. That ban has put ZTE, one of China’s biggest tech companies, in a precarious situation and exposed China’s broader reliance on foreign chips . The country is the biggest consumer of semiconductors, but none of its firms are among the largest producers. Chinese smartphone makers, for example, are big buyers of chips from both Qualcomm and NXP: Indeed, Qualcomm generates 65% of its revenue in China.\nBlocking or imposing heavy remedies on the Qualcomm-NXP deal won’t cure China’s dependency on foreign chip suppliers, or help ZTE much. It would, though, signal that the country is quite happy to make life as difficult as possible for U.S. companies in retaliation for perceived slights. That isn’t good for the prospects of this tech megadeal, and should bring a chill to the broader outlook for global deal-making.\n“Made in China 2025” is Beijing’s industrial plan to dominate high-tech industries including robotics, aerospace and computer chips. The Trump administration argues China is using the plan to give its tech companies unfair advantage over foreign rivals. But what is it exactly? Write to Jacky Wong at JACKY.WONG@wsj.com",
