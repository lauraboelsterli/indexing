(CSE: PVOT / OTCQB: PVOTF / FRA: NPAT ) (\"Pivot\" or the \"Company\") reports that it has terminated the previously announced letter of intent that it had entered into for the acquisition of Agro-Biotech.\n\"Despite our extensive efforts, we have been unable to complete the acquisition of Agro-Biotech in accordance with the terms and conditions initially agreed upon by the parties. While we are extremely disappointed with this outcome, Pivot continues to pursue other value-enhancing opportunities for the Company and its shareholders,\" said Patrick Frankham, CEO of Pivot.\nPivot is currently reviewing the legal alternatives available to it to obtain recovery from Agro-Biotech of the amounts expended by it in the pursuit of this transaction, as well as further damages resulting from the non-completion of the transaction.\nAbout Pivot Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nPivot Pharmaceuticals Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development and commercialization of therapeutic pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals using innovative drug delivery platform technologies.
