Paulo on Tuesday. \nThe unit, based in Terre Haute, Indiana, has 350,000 tonnes a year in capacity, the paper said, citing sources close to the matter. \nThe paper said other companies such as Nucor Corp., Commercial Metals Co and ArcelorMittal SA had looked into the unit, but talks had progressed with Steel Dynamics. \nPress and investor relations representatives for CSN and Steel Dynamics did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
