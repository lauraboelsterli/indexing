    "text": "Los Angeles, CA, April 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- High Times, the authoritative voice of Cannabis culture for more than 40 years, today announced the acquisition of fast-growing online site Green Rush Daily. Terms of the acquisition were not released.\nGreen Rush Daily, with a fan base of more than 4 million monthly uniques and millions of social media followers, is one of the fastest growing Cannabis media companies in the world. It will continue to operate independently as a media company, but joins the High Times constellation of brands alongside the Cannabis Cup and more.\n“Green Rush Daily has built a large, loyal audience and is innovating coverage of Cannabis-related news, culture, business and much more,” said Adam Levin, CEO of High Times. “Adding Green Rush Daily to the High Times family strongly enhances our editorial coverage, online presence, audience type and advertiser reach. The deal will significantly benefit the advertisers and readers of both High Times and Green Rush Daily.”\nThe acquisition of Green Rush Daily is another significant expansion of High Times Media’s investments in the business of legal Cannabis, Levin said, adding a strong online media brand that enhances High Times’ already iconic position. In recent months, High Times also has invested significantly in live events, music, lifestyle offerings and related businesses under Levin’s leadership.\nHigh Times has filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to become a publicly listed company on NASDAQ. That process is expected to conclude in Q2 of this year.\nGreen Rush Daily, at http://greenrushdaily.com , calls itself “the voice of the Cannabis revolution.” In the short time since its founding in October, 2015, Green Rush has grown a large and loyal audience for its wide-ranging features and breaking stories on Cannabis news, culture, science, politics, business, technology, entertainment, lifestyle and related topics.\nGreen Rush receives more than 9.5 million pageviews monthly, from more than 4 million unique users. The site also has more than 1 million followers of its Facebook Page , and another 128,000 followers of its Instagram site .\nGreen Rush Daily will continue to operate as a stand-alone publication based in New York City’s Chelsea neighborhood, Levin said.\nAbout High Times:\nFor more than 40 years, High Times has been the authoritative voice of authentic cannabis culture, leading the fight for legalization and empowering the burgeoning industry’s legal entrepreneurs. High Times content spans digital, social, video and print platforms as well as location-based events highlighted by the Cannabis Cup global franchise and the High Times Business Summit conference series.
