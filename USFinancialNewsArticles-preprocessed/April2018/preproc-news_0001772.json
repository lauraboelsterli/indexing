    "text": "JOHANNESBURG, April 3 (Reuters) - Six members of South Africa’s National Union of Mineworkers were killed and several were injured when a bus was firebombed while transporting them to Modikwa, a mine operated by African Rainbow Minerals and Anglo American Platinum, the union said.\n“Six workers were burned beyond recognition and the other workers had to escape through windows. We also do not know what is the motive of the attack,” Phillip Mankge, the NUM’s North East Regional Secretary, said in a statement on Tuesday.\nThe attack took place late on Monday night.
