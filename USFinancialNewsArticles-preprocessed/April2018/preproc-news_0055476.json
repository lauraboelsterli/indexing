    "text": "Revenue Grows 8%, Net Adjusted EBITDA Improves 17%\nCreative Professional Business Grows 29%\nWOBURN, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Monotype Imaging Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: TYPE) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst quarter 2018 highlights\nRevenue for the quarter was $56.7 million, an increase of 8% year over year. Creative Professional revenue was $35.0 million, up 29% year over year. Net loss was $1.2 million; Non-GAAP net adjusted EBITDA was $11.0 million, or 19% of revenue. Operating cash flow was $7.5 million, an increase of 34% year over year; cash and cash equivalents stood at $85.4 million.\n“We had a solid start to 2018, driven by the continued execution of our enterprise sales strategy,” said Scott Landers, president and CEO of Monotype. “Global 2000 brands clearly see the value in our solutions, as this marks the fourth consecutive quarter of more than 20% year-over-year growth in Creative Professional.”\nTony Callini, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Monotype, said, “We remain focused on improving our margins and operating cash flow, as well as carrying the growth momentum we’ve experienced over the past several quarters.”\nFirst quarter 2018 operating results\nRevenue for the quarter increased 8% to $56.7 million, compared to $52.5 million for the first quarter of 2017. Creative Professional revenue was $35.0 million, a 29% increase from the first quarter of 2017. OEM revenue was $21.7 million, a decrease of 15% from the same period in 2017.\nGross margin for the quarter of 76.5% included a one-time royalty cost of $2.2 million related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standards. Excluding this non-recurring cost, gross margin in the first quarter was 80.4% as compared to 81.6% in the prior year quarter.\nNet loss was $1.2 million, compared to a net loss of $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Loss per diluted share was $0.03, the same as the prior year quarter.\nNon-GAAP net income, which excludes the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related compensation expense, and non-recurring expenses, net of taxes, was $8.9 million, compared to $6.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.22 compared to $0.16 in the prior year period.\nThe company’s effective tax rate in the quarter was 67%, as compared to 9% in the prior year period. The change was primarily due to the effects of the new tax reform legislation.\nNon-GAAP net adjusted EBITDA was $11.0 million, or 19% of revenue, compared to $9.4 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2018, Monotype has updated its definition of non-GAAP net adjusted EBITDA to be calculated as GAAP income (loss) from operations and adding back depreciation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related compensation and non-recurring expenses.\nCash and cash flow\nMonotype had cash and cash equivalents of $85.4 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to $82.8 million as of December 31, 2017 and $86.9 million as of March 31, 2017. The company generated $7.5 million of cash from operations in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 34% year over year. During the first quarter of 2018, the company repaid $3.0 million on its outstanding revolving line of credit.\nQuarterly Dividend\nMonotype’s most recent dividend payment of $0.116 per share was paid on April 20, 2018, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on April 2, 2018. A dividend of $0.116 cents per share will be paid on July 20, 2018, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on July 2, 2018.\nFinancial outlook\nMonotype is updating its full-year operating expense and earnings per share guidance to reflect non-recurring expenses incurred in the first quarter and a higher than anticipated effective tax rate, which is now expected to be 65%. Monotype’s second quarter and updated full-year financial guidance are set forth in the following tables:\n(in $ millions, except for per share data) Q2 2018 Full-Year 2018\nRevenue $57.0 – 61.0 $243.0 – $251.0 Non-GAAP net adjusted EBITDA $11.0 – $14.0 $59.5 – $66.5 Operating expenses $43.5 – $46.5\n$177.0 – $180.0\nGAAP earnings per diluted share $0.00 – $0.03\n$0.10 – $0.15\nNon-GAAP earnings per diluted share $0.09 – $0.12\n$0.47 – $0.52\nConference call details\nMonotype will host a conference call on Friday, April 27, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. EDT to discuss the company’s first quarter 2018 results and business outlook for 2018.

This non-GAAP information supplements and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles. Non-GAAP financial measures are used internally to manage the business, such as in establishing an annual operating budget and in reporting to lenders. Non-GAAP financial measures are used by Monotype management in its operating and financial decision-making because management believes these measures reflect ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Accordingly, Monotype believes it is useful for investors and others to review both GAAP and non-GAAP measures in order to (a) understand and evaluate current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, and (b) compare in a consistent manner the company’s current financial results with past financial results. The primary limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures are that these measures may not be directly comparable to the amounts reported by other companies and they do not include all items of income and expense that affect operations. Monotype management compensates for these limitations by considering the company’s financial results and outlook as determined in accordance with GAAP and by providing a detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables attached to this press release.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis release may contain forward-looking statements including those related to future revenues and operating results, the growth of the company’s business, the impact of the company’s revenue recognition policy, the impact of federal tax reform legislation, the execution of the company’s capital allocation and funding strategies and anticipated business momentum that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: risks associated with changes in the economic climate including decreased demand for the company’s products or products that incorporate the company’s solutions; risks associated with the company’s ability to adapt its products or services to new markets and to anticipate and quickly respond to evolving technologies and customer requirements; risks associated with the company’s development of and the market acceptance of new products, product features or services; risks associated with the company’s ability to expand products and services offered through acquired companies; risks associated with increased competition in markets the company serves, including the risks that increased competition may result in the company’s inability to gain new customers, retain existing customers or may force the company to reduce prices; risks associated with the ownership and enforcement of the company’s intellectual property; and risks associated with geopolitical conditions and changes in the financial markets. Additional disclosure regarding these and other risks faced by the company is available in the company’s public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the risk factors included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and subsequent filings. The forward-looking financial information set forth in this release reflects estimates based on information available at this time. These amounts could differ from actual reported amounts to be included in the company’s future earnings releases and public filings. While the company may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, the company specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if an estimate changes.\nAbout Monotype\nMonotype provides the design assets, technology and expertise that help create beautiful, authentic and impactful brands that customers will engage with and value, wherever they experience the brand, now and in the future.
