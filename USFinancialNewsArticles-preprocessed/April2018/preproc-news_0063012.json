    "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China’s services industry picked up in April, an official survey showed on Monday, as the sector extended a solid run of strong activity.\nFILE PHOTO: Members of JD.com's VIP delivery team attend a training session on business etiquette at the company headquarters in Beijing, China December 8, 2017. REUTERS/Jason Lee/File Photo The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose to 54.8 from 54.6 in March.\nThe services sector accounts for over half of China’s economy, with rising wages giving Chinese consumers more spending power.\nThe composite PMI covering both manufacturing and services activity rose to 54.1 in April, from March’s 54, well above the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction.\nReporting by Yifan Qiu and Matthew Miller; Editing by Shri Navaratnam\n ",
