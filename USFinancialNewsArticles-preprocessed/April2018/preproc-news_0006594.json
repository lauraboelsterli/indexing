    "text": "April 8, 2018 / 2:30 PM / Updated 23 minutes ago HIGHLIGHTS-Golf-U.S. Masters Day Four Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nAUGUSTA, Ga., April 8 (Reuters) - Highlights from the final round of the 82nd U.S. Masters on Sunday: \nTIGER SIGNS OFF WITH THREE-UNDER 69 \nTiger Woods, competing in his first major championship since 2015, shot his lowest score of the week — a three-under 69 in the final round — but it was of little consequence as he began the day 18 shots back of the leader. MCILROY ONE BACK OF LEADER REED AFTER TWO HOLES \nNorthern Irishman Rory McIlroy, trying to capture the final leg of the career grand slam, made a birdie at the par-five second to move one shot back of Patrick Reed, who made bogey at the first hole. SIMPSON MAKES CONSECUTIVE EAGLES \nWebb Simpson, who began the day at three over for the week, followed a birdie at the second hole with consecutive eagles at the par-four seventh and par-five eighth holes. COOL WEATHER GREETS EARLY STARTERS \nThe final round of the year’s first major got underway with the early starters taking to the course under cloudy skies and unusually cool conditions at Augusta National where the mid-morning temperature was 63 Fahrenheit (17 Celsius). REED, MCILROY GET READY FOR SHOWDOWN \nPatrick Reed will take a three-shot lead into the final round when he sets off with Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy in the day’s final pairing at 2:40 p.m. ET (1840 GMT).
