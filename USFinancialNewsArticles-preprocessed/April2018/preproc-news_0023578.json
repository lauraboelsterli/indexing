    "text": "April 12, 2018 / 12:17 PM / Updated 22 minutes ago Growth in London's finance centre to stall because of Brexit, says Santander boss Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - The chairwoman of Spain’s biggest bank Banco Santander ( SAN.MC ) Ana Botin warned on Thursday that growth in London’s financial centre was set to stall due to the turmoil triggered by Brexit. Spanish bank Santander's Executive Chairman Ana Botin presents the bank's new logotype during the annual general shareholders meeting in Santander, Spain March 23, 2018. REUTERS/Eloy Alonso \n“I don’t think so many companies or people are going to leave the UK, it is the people that are not coming that we should worry about because the UK was on a huge upward trend and that is not as strong now,” Botin told the audience at an event organised by the Wall Street Journal in London. \n“The U.S. is taking lots of steps to make their finance centre more competitive. It is not about the UK versus continental Europe, it is about the UK against the U.S. and the big financial centres.” Reporting By Andrew MacAskill, editing by Sinead Cruise",
