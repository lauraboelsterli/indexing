Prior to Auxilium, he was Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of Enobia Pharma, Inc. Prior to that, Mr. Trachtenberg served as Vice President and Associate General Counsel of Sepracor Inc.

Mr. Trachtenberg also held a Senior Counsel position at Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. before its acquisition by Abbott. Mr. Trachtenberg began his career at Blank Rome LLP. He holds a Juris Doctorate and Master of Business Administration from Temple University and a Bachelor of Science in Management from Tulane University.\n“I am honored to join Kala at this pivotal time in the Company’s development and look forward to working with the management team to further Kala’s mission of bringing innovative therapies to patients with eye diseases,” commented Mr. Trachtenberg.\nAbout Kala Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nKala is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutics using its proprietary mucus-penetrating particle (MPP) technology, with an initial focus on the treatment of eye diseases. Kala has applied the MPP technology to a corticosteroid designed for ocular applications, resulting in two lead product candidates. The product candidates are INVELTYS™ (KPI-121 1%) for the treatment of inflammation and pain following ocular surgery, for which an NDA has been accepted for review by the FDA, and KPI-121 0.25% for the temporary relief of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve substantial risks and uncertainties, including statements regarding the development and regulatory status of the company's product candidates, including INVELTYS™ (KPI-121 1%) for the treatment of inflammation and pain following ocular surgery and KPI-121 0.25% for the temporary relief of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, contained in this press release, including statements regarding the Company’s strategy, future operations, future financial position, future revenue, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of management, are forward-looking statements. The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “predict,” “project,” “target,” “potential,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “should,” “continue” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. The Company may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in its forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to: whether the data from our Phase 3 clinical trials of KPI-121 0.25% will warrant submission of an NDA on the timeline expected, or at all, whether any additional clinical trials will be required prior to submission of an NDA and whether any such NDA will be approved; whether our NDA for INVELTYS will be approved by its PDUFA date or at all; uncertainties inherent in the availability and timing of data from ongoing clinical trials; expectations for regulatory approvals to conduct trials or to market products; whether the Company’s cash resources will be sufficient to fund the Company’s foreseeable and unforeseeable operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for the Company’s expected timeline; other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of the Company’s product candidates; and other important factors, any of which could cause the Company’s actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements, discussed in the \"Risk Factors\" section of the Company’s most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings the Company makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These forward-looking statements represent the Company’s views as of the date of this release and should not be relied upon as representing the Company’s views as of any date subsequent to the date hereof.
