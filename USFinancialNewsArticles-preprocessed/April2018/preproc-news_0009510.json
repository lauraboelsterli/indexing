For the purpose of the study, Unison assumed a 4.625 percent mortgage interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, property taxes of 1.25 percent per year and home insurance cost of 0.4 percent per year on the value of the home. \nThe resulting salaries assume homeowners aren't spending more than the recommended 30 percent of their income on housing.\nBelow, take a closer look at what you'd need to earn annually to afford to purchase a home in 11 major U.S. cities. \nNew York, New York Salary required for a 10 percent down payment: $418,482\nSalary required for a 20 percent down payment: $350,000\nMedian home price: $1.6 million\nSan Francisco, California Salary required for a 10 percent down payment: $349,650\nSalary required for a 20 percent down payment: $292,000\nMedian home price: $1.3 million\nLos Angeles, California Salary required for a 10 percent down payment: $187,306\nSalary required for a 20 percent down payment: $156,000\nMedian home price: $714,935\nMichael Riffle | Getty Images Seattle, Washington Seattle, Washington Salary required for a 10 percent down payment: $171,575\nSalary required for a 20 percent down payment: $143,000\nMedian home price: $654,889\nPortland, Oregon Salary required for a 10 percent down payment: $107,692\nSalary required for a 20 percent down payment: $90,000\nMedian home price: $496,328\nDenver, Colorado Salary required for a 10 percent down payment: $95,360\nSalary required for a 20 percent down payment: $79,000\nMedian home price: $363,984\nDennis Macdonald | Photolibrary | Getty Images Interstate 75 in downtown Atlanta Atlanta, Georgia Salary required for a 10 percent down payment: $61,847\nSalary required for a 20 percent down payment: $51,000 \nMedian home price: $236,065\nPhoenix, Arizona Salary required for a 10 percent down payment: $53,388\nSalary required for a 20 percent down payment: $44,000\nMedian home price: $203,777 \nDallas, Texas Salary required for a 10 percent down payment: $48,887\nSalary required for a 20 percent down payment: $40,000\nMedian home price: $186,597\nGetty Images Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Salary required for a 10 percent down payment: $37,429\nSalary required for a 20 percent down payment: $31,000\nMedian home price: $142,864\nKansas City, Missouri Salary required for a 10 percent down payment: $29,036\nSalary required for a 20 percent down payment: $24,000\nMedian home price: $110,827\nDon't miss: \nUS states with the highest levels of income inequality Take a look inside an $18 million beach house in the same exclusive neighborhood as Warren Buffett Suze Orman: Here's the No. 1 thing to do now if you want to buy a home soon Like this story?
