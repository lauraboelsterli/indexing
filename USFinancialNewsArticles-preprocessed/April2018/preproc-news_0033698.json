(Online banks are able to offer higher-yielding accounts online because they come with less overhead expenses than traditional bank accounts.) \"If you're not keeping pace with inflation, you are losing money.\" -Greg McBride, Bankrate's chief financial analyst \nAll in, depositors now have $11.95 trillion at U.S. commercial banks, close to a record high, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \nThe average balance among savers is $40,840, according to an estimate by MagnifyMoney based on Federal Reserve consumer finance data. \nAt 0.18 percent, a $40,000 deposit earns just $72 after one year. At 2 percent, that same $40,000 deposit would earn $800 – a difference of $728. \n\"If you could get nearly $1,000 a year, that's real money,\" said Nick Clements, co-founder and head of content at MagnifyMoney.com . \"You are not going to get rich, but it is not immaterial.\" \nFurthermore, \"if you're not keeping pace with inflation, you are losing money,\" McBride added. \"The Federal Reserve is trying to get inflation to 2 percent — that's the bogey to aim for.\" \nMore from Personal Finance: Those index funds in your 401(k) plan could cost you Giving money to adult children could trigger your financial ruin \nYou can earn even more with CDs , or certificates of deposit, if you don't need your money for an extended period of time and you shop around. The national average is still just 0.51 percent but the average on top-yielding CDs is as high as 2.2 percent, according to Bankrate. \n(With CDs, you can withdraw the interest at any time throughout the term, but there are penalties for withdrawing the original deposit. To avoid tying up too much cash at once, savers can also \"ladder\" their CDs, where you deposit money into, a one-, two- and three-year CD, for example.)
