    "text": "April 17, 2018 / 8:48 AM / Updated 10 hours ago Authorities join forces to secure World Beach Games future Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - The Global Association of International Sports Federations (GAISF) and the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC) have signed an agreement to share the organization of the World Beach Games after the 2019 edition. \nThe World Beach Games is a global gathering that will comprise 15 sports at the inaugural ANOC-organized competition taking place in San Diego next year. \nThe new deal will see the bodies form a 50-50 partnership to organize the Games through a jointly-held company in Switzerland for every two years after the first edition. \n“We are delighted to have reached this agreement to work in partnership with ANOC to ensure a bright future for the World Beach Games,” GAISF president Patrick Baumann said in a statement released by ANOC. \n“ ...The partnership will ensure that GAISF continues to fulfil its role of providing showcase events for our Member Federations, promoting new disciplines and bringing the expertise from all International Federations to the table.” \nThe program for the Beach Games will be decided in agreement with the International Olympics Committee (IOC). In principle, no Olympic events are allowed to be included in future Beach Games. \nBeach soccer, open water swimming, beach handball, beach tennis, wakeboarding and kiteboarding are among the sports involved in the event.
