Photo: The Wall Street Journal \nSocial Finance Inc. , the Boston-based online lender, has hired former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner Michelle Gill as chief financial officer, effective April 30. Ms. Gill succeeds Steve Freiberg who had been serving as interim CFO since Nino Fanlo left the role in May 2017. Ms. Gill comes to SoFi from TPG Sixth Street Partners, a company she joined last year after 14 years at Goldman. Compensation details werenâ€™t immediately available.\nCooper Tire & Rubber Co. , a Findlay, Ohio-based manufacturer of car and truck tires, said Ginger Jones , its senior vice president and CFO, will retire later this year. Ms. Jones will remain in her current role until a successor is named and an orderly transition is completed. She joined the company in 2014. Cooper has initiated the search for a successor, involving internal and external candidates, according to a release.\nShare this: CFO MOVES Previous The Morning Ledger: Trade Worries Percolate Across U.S. Manufacturing, Farming  ",
