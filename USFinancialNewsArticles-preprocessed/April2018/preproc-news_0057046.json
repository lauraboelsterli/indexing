    "text": "NEW YORK, April 26 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields stayed at lower levels on Thursday with the benchmark 10-year yield below 3 percent as a drop in domestic core capital good orders in March offset a decline in jobless benefit filings to their lowest level in over 48 years.\nAt 8:37 a.m. (1237 GMT), the yield on 10-year Treasury notes was down nearly 3 basis points at 2.998 percent. It touched 3.035 percent on Wednesday, which was its highest level since January 2014, Reuters data showed. (Reporting by Richard Leong Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)\n ",
