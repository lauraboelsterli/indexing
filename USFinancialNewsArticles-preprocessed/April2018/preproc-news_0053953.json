Revenues fell 12 percent to 10.119 billion euros. Airbus reaffirmed financial forecasts, however.\nAnalysts were on average expecting a 23.9 million euro operating loss on revenues of 10.209 billion, according to a Reuters poll. $1 = 0.8258 euros Reporting by Tim Hepher, Cyril Altmeyer; Editing by Richard Lough",
