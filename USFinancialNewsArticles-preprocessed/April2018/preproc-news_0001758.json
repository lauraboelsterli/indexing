Soccer Football - Champions League Quarter Final First Leg - Liverpool vs Manchester City - Anfield, Liverpool, Britain - April 4, 2018 Manchester City team bus is hit by missiles outside the stadium before the match Action Images via Reuters/Carl Recine \nLiverpool fans had organised a “coach welcome” for their Premier League rivals and their own team, lining a side street where the team buses were known to be arriving at the ground. \n“We apologise unreservedly to Pep Guardiola, his players, staff and officials caught up in the incident,” Liverpool said in a statement. Slideshow (7 Images) \n“The behaviour of a number of individuals was completely unacceptable and the club will cooperate fully with the authorities to identify those responsible.” \nFans let off red flares and sang their club’s songs before the City coach arrived and beer cans were thrown at the bus. At least one bottle was thrown and smashed on the side of the bus but did not break any of its windows. Reporting by Simon Evans, editing by Ed Osmond",
