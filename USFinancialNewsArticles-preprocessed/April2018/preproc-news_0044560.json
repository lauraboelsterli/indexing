    "text": "FORT WORTH, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pier 1 Imports, Inc. (NYSE:PIR) today reported financial results for the 14-week fourth quarter and 53-week fiscal year ended March 3, 2018. Except where indicated, fourth quarter and full year comparisons reflect the 14-week and 53-week periods ended March 3, 2018, and the 13-week and 52-week periods ended February 25, 2017.\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Highlights\nNet sales decreased 3.1% to $512.2 million, which includes approximately $27.5 million from the 14 th week in the Company’s fiscal 2018 fourth quarter; Company comparable sales on a 13-week basis decreased 7.5%; E-Commerce sales penetration reached approximately 25%; and Earnings per share of $0.19 (GAAP) and adjusted earnings per share of $0.21 (non-GAAP), including an estimated benefit of approximately $0.04 per share from the 14 th week in the Company’s fiscal 2018 fourth quarter.\nFull Year Fiscal 2018 Highlights\nNet sales decreased 1.6% to $1.8 billion; Company comparable sales on a 52-week basis decreased 2.0%; E-Commerce sales exceeded $450 million, with sales penetration reaching approximately 26%; Earnings per share of $0.14 (GAAP) and adjusted earnings per share of $0.21 (non-GAAP); Generated positive cash flow from operations of $66 million; and Established new executive leadership team and developed three-year strategic plan now in initial phase of implementation.\n“Our financial performance in fiscal 2018, and specifically the fourth quarter, underscores the urgent need for change, which we are addressing in the three-year strategic plan we will present tomorrow,” said Alasdair James, President and CEO. “In fiscal 2019, we will be investing in the tools and resources needed to execute against the plan. We are confident in the potential of the business to respond and have already begun implementing new initiatives across sourcing, supply chain, stores, merchandising, marketing and promotions. These investments will pressure profitability in the near-term, bringing us to an expected net loss for the full year in fiscal 2019, but are expected to drive sales growth and profitability in fiscal 2020 and 2021 and are necessary to help us return the business to a sustainable growth trajectory. We look forward to sharing our three-year strategic plan and financial outlook tomorrow at our Analyst Day.”\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Results of Operations\nNet sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased 3.1% to $512.2 million, compared to $528.4 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.

E-Commerce represented approximately 25% of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, as compared to approximately 20% of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Taking into account e-Commerce orders placed in or picked up in-store, approximately 90% of the Company’s fourth quarter fiscal 2018 net sales directly touched a store.\nGross profit for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 totaled $189.7 million, or 37.0% of net sales, compared to $206.9 million, or 39.2% of net sales, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Merchandise margin (the result of adding back delivery and fulfillment net costs and store occupancy costs to gross profit) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 totaled $284.8 million, or 55.6% of net sales, compared to $299.5 million, or 56.7% of net sales, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, reflecting increased promotional activity. Contribution from operations (gross profit less compensation for operations and operational expenses) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 totaled $99.5 million, compared to $118.5 million last year.\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 were $148.2 million, or 28.9% of net sales, compared to $148.5 million, or 28.1% of net sales, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The following table details the breakdown of SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to last year (in millions).\n14 Weeks Ended 13 Weeks Ended March 3, 2018 February 25, 2017 Expense % Sales Expense % Sales Compensation for operations $ 65.8 12.9 % $ 64.5 12.2 % Operational expenses 24.4 4.8 % 24.0 4.5 % Marketing 23.0 4.5 % 24.2 4.6 % Other selling, general and administrative 35.0 6.8 % 35.8 6.8 % Total selling, general and administrative $ 148.2 28.9 % $ 148.5 28.1 % Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $27.9 million compared to $44.8 million last year.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, net income was $26.6 million, or $0.33 per share, and adjusted net income (non-GAAP) was $27.8 million, or $0.34 per share.

Fiscal 2017 net income totaled $30.1 million, or $0.37 per share, and adjusted net income (non-GAAP) was $35.7 million, or $0.44 per share.

Inventories at the end of fiscal 2018 decreased 13.4% to $347.4 million, compared to $401.0 million a year ago.\nThe Company did not repurchase any shares under its common stock repurchase plan during the quarter ended March 3, 2018. Of the Company’s $200 million share repurchase program announced in April 2014, $26.6 million remains available for repurchases. The Board of Directors has determined to discontinue share repurchases at the present time under the Company’s existing share repurchase program.\nReal Estate Optimization Initiative\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company opened 1 and closed 9 stores. The Company closed a total of 15 net stores in fiscal year 2018.\nStore Statistics\nStore Count Three Months Ended Start Openings Closures End Relocations (1)\nMay 27, 2017 1,018 1 (3) 1,016 1 August 26, 2017 1,016 - (4) 1,012 - November 25, 2017 1,012 - (1) 1,011 - March 3, 2018 1,011 1 (9) 1,003 1 Full-Year Fiscal 2018 1,018 2 (17) 1,003 2 May 28, 2016 1,032 3 (8) 1,027 3 August 27, 2016 1,027 2 (6) 1,023 2 November 26, 2016 1,023 2 (3) 1,022 1 February 25, 2017 1,022 - (4) 1,018 - Full-Year Fiscal 2017 1,032 7 (21) 1,018 6 (1) Relocations are noted only in the period in which the new store opens. Company Discontinues Common Stock Dividend\nThe Board of Directors has determined to discontinue the common stock dividend, which will enable the Company to allocate greater resources toward implementing its three-year strategic plan to drive sales and earnings growth and increase shareholder value. Discontinuing the quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share is expected to contribute approximately $22 million of incremental cash flow in fiscal 2019.\nTax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”) was signed into law. The Tax Act revised many aspects of the U.S. corporate income tax including, but not limited to, a decrease in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. Based on Pier 1’s fiscal calendar, the Company is subject to a blended U.S. corporate income tax rate of 32.7% for fiscal year 2018 ended March 3, 2018. The lower federal tax rate for fiscal year 2018, combined with our provisional estimate of the remeasurement of our federal deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new lower U.S. corporate income tax rate, resulted in a net tax benefit of $0.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. The Company expects to complete its analysis within the one-year measurement period allowed by the SEC, and any necessary adjustment to the provisional estimate of the remeasurement of our federal deferred tax assets and liabilities will be recorded in tax expense in fiscal year 2019.\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Financial Results Conference Call\nThe Company will hold a conference call to discuss fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2018 financial results at 4:00 p.m. Central Time/5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 18, 2018. A live audio webcast will be accessible at the Company’s website at https://investors.pier1.com . The call can also be accessed domestically at (866) 378-2926 and internationally at (409) 350-3152, conference ID 1199178.\nOutlook\nThe Company will present its three-year strategic plan and outlook, and provide financial guidance for the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2019 at its Analyst Day being held Thursday, April 19, 2018, from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The event will be webcast live and archived on the Company’s investor relations website at https://investors.pier1.com .\nFinancial Disclosure Advisory\nThe Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). This press release references non-GAAP financial measures including merchandise margin, contribution from operations, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share.\nThe Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release allow management and investors to understand and compare results in a more consistent manner for the 14-week and 53-week periods ended March 3, 2018, and the 13-week and 52-week periods ended February 25, 2017. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental and not a substitute for the Company’s results reported in accordance with GAAP for the periods presented.\nMerchandise margin represents the result of adding back delivery and fulfillment net costs and store occupancy costs to gross profit. Contribution from operations represents gross profit less compensation for operations (which includes store and customer service payroll) and operational expenses. EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Management believes merchandise margin, contribution from operations and EBITDA are meaningful indicators of the Company’s performance which provide useful information to investors regarding its financial condition and results of operations. Management uses merchandise margin, contribution from operations and EBITDA, together with financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, to assess the Company’s operating performance, to enhance its understanding of core operating performance and to compare the Company’s operating performance to other retailers. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or used as an alternative to GAAP financial measures and do not purport to be an alternative to net income or gross profit as a measure of operating performance. A reconciliation of net income to EBITDA to contribution from operations to merchandise margin is shown below for the periods indicated (in millions).\n14 Weeks Ended 13 Weeks Ended 53 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended March 3, 2018 February 25, 2017 March 3, 2018 February 25, 2017 $ Amount % of Sales $ Amount % of Sales $ Amount % of Sales $ Amount % of Sales Merchandise margin (non-GAAP) $ 284.8 55.6 % $ 299.5 56.7 % $ 1,026.2 57.1 % $ 1,048.2 57.3 % Less:\nDelivery and fulfillment net costs\n21.6 4.2 % 20.3 3.8 % 77.6 4.3 % 59.0 3.2 % Store occupancy costs 73.5 14.3 % 72.3 13.7 % 290.5 16.2 % 291.9 16.0 % Gross profit (GAAP) 189.7 37.0 % 206.9 39.2 % 658.1 36.6 % 697.3 38.1 % Less:\nCompensation for operations\n65.8 12.9 % 64.5 12.2 % 239.9 13.3 % 249.7 13.7 % Operational expenses 24.4 4.8 % 24.0 4.5 % 88.8 4.9 % 87.6 4.8 % Contribution from operations (non-GAAP) 99.5 19.4 % 118.5 22.4 % 329.5 18.3 % 360.1 19.7 % Less:\nOther nonoperating income\n- 0.0 % (0.1 ) 0.0 % (1.5 ) (0.1 )% (1.1 ) (0.1 )% Marketing and other SG&A 58.0 11.3 % 60.1 11.4 % 248.2 13.8 % 250.6 13.7 % EBITDA (non-GAAP) 41.5 8.1 % 58.5 11.1 % 82.7 4.6 % 110.6 6.0 % Less:\nIncome tax provision\n10.5 2.0 % 16.0 3.1 % 6.3 0.4 % 15.1 0.9 % Interest expense, net 2.4 0.5 % 2.2 0.4 % 11.2 0.6 % 10.7 0.6 % Depreciation 13.6 2.7 % 13.6 2.6 % 53.6 3.0 % 54.6 3.0 % Net income (GAAP) $ 15.1 2.9 % $ 26.6 5.0 % $ 11.6 0.6 % $ 30.1 1.6 % This press release also references adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, each of which excludes legal and regulatory costs related to California wage-and-hour litigation and an ongoing CPSC inquiry in fiscal 2018, and CEO departure-related costs in fiscal 2017.
