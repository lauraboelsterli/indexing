    "text": "GREENWICH, Conn., April 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- FrontFour Capital Group LLC, together with its affiliates (\"FrontFour\" or \"we\"), a significant shareholder of Obsidian Energy Ltd. (\"Obsidian\" or, the \"Company\") (TSX/NYSE: OBE) with an ownership interest of approximately 6.3% of the Company's outstanding shares, today announced that it has formally provided advance notice to the Company of the nomination of a slate of four highly-qualified candidates for election to the Board of Directors (the \"Board\") at the Company's 2018 Annual and Special Meeting of Shareholders (\"2018 AGM\") to be held on May 11, 2018.\nFrontFour has also issued the following open letter to Obsidian shareholders:\nA LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF OBSIDIAN ENERGY LTD.\nApril 3, 2018\nDear Fellow Shareholders,\nAs previously disclosed, FrontFour and its principals are significant long-term shareholders of Obsidian, collectively beneficially owning over 31 million shares, representing approximately 6.3% of Obsidian's outstanding shares. In contrast to Obsidian's current Board, our interests are directly aligned with yours. After years of enduring substantial share price underperformance at Obsidian, our goal is to drive significant value creation for the benefit of all Obsidian shareholders.\nOn April 2, 2018, Obsidian publicly announced that it had commenced a process to explore the sale of the Alberta Viking and Peace River assets as part of an effort to focus on growth in the Cardium. This followed an announcement late last week that Obsidian scheduled its 2018 AGM for May 11, 2018, with a record date of April 4, 2018, although its annual meeting is customarily held in June. We interpret the incumbent Board's action in setting a significantly earlier meeting date as an attempt to minimize the time that FrontFour has to conduct its campaign and use historically low voter turn-out to its advantage.\nThe Board's Recent Strategic Review Announcement Validates FrontFour's Strategy, is Reactionary and Represents Yet Another About-Face on Strategy\nOn January 17, 2018, FrontFour first publicly expressed concerns with the Board and laid out an action plan to streamline the Company's asset footprint to focus on becoming a standout light oil growth player and Cardium champion. Obsidian quickly responded by stating that its business plan, centered on sustaining a low-decline production base while leveraging significant development optionality, was working, and that \"a change of course would hinder Obsidian's progress.\"\nOn March 20, 2018, we announced our intention to nominate four directors for election to the Board, vote against the proposed reverse stock split, and outlined a plan to dispose of Peace River and the Alberta Viking and redeploy the proceeds into debt repayment, stock buybacks and jump-starting production growth in the Cardium. Obsidian almost immediately responded to this with a press release on March 21, 2018 headlined \"FrontFour is Risking the Company's Progress.\"\nThis is proof positive that Obsidian's Board is out of touch with its shareholder base and in need of significant refreshment. We strongly disagree that Obsidian's stated strategy as of June 2017 represents \"progress\" when it has led to anemic production and cash-flow growth, a track record of blown operating targets and disastrous hedge losses culminating in the receipt of a NYSE delisting notice.\nIt is also quite remarkable that less than two weeks after decrying FrontFour's articulated strategy as \"risking [the Company's] progress,\" Obsidian has now announced its intention to implement ALL publicly disclosed aspects of FrontFour's value creation plan, with David French claiming, \"[t]oday's announcement is the natural next step in our ongoing strategy to unlock shareholder value and establish Obsidian Energy as a growth company focused on optimizing our industry-leading position in the Cardium.\" This announcement is anything but \"natural\" and represents another clear about-face on strategy.\nObsidian's proposed asset sales and related strategic process are clearly material developments. In commenting upon them, Board chair Jay Thornton noted that \"[t]he process started in Q3 last year and accelerated in October when the Board selected RBC Capital Markets as our lead financial advisor.\" This flies in the face of recent trading activity by Obsidian's directors. Over the last few months, Obsidian directors have made market purchases of Obsidian shares, including as recently as March 13, 2018. Had the so-called process including asset sales been fulsome and truly active, then insiders would have been precluded from trading Obsidian shares. The insider purchases suggest that Obsidian's April 2 nd strategic review announcement is a recent development and a reaction to significant shareholder pressure.\nObsidian Insider Activity\nDirector\nTrade Date\nAction\n# of Shares\nGeorge Brookman\n2/5/2018\nBuy\n10,000\nJohn Brydson\n1/19/2018\nBuy\n336,723\nJohn Brydson\n1/22/2018\nBuy\n163,277\nRay Crossley\n3/13/2018\nBuy\n7,500\nDavid French\n2/2/2018\nBuy\n50,000\nDavid French\n2/6/2018\nBuy\n50,000\nMaureen Cormier Jackson\n12/14/2017\nBuy\n30,000\nJay Thornton\n2/9/2018\nBuy\n100,000\nThe Current Board Has Overseen Significant Value Destruction While Underperforming All Relevant Industry Indices\nAs evidenced by the chart below, Obsidian's Board has overseen the destruction of significant long-term shareholder value as reflected by the stark underperformance of Obsidian's shares relative to three prominent energy indices: (i) the S&P/Canadian Energy Index (XEG ETF), (ii) the Energy Select Sector Index (XLE ETF), and (iii) the S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Select Industry index (XOP ETF).\nAstonishingly, Obsidian's shares have traded down approximately 96% during the tenure of George Brookman as a director and 45% since David French became CEO in October of 2016.\nOBE Stock Price Performance Under Current Directors\nAbsolute Price Performance\nDate\nSince Joining Board\nJoined\nOBE\nXEG\nXLE\nXOP\nDirector\nBoard\nStock\nETF\nETF\nETF\nGeorge Brookman\n8/3/2005\n-95.9%\n-39.1%\n38.5%\nNA\nJay W.

Excludes dividends.\nNote: XOP ETF launched in June 2006.\nThe Board's disastrous historical record of oversight of management's repeated strategic missteps has resulted in an overhang on Obsidian's share price that, despite the recent announcement, in our view may only be lifted by a substantial overhaul in Board composition. We now urge our fellow shareholders to support FrontFour's efforts to drive value for all shareholders.\nBoard Compensation: Taking Equity at the Bottom\nIn Obsidian's April 2 nd press release, the Board announced their intention to receive all director fees in equity in lieu of cash. We find it interesting that the Board waited until now to finally align their interests with shareholders. As depicted in the charts below, the Board's historical actions have been anything but aligned. Per Obsidian's two most recent information circulars, only one director elected to receive more than 50% of his or her Board compensation in share-based awards. Additionally, as of the most recently available public data, four directors currently own significantly less than the minimum 100,000 share requirement, including George Brookman, despite his nearly 13-year Board tenure.\nObsidian Board Compensation (2015 to 2016)\nCash Fees Received\nShare-Based Awards\nTotal Compensation\n% Cash of Total\nDirector\n2015\n2016\n2015\n2016\n2015\n2016\n2015\n2016\nGeorge Brookman\n$115,017\n$89,125\n$24,817\n$21,875\n$139,834\n$111,000\n82%\n80%\nJohn Brydson\n-\n-\n$142,834\n$115,500\n$142,834\n$115,500\n0%\n0%\nRaymond Crossley\n$73,181\n$88,313\n$43,056\n$34,688\n$116,237\n$123,001\n63%\n72%\nWilliam Friley\n$90,063\n$93,750\n$16,875\n$18,750\n$106,938\n$112,500\n84%\n83%\nMaureen Cormier Jackson\nNA\n57,391\nNA\n$30,391\nNA\n$87,782\nNA\n65%\nJay Thornton\n$69,748\n$54,750\n$69,748\n$54,750\n$139,496\n$109,500\n50%\n50%\nGordon Ritche\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nEdward Kernaghan\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nSource: Obsidian public filings.\nNA denotes that individual was not on the Board of Directors during years listed.\nThe stated intention in the Company's April 2 nd announcement is simply too little, too late. While Obsidian's shareholders have suffered significant losses, a majority of Obsidian's legacy directors (excluding Ritchie and Kernaghan) have continued to enrich themselves by electing to take the vast majority of their director compensation in cash.\nIndependent Director Equity Ownership\nDirector\nShares (#)\nDSUs (#)\nTotal Equity (#)\nGeorge Brookman\n30,000\n51,693\n81,693\nJohn Brydson\n2,553,000\n196,799\n2,749,799\nRaymond Crossley\n19,000\n52,610\n71,610\nWilliam Friley\n50,648\n26,615\n77,263\nMaureen Cormier Jackson\n35,000\n24,677\n59,677\nJay Thornton\n288,750\n112,689\n401,439\nGordon Ritchie\n100,000\nNA\n100,000\nEdward Kernaghan\n34,791,375\nNA\n34,791,375\nSources: Obsidian 2017 Management Circular & Subsequent Public Filings\nGordon Ritchie and Ed Kernaghan DSUs have not yet been disclosed\nEdward Kernaghan's shareholdings includes all Kernaghan controlled entities\nFrontFour's Highly- Qualified Director Nominees Will Bring Technical Expertise, Oversight and Accountability to Help Steward Obsidian's Asset Optimization Strategy\nAs long-term shareholders, our goal is to hold the Board accountable for their performance and to ensure that the Board's interests are aligned with those of shareholders. Given the Obsidian Board's poor track record, continued failure to communicate, let alone execute, a clear and consistent corporate strategy to investors and the misalignment of the Board's interests with those of shareholders, we believe substantial change is warranted, especially as industry consolidation in the Cardium appears on the horizon. The incumbent Board cannot be counted on to take the appropriate value maximizing steps. Accordingly, FrontFour has formally provided advance notice of the nomination of four highly qualified nominees. If elected, we expect that our nominees would spearhead the implementation of a revised corporate strategy focused on streamlining the Company portfolio and growing Obsidian's light oil-weighted production in the Cardium. Our nominees would bring significant technical and financial expertise, as well as additional fresh perspectives and renewed accountability, to Obsidian's Board for the benefit of all shareholders. We are highly confident that such a dynamic will put Obsidian on a path towards unlocking the significant shareholder value embedded within its asset base.\nQuite clearly, the incumbent Board has failed shareholders and has a demonstrable track record of entrenchment. When FrontFour approached the Board in October 2017 as part of an effort to work constructively and privately towards unlocking value for shareholders, their immediate reaction was to take aggressive and defensive steps towards entrenchment and self-preservation, as opposed to anything related to enhancing shareholder value. When FrontFour stood firm, the Board opted to install Edward Kernaghan onto the Board, despite having resisted doing so since March 2016. This was principally due to Mr. Kernaghan's ability to further entrench the incumbent Board by virtue of his willingness to sign an off-market standstill and voting agreement obliging him to vote blindly for Obsidian's slate at the 2018 AGM. This behavior – on both sides of the negotiation – is a prime example of the insular, \"clubby\" mentality that now permeates Obsidian's boardroom to the detriment of shareholders. FrontFour and its nominees are committed to changing this culture for the benefit of all shareholders.\nOver the coming weeks, we look forward to engaging with you.\nBiographies of FrontFour's Nominees:\nSteven P.
