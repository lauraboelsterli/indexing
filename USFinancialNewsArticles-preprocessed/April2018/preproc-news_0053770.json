The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their comparable GAAP measures are included in the attached financial tables.\nWe believe that providing non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share offers investors useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enables comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business. Additionally, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the Company's performance.\nSpecifically, the non-GAAP financial measures contained herein exclude the following expense items:\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets: We amortize intangible assets acquired in connection with our June 2015 acquisition of Hudson IT and our July 2017 acquisition of the services division of InfoTrellis, Inc. We exclude these amortization expenses in our non-GAAP financial measures because we believe it allows investors to make more meaningful comparisons between our operating results and those of other companies within our industry, and facilitates a helpful comparison of our results with other periods.\nStock-based compensation expenses: We incur material recurring expense related to non-cash, stock-based compensation. We exclude these expenses in our non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that it provides investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. In particular, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under ASC 718, we believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude these expenses allows investors to make more meaningful comparisons between our operating results and those of other companies within our industry, and facilitates comparison of our results with other periods.\nForward-Looking Statements:\nCertain statements contained in this release are forward-looking statements based on management's expectations, estimates, projections and assumptions. Words such as \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"scheduled,\" \"estimates\" and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, which include but are not limited to (i) projections of revenues, earnings, and cash flow, and (ii) the expected benefits to Mastech Digital from completing the acquisition of the services division of InfoTrellis, Inc. and the PNC credit facility and the expected performance of Mastech Digital following completion of these transactions. These statements are based on information currently available to the Company and it assumes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements as circumstances change. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks and uncertainties, which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual future results and trends may differ materially from what is forecast in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including, without limitation, the level of market demand for its services, the highly competitive market for the types of services offered by the Company, the impact of competitive factors on profit margins, market conditions that could cause the Company's customers to reduce their spending for its services, and the Company's ability to create, acquire and build new lines of business, to attract and retain qualified personnel, reduce costs and conserve cash, and other risks that are described in more detail in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nMASTECH DIGITAL, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(Amounts in thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\n2018\n2017\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$ 1,267\n$ 2,478\nAccounts receivable, net\n33,561\n30,662\nPrepaid and other current assets\n868\n1,533\nTotal current assets\n35,696\n34,673\nEquipment, enterprise software and leasehold improvements, net\n1,974\n1,899\nDeferred income taxes\n475\n468\nNon-current deposits\n294\n255\nGoodwill\n35,844\n35,844\nIntangible assets, net\n24,772\n25,465\nTotal assets\n$ 99,055\n$ 98,604\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n$ 4,194\n$ 4,003\nCurrent portion of contingent consideration liability\n6,125\n-\nAccounts payable\n4,395\n5,028\nAccrued payroll and related costs\n7,129\n8,969\nOther accrued liabilities\n2,487\n2,109\nTotal current liabilities\n24,330\n20,109\nLong-term liabilities:\nLong-term debt, less current portion, net\n34,968\n34,149\nContingent consideration liability, less current portion\n11,000\n17,125\nLong-term accrued income taxes\n68\n68\nTotal liabilities\n70,366\n71,451\nShareholders' equity:\nCommon stock, par value $0.01 per share\n63\n63\nAdditional paid-in capital\n20,411\n20,304\nRetained earnings\n12,303\n10,923\nAccumulated other comprehensive income\n66\n17\nTreasury stock, at cost\n(4,154)\n(4,154)\nTotal shareholders' equity\n28,689\n27,153\nTotal liabilities and shareholders' equity\n$ 99,055\n$ 98,604\nMASTECH DIGITAL, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(Amounts in thousands, except per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nRevenues\n$ 43,333\n$ 33,100\nCost of revenues\n33,072\n26,891\nGross profit\n10,261\n6,209\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n7,823\n5,806\nIncome from operations\n2,438\n403\nOther income/(expense), net\n(512)\n(81)\nIncome before income taxes\n1,926\n322\nIncome tax expense\n546\n121\nNet income\n$ 1,380\n$ 201\nEarnings per share:\nBasic\n$ 0.25\n$ 0.04\nDiluted\n$ 0.25\n$ 0.04\nWeighted average common shares outstanding:\nBasic\n5,461\n4,499\nDiluted\n5,529\n4,561\nMASTECH DIGITAL, INC.\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP MEASURES TO NON-GAAP MEASURES\n(Amounts in thousands, except per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nGAAP Net Income\n$ 1,380\n$ 201\nAdjustments:\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\n693\n203\nStock-based compensation\n105\n107\nIncome taxes adjustments\n(214)\n(117)\nNon-GAAP Net Income\n$ 1,964\n$ 394\nGAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share\n$ 0.25\n$ 0.04\nNon-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share\n$ 0.36\n$ 0.09\nWeighted average common shares outstanding:\nGAAP Diluted Shares\n5,529\n4,561\nNon-GAAP Diluted Shares\n5,529\n4,561\n2018 Non-GAAP Income Tax Adjustments:\nStaffing\nD&A\nD&A\nUSA\nCAD\nCAD\n123R\n105\n-\n-\nAmortization of acquired intangibles\n203\n483\n7\nTotal Non-GAAP Items\n308\n483\n7\nTax Rates\n27.3%\n26.5%\n25.0%\nNon-GAAP tax adjustment\n$ 84\n$ 128\n$ 2\nMASTECH DIGITAL, INC.\nSUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n(Amounts in thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nRevenues:\nIT staffing services\n$ 36,761\n$ 33,100\nData and analytics services\n6,572\n-\nTotal revenues\n$ 43,333\n$ 33,100\nGross Margin %:\nIT staffing services\n20.0%\n18.8%\nData and analytics services\n44.3%\n-\nTotal gross margin %\n23.7%\n18.8%\nSegment Operating Income:\nIT staffing services\n$ 1,356\n$ 606\nData and analytics services\n1,775\n-\nSubtotal\n3,131\n606\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\n(693)\n(203)\nInterest expense and other, net\n(512)\n(81)\nIncome before income taxes\n$ 1,926\n$ 322\nFor more information, contact:\nDonna Kijowski\nManager, Investor Relations\nMastech Digital, Inc.\n+1-888-330-5497\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mastech-digital-reports-31-revenue-growth-in-first-quarter-2018-300637093.html\nSOURCE Mastech Digital, Inc.",
