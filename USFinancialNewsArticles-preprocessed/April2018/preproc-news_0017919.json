    "text": "Expands into the Car Loan Segment\nBUENOS AIRES, Argentina--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Grupo Supervielle S.A. (NYSE:SUPV);(BYMA:SUPV), (“Supervielle” or the “Company”) a universal financial services group headquartered in Argentina with a nationwide presence, announced today that it has agreed to acquire 100% (or 4,000,000 ordinary shares) of the share ownership of Micro Lending S.A. (“MILA”) for a cash price of US$20 million, subject to final adjustments. Specialized in car financing, particularly for used cars, MILA is estimated to rank 4 th in the Argentine new and used car loan market, holding a total market share of approximately 6%, or 10% when considering the used car market on a stand-alone basis.\nPatricio Supervielle, Grupo Supervielle's Chairman and CEO, noted: “We believe the acquisition of MILA will allow us to complement our product offering and play a relevant role in the attractive car loan market, a key strategic segment. Through its 32 branches across the country and over 5,000 related agencies, MILA is well-positioned to continue capturing the attractive growth potential we see in this market, particularly in used car financing. Approximately two million used cars are expected to be sold in 2018, doubling the expected annual new car sales, and only around 8% of used cars are sold with financing a loan attached. The transaction will also provide MILA with access to funding to accelerate its growth strategy and leverage its current platform, while creating cross-selling opportunities across our Company and is expected to generate tax and operating synergies from the integration.”\nMILA´s loan portfolio, including its securitized and sold portfolio, totaled approximately Ps.900 million as of December 31, 2017 and close to 19,000 car loans with an average term of approximately 30 months. MILA also manages over 15,000 automobile insurance policies that generate monthly revenues. As of December 31, 2017, MILA had 90 employees. In its 12 years of operations, MILA has originated more than 77,000 car loans totaling US$430 million in origination.\nThe acquisition is expected to close in 2Q18 and remains subject to certain customary conditions precedent.\nAbout Grupo Supervielle S.A. (NYSE: SUPV); (BYMA: SUPV)\nGrupo Supervielle S.A. (“Supervielle”) is a holding company with a long standing presence in the Argentine financial system and a competitive leadership position in certain attractive market segments. It was founded by the Supervielle family, which took its first steps in the banking sector in 1887 and is now controlled by Patricio Supervielle.
