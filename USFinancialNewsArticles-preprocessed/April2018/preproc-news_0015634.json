    "text": "LOUISVILLE, Colo., April 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rezolute , Inc. (“Rezolute” or the “Company”) (OTCQB:RZLT), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of innovative drug therapies for metabolic and orphan diseases, announced today that Christine Ferrara, M.D., Ph.D., has joined the Company as Director of Clinical Development. In addition to supporting clinical development of the Company’s pipeline generally, Dr. Ferrara will have primary responsibility for the clinical development program of RZ358 for Congenital Hyperinsulinemia (CHI), a life-threatening ultra-orphan disease with a substantial unmet need for safer and more effective therapies. Dr. Ferrara joins Rezolute as the Company prepares to initiate a Phase 2b study of RZ358.\nDr. Ferrara is Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) where she also serves as head of the regional treatment center for patients with CHI. She brings to Rezolute a wealth of experience as a Principal Investigator on industry and government-sponsored clinical trials. Dr. Ferrara completed her Pediatrics Residency and Endocrinology Fellowship at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), an internationally recognized referral center for CHI patients, under the thought leadership and training of Drs. Diva D. De León-Crutchlow and Charles A. Stanley, also highly regarded key opinion leaders in CHI. Dr. Ferrara received a M.D. and Ph.D. from Duke University School of Medicine.\n“I am excited to join Rezolute as I believe RZ358 has the potential to become the primary treatment option for patients suffering with CHI, for whom there is often no adequate treatment,” stated Dr. Ferrara. “In addition, I look forward to developing therapies that intersect with my area of patient-care and research focus, while continuing to care for patients and families affected by CHI.”\n“As a recognized key opinion leader and therapeutic area expert who manages patients with CHI, Dr. Ferrara is a fantastic addition to our team,” said Nevan Elam, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Rezolute. “Current treatment options for CHI are ineffective, invasive or not well-tolerated. We look forward to Dr. Ferrara spearheading our late-stage clinical efforts for RZ358.”\nAbout Rezolute, Inc.\nRezolute is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of innovative drug therapies to improve the lives of patients with metabolic and orphan diseases. Rezolute is advancing a diversified pipeline including: RZ358 (Phase 2), an antibody for the ultra-orphan indication of Congenital HyperInsulinism (CHI) with an abbreviated path-to-market strategy; AB101 (Phase 1), a once-weekly injectable basal insulin with the potential to transform the treatment landscape in diabetes management by reducing the therapeutic burden for patients and improving compliance; and RZ402 (plan to file IND in H2 2018), a Plasma Kallikrein Inhibitor (PKI) targeting Diabetic Macular Edema (DME).
