    "text": "Aaron Judge hit a two-run homer and had three RBIs, Miguel Andujar keyed a seven-run sixth with a three-run double and the New York Yankees defeated the visiting Toronto Blue Jays 9-1 on Saturday afternoon.\nJordan Montgomery (2-0) held the Blue Jays to one run on four hits and three walks. The left-hander struck out five in six innings.\nBlue Jays starter Marcus Stroman (0-2) allowed eight runs (six earned), five hits and four walks while striking out five in 5 1/3 innings.\nThe Yankees (10-9) have won two of the first three games of the series against the Blue Jays (13-7) and will try to win the series in the finale Sunday afternoon at Yankee Stadium.\nAfter the Blue Jays did not score after loading the bases in the top of the third inning, the Yankees took a 2-0 lead in the bottom of the third when Judge followed a two-out walk by Brett Gardner with his sixth homer of the season, a blast to left on a 3-0 fastball.\nThe Blue Jays scored once in the fifth when Randal Grichuk led off with a walk and took third on a single by Lourdes Gurriel Jr. and scored on Steve Pearce’s single.\nThe Yankees broke the game open with a seven-run sixth.\nGardner led off with a single and took second on a wild pitch. Judge walked. Didi Gregorius singled to right to score Gardner and send Judge to third. Gregorius took second on a wild pitch. Giancarlo Stanton walked to load the bases.\nBlue Jays catcher Luke Maile was charged with an error that resulted in a run when he dropped the throw from Stroman on an attempted force out on Aaron Hicks’ grounder. Andujar cleared the bases with a double to left.\nJohn Axford, who replaced Stroman, walked Austin Romine, allowed a single to Ronald Torreyes and gave up a sacrifice fly to Gardner and an RBI single to Judge to complete the scoring in the inning.\nChasen Shreve pitched a perfect seventh and Jonathan Holder was perfect over the final two innings for New York.\n—Field Level Media\n 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
