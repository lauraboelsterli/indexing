    "text": "The person who allegedly shot at least three people at YouTube's campus on Tuesday afternoon has been identified as Nasim Najafi Aghdam, according to senior law enforcement officials. \nAghdam died from a self-inflicted gun shot wound, according to police.\nReuters reported that Aghdam's family warned the authorities that she may target YouTube prior to the shooting. Her father, Ismail Aghdam, warned police his daughter \"hated\" YouTube, and might go to the company's headquarters, The Mercury News reported. \nAghdam's online activity shows that she believed YouTube was deliberately obstructing her videos from being viewed. Her channel was deleted Tuesday. Police said they were still investigating possible motives.\n\"YouTube filtered my channels to keep them from getting views,\" she wrote on YouTube according to a screenshot of her account. \nPolice responded to YouTube headquarters in San Bruno, California, around 1 p.m. local time on Tuesday. Approximately 1,100 people work in the complex, which is about 20 miles away from Google 's main campus in Mountain View.\nSan Bruno police later tweeted an image of Aghdam.\nTweet \nAuthorities said terrorism does not appear to be a motive at this time. The woman, who was 39 years old, was initially believed to have carried out the attack because of a domestic dispute, according to The Mercury News , though subsequent information has contradicted that theory.\nThe shooter used a 9 mm handgun.\nâ€”NBC and Reuters contributed to this report.",
