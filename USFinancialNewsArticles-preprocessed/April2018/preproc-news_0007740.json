REUTERS/Files Below are the most prominent businessmen targeted along with their main assets and connections as well as extracts from the U.S. Treasury statement.\nDESIGNATED RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS OLEG DERIPASKA, main owner of En+, co-owner of Rusal and Norilsk Nickel\nDeripaska is ranked by Forbes magazine as Russia’s 19th richest businessman with a net worth of $6.7 billion. Deripaska holds regular meetings with Putin, invested heavily in Russia’s 2014 Sochi winter Olympics, and has said his own interests are indivisible from the state’s.\nEn+ has a 48 percent stake in Rusal, one of the world’s largest aluminium producers. Rusal is listed in Hong Kong and counts Glencore among its shareholders.\nRusal has assets in Italy, Ireland, Sweden, as well as Nigeria, Guyana, Guinea, and a stake in Australian QAL, the world’s top alumina refinery. Over 10 percent of Rusal’s total sales go to the United States.\nFROM U.S. TREASURY STATEMENT: “Oleg Deripaska is being designated ... for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, a senior official of the Government of the Russian Federation, as well as ... for operating in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy.”\nVIKTOR VEKSELBERG, key owner of Renova holding group\nForbes magazine ranks Vekselberg as Russia’s ninth richest businessman with a net worth of $14.4 billion. He is famous for bringing back a collection of Faberge eggs to Russia.\nApart from Russia, Renova has assets in the United States and Europe, of which the most notable are stakes in the Swiss companies Sulzer, Schmolz+Bickenbach and Oerlikon.

Vekselberg is the founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Renova Group.”\nKIRILL SHAMALOV, minority shareholder with petrochemical company Sibur\nShamalov married Putin’s youngest daughter Katerina in February 2013, multiple sources who were at the wedding told Reuters. After the marriage, he swiftly grew his wealth through investments in Russia’s biggest petrochemical company Sibur. Unconfirmed media reports say Shamalov and Putin’s daughter have since split.\nForbes magazine says Shamalov is Russia’s 72nd richest businessman with a net worth of $1.4 billion. Shamalov now owns 3.9 pct in Sibur. Gennady Timchenko, a close associate of President Vladimir Putin, holds a stake in the company as well. Sibur is not under sanctions.\nFROM U.S. TREASURY STATEMENT: “Kirill Shamalov is being designated for operating in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy. Shamalov married Putin’s daughter Katerina Tikhonova in February 2013 and his fortunes drastically improved following the marriage.”\nANDREI SKOCH, a deputy in the Russian State Duma, the lower house of parliament\nForbes magazine says Skoch is Russia’s 23rd wealthiest businessman with a net worth of $4.9 billion. Skoch’s father, Vladimir, owns a stake in USM holding. Businessman Alisher Usmanov is a key shareholder in USM. Neither Usmanov nor USM are under sanctions.\nVia USM, Skoch’s father co-owns Metalloinvest, Russia’s largest and the world’s second-largest mining company by the size of iron ore reserves, with units in Ireland, Switzerland and Guinea.\nUSM also has stakes in Megafon, Russia’s second largest mobile operator, in MAIL.RU Group, one of Russia’s largest internet companies, and in Russian social networks VKontakte and Odnoklassniki.\nUSM also has stakes in Alibaba, JD.com, Xiaomi, Uber, Spotify, Airbnb, Zalando, Flipkart, Ola Cabs, Didi Chuxing, ZocDoc and Klarna.\nFROM U.S. TREASURY STATEMENT: “Andrei Skoch is being designated for being an official of the Government of the Russian Federation.

Kerimov is a member of the Russian Federation Council.”\nVLADIMIR BOGDANOV, chief executive of oil company Surgutneftegaz\nForbes magazine puts Bogdanov’s net worth at $1.8 billion, making him Russia’s 53rd wealthiest businessman.\nSiberia’s Surgut sits on Russia’s biggest corporate cash pile, with bank deposits and cash totalling 2.2 trillion roubles ($38 billion) in 2017, according to Reuters calculations based on its regulatory filings.\nThe company is owned by its employees, according to official data. Gennady Timchenko, a friend of Putin who is under U.S. sanctions, said in a 2012 interview with Forbes magazine that Surgut was trading oil through Timchenko’s trading companies.\nSurgutneftegaz is already under sanctions.\nFROM U.S. TREASURY STATEMENT: “Vladimir Bogdanov is being designated for operating in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy. Bogdanov is the Director General and Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of Surgutneftegaz, a vertically integrated oil company operating in Russia.”\nIGOR ROTENBERG, son of Arkady Rotenberg, Putin’s former judo partner\nForbes magazine says Igor Rotenberg is Russia’s 93rd richest businessman and worth $1.1 billion.\nArkady Rotenberg and his brother Boris Rotenberg are already under sanctions due to their close connections to Putin whom they have known since they practised judo together in St Petersburg in Putin’s younger days. Arkady Rotenberg is now overseeing the construction of a bridge Putin has championed to Russia-annexed Crimea.\nFROM U.S. TREASURY STATEMENT: “Igor Rotenberg is being designated for operating in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy.
