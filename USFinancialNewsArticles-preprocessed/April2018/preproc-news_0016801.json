Her channel-agnostic expertise, coupled with her vision and conviction to building a consultancy rooted in a foundation of measurable analytics for our clients, specifically in healthcare, is essential to accelerating W2O wcg growth and exceeding client expectations,” said Jennifer Gottlieb , President of W2O. “Angela is a formidable and well-regarded force in healthcare, and her appointment to lead W2O wcg is a natural next step in the evolution of the firm.”\nPrior to rejoining the W2O family, Gillespie served as Vice President of Marketing for NeuWave Medical (acquired by J&J) and Senior Market Development Leader for Covidien’s Peripheral and Venous Vascular Business divisions.\n“As we continue to see the lines of marketing and communications blur, I am thrilled to be building a team of integrated communications and marketing professionals operating as an agency-of-record for the top healthcare companies globally,” said Gillespie. “It is essential that we help our clients navigate all sides of the strategy, marketing and communications mix in a digital world to provide best-in-class solutions that can measurably overcome complex business challenges today.”\nGillespie received a Master’s degree in communication management with an emphasis in strategic marketing from the Annenberg School at the University of Southern California and a Bachelor’s degree in speech communication and public relations from the University of Alabama.
