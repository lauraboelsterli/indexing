    "text": "TOKYO, April 20 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average was flat in choppy trade on Friday morning as worries about slower smartphone demand hit technology shares, while financial stocks rallied helped by higher U.S. yields.\nThe Nikkei was flat at 22,191.83 in midmorning trade, after trading in negative territory. For the week, the Nikkei has gained 1.7 percent and is poised to post its fourth straight week of gains.\nSemiconductor equipment companies and electronic component makers underperformed after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, revised its full-year revenue target to the low end of its previous forecast due to softer demand for smartphones.\nTokyo Electron tumbled 4.5 percent, Advantest Corp dived 4.8 percent, while Murata Manufacturing shed 2.9 percent, TDK Corp fell 2.9 percent and Alps Electric dropped 3.2 percent.\nOn the other hand, financials, which hunt for high-yielding products such as foreign bonds, outperformed after U.S. yields rose.\nInsurers Dai-ichi Life surged 3.5 percent, MS&AD Insurance gained 1.2 percent. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group added 0.7 percent.\nThe broader Topix gained 0.1 percent to 1,752.38. (Editing by Sam Holmes)\n ",
