    "text": "GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., April 17, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Mercantile Bank Corporation (NASDAQ: MBWM) (\"Mercantile\") reported net income of $10.9 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared with net income of $7.6 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, for the respective prior-year period. The successful collection of certain problem commercial loan relationships during the first quarter of 2018 increased reported net income by approximately $1.7 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, while a bank owned life insurance claim during the first quarter of 2017 increased reported net income by approximately $1.1 million, or $0.06 per diluted share; excluding the impacts of these transactions, diluted earnings per share increased $0.16, or 40.0 percent, during the current-year first quarter compared to the prior-year first quarter.\nNet income during the first three months of 2018 also benefited from a reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate, which was lowered from 35 percent to 21 percent on January 1, 2018 as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Mercantile's effective tax rate during the first quarter of 2018 was 19.0 percent, down from 30.7 percent during the prior-year first quarter.\n\"We are very pleased with our first quarter 2018 financial results, which reflect the continued success of various strategic initiatives,\" said Robert B. Kaminski, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer of Mercantile. \"Our strong financial performance reflects a robust net interest margin, controlled overhead costs, and sound asset quality. In light of our current loan pipelines and healthy financial position, we are confident that the strong operating performance achieved during the first three months of the year will continue during future periods.\"\nFirst quarter highlights include:\nStrong earnings performance and capital position Robust net interest margin Controlled overhead costs Sound asset quality, as depicted by low levels of nonperforming assets and loans in the 30- to 89-days delinquent category New commercial term loan originations of approximately $111 million Continued strength in commercial and residential loan pipelines Increased cash dividend\nOperating Results\nTotal revenue, which consists of net interest income and noninterest income, was $34.6 million during the first quarter of 2018, up $3.2 million, or 10.3 percent, from the prior-year first quarter. Net interest income during the first quarter of 2018 was $30.2 million, up $4.7 million, or 18.4 percent, from the first quarter of 2017, reflecting an increased net interest margin and a higher level of earning assets.\nThe net interest margin was 4.06 percent in the first quarter of 2018, up from 3.73 percent in the prior-year first quarter. The increase primarily resulted from a higher yield on commercial loans, mainly reflecting the positive impact of higher interest rates on variable-rate commercial loans stemming from the Federal Open Market Committee raising the targeted federal funds rate by 25 basis points in March, June, and December of 2017 and March of 2018, and successful collection efforts. The collection of interest on certain nonperforming commercial loans that paid in full positively impacted the yield on earning assets during the first quarter of 2018 by approximately 29 basis points, while a higher-than-desired level of interest-earning deposits negatively impacted the yield by approximately 8 basis points. Excluding the impacts of these factors, the net interest margin equaled approximately 3.85 percent during the first quarter of 2018. The cost of funds equaled 0.64 percent during the first quarter of 2018, up from 0.47 percent during the respective 2017 period, mainly due to increased costs of certain money market deposit accounts, time deposits, and borrowed funds.\nNet interest income and the net interest margin during the first quarter of 2018 and the prior-year first quarter were affected by purchase accounting accretion and amortization entries associated with the fair value measurements recorded effective June 1, 2014. Increases in interest income on loans totaling $2.3 million and $0.8 million were recorded during the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively. An increase in interest expense on subordinated debentures totaling $0.2 million was recorded during both the current-year first quarter and prior-year first quarter. Purchased loan accretion amounts vary from period to period as a result of periodic cash flow re-estimations, loan payoffs, and payment performance.\nMercantile recorded no provision expense during the first quarter of 2018, compared to a provision expense of $0.6 million during the respective 2017 period. No provision expense was made during the current-year first quarter in light of net loan recoveries being recorded and the lack of net loan growth. The provision expense recorded during the prior-year first quarter primarily reflected ongoing net loan growth.\nNoninterest income during the first quarter of 2018 was $4.4 million, compared to $5.9 million during the prior-year first quarter. Noninterest income during the first quarter of 2017 included a bank owned life insurance claim of $1.4 million. Excluding the impact of this transaction, noninterest income declined $0.1 million during the current-year first quarter compared to the respective 2017 period. The decline in noninterest income primarily reflected a lower level of mortgage banking activity income, which more than offset increased credit and debit card income, service charges on accounts, and payroll processing fees. Mortgage banking activity income during the first three months of 2018 was negatively impacted by a shortage of housing inventory in Mercantile's markets, most notably in West Michigan, and rising residential mortgage loan interest rates.\nNoninterest expense totaled $21.1 million during the first quarter of 2018, up $1.4 million, or 6.9 percent, from the prior-year first quarter. The higher level of expense primarily resulted from increased salary costs, mainly reflecting annual employee merit pay increases, the hiring of additional staff, a larger bonus accrual, and higher stock-based compensation expense. Increased occupancy costs, mainly stemming from expansion initiatives and higher maintenance expenses, also contributed to the increased level of noninterest expense.\nMr. Kaminski continued, \"Our core net interest margin remained strong during the first quarter of 2018, reflecting our ongoing focus on margin maintenance through prudent loan pricing and underwriting. Successful collection efforts regarding certain problem commercial loan relationships positively impacted our first quarter net interest margin by approximately 29 basis points, while an elevated level of interest-earning deposit balances negatively impacted our first quarter margin by about 8 basis points, indicating a core margin of 3.85 percent. Our net interest income benefited from the Federal Open Market Committee's three rate hikes during 2017 and the rate hike in March 2018, and based on our current balance sheet structure, we believe any additional rate increases will further enhance our net interest income. Mortgage banking activity income during the first quarter was hampered by the low level of housing inventory in our markets and the increasing rate environment; however, based on our current pipeline and record level of loan pre-qualifications, we believe that future purchase activity from increased turnover and the addition of new housing stock in our markets will more than offset lower refinance activity stemming from the rising interest rate environment, resulting in mortgage banking activity income growth in future periods.\"\nBalance Sheet\nAs of March 31, 2018, total assets were $3.29 billion, up $7.2 million, or 0.2 percent, from December 31, 2017. Interest-earning deposit balances increased $18.9 million, while total loans decreased $7.3 million over the same time period. During the twelve months ended March 31, 2018, total loans were up nearly $110 million, or 4.5 percent. Approximately $111 million in commercial term loans to new and existing borrowers were originated during the first quarter of 2018, as ongoing sales and relationship-building efforts resulted in increased lending opportunities. As of March 31, 2018, unfunded commitments on commercial construction and development loans totaled approximately $133 million, which are expected to be largely funded over the next 12 to 18 months.\nRaymond Reitsma, President of Mercantile Bank of Michigan, noted, \"We are pleased with the volume of new commercial term loan originations during the first quarter of 2018, which were comparable to the level of quarterly originations over the past several years. The commercial loan portfolio declined slightly during the first quarter, primarily reflecting an abnormally high level of payoffs; approximately $21 million in watch list credits paid off, along with about $21 million in loans in which the borrowers sold the underlying collateral or the businesses. We once again reported growth in our residential mortgage portfolio, reflecting the continuing success of strategic initiatives that were designed to increase our market presence. In light of our current loan pipelines, we believe that the commercial and residential portfolios will expand in future periods.\"\nAs of March 31, 2018, commercial and industrial loans and owner-occupied commercial real estate (\"CRE\") loans combined represented approximately 58 percent of total commercial loans, while non-owner occupied CRE loans equaled about 36 percent of total commercial loans.\nTotal deposits at March 31, 2018 were $2.54 billion, up $17.7 million and $262 million from December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively; local deposits were up $17.9 million and $205 million during the respective time periods. The growth in local deposits was mainly driven by new commercial loan relationships and the success of various deposit account initiatives. Wholesale funds were $322 million, or approximately 11 percent of total funds, as of March 31, 2018, compared to $323 million and $250 million as of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively.\nAsset Quality\nNonperforming assets at March 31, 2018 were $8.1 million, or 0.3 percent of total assets, compared to $9.4 million, or 0.3 percent of total assets, at December 31, 2017, and $7.8 million, or 0.3 percent of total assets, at March 31, 2017. Bank-owned parcels of real estate, which are no longer being used or being considered for use as bank facilities, represented approximately 26 percent of total nonperforming assets as of March 31, 2018; the parcels of real estate are expected to be sold within the next two quarters. The level of past due loans remains nominal, and loan relationships on the internal watch list have remained relatively consistent in number and dollar volume.\nNet loan recoveries were $0.5 million during the first quarter of 2018, or an annualized negative 0.08 percent of average loans, compared with net loan charge-offs of $0.3 million, or an annualized 0.05 percent of average loans, in both the linked quarter and prior-year first quarter.\nCapital Position\nShareholders' equity totaled $368 million as of March 31, 2018, an increase of $2.5 million from year-end 2017. The Bank's capital position remains above \"well-capitalized\" with a total risk-based capital ratio of 12.9 percent as of March 31, 2018, compared to 12.6 percent at December 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, the Bank had approximately $86 million in excess of the 10.0 percent minimum regulatory threshold required to be considered a \"well-capitalized\" institution. Mercantile reported 16,598,466 total shares outstanding at March 31, 2018.\nNo shares were repurchased during the first quarter of 2018 as part of the $20 million stock repurchase program that was announced in January of 2015. Future share repurchases totaling $15.5 million can be made under the program, which was expanded by $15 million in early 2016.\nMr. Kaminski concluded, \"We are well-positioned to further enrich shareholder value and meet growth goals in light of our ongoing financial strength. Our sustained cash dividend program and associated competitive dividend yield demonstrate our commitment to increasing shareholder value. As reflected by new commercial term loan originations and growth in residential mortgage loans and deposits, our focus on building and developing value-added relationships continues to successfully attract new clients as well as retain existing customers. We are excited about Mercantile's future and are confident that the strong financial results achieved during the first quarter of 2018 will continue in the current year and beyond.\"\nAbout Mercantile Bank Corporation\nBased in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Mercantile Bank Corporation is the bank holding company for Mercantile Bank of Michigan.
