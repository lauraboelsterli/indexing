Net revenues for the first quarter were $103.1 million, a decrease of five percent from the prior quarter and a decrease of two percent from the first quarter of 2017. Net income for the quarter was $14.2 million or $0.46 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $0.57 per share in the prior quarter and net income of $0.47 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017. Cash flow from operations was $15.7 million for the quarter.\nIn addition to its GAAP results, the company provided certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, the tax effects of these items, and a charge incurred in the fourth quarter of 2017 in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $20.4 million or $0.67 per diluted share, compared with $0.74 per diluted share in the prior quarter and $0.63 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017.\nCommented Balu Balakrishnan, president and CEO of Power Integrations: “First-quarter revenues were consistent with our expectations, while gross margins exceeded our projections due mainly to a favorable end-market mix. Bookings strengthened compared with the prior quarter, and we expect healthy sequential revenue growth in the second quarter.”\nAdditional Highlights\nPower Integrations repurchased approximately 498,000 shares of its common stock during the first quarter, utilizing $33.3 million. The company had $41.1 million remaining on its repurchase authorization at quarter-end. The company paid a dividend of $0.16/share on March 30, 2018. A dividend of $0.16/ share is scheduled for June 29, 2018, to stockholders of record as of May 31, 2018. Power Integrations was issued 10 U.S. patents during the first quarter of 2018.\nFinancial Outlook\nThe company issued the following forecast for the second quarter of 2018:\nRevenues are expected to be $109 million plus or minus $3 million. GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 51 percent; non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 52 percent. (The difference between the expected GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins is composed of approximately 0.7 percentage points from amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and 0.3 percentage points from stock-based compensation.) GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $41.5 million; non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $35 million. (Non-GAAP expenses are expected to exclude approximately $6 million of stock-based compensation and $0.5 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.)\nConference Call Today at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time\nPower Integrations management will hold a conference call today at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time. Members of the investment community can join the call by dialing 1-647-689-4187. The call will also be available on the investor section of the company's website, http://investors.power.com .\nAbout Power Integrations\nPower Integrations, Inc. is a leading innovator in semiconductor technologies for high-voltage power conversion. The company’s products are key building blocks in the clean-power ecosystem, enabling the generation of renewable energy as well as the efficient transmission and consumption of power in applications ranging from milliwatts to megawatts. For more information please visit www.power.com .\nNote Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to the company's consolidated financial statements, which are presented according to GAAP, the company provides certain non-GAAP financial information that excludes stock-based compensation expenses recorded under ASC 718-10, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets (including in-place lease intangible assets), the tax effects of these items, and a charge related to the 2017 tax legislation. The company uses these measures in its financial and operational decision-making and, with respect to one measure, in setting performance targets for compensation purposes. The company believes that these non-GAAP measures offer important analytical tools to help investors understand its operating results, and to facilitate comparability with the results of companies that provide similar measures. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools and are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial information. For example, stock-based compensation is an important component of the company’s compensation mix, and will continue to result in significant expenses in the company’s GAAP results for the foreseeable future, but is not reflected in the non-GAAP measures. Also, other companies, including companies in Power Integrations’ industry, may calculate non-GAAP measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures are attached to this press release.\nNote Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThe statements in this press release regarding the company’s expectations and forecast for its second-quarter financial performance are reflecting management's current expectations and beliefs. These are based on current information that is, by its nature, subject to rapid and even abrupt change. Due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, actual results could differ materially from those projected or implied by these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: changes in global macroeconomic conditions, which may impact the level of demand for the company’s products; potential changes and shifts in customer demand away from end products that utilize the company's integrated circuits to end products that do not incorporate the company's products; the effects of competition, which may cause the company’s revenues to decrease or cause the company to decrease its selling prices for its products; the outcome and cost of patent litigation, which may affect sales of the company’s products or could result in higher expenses and charges than currently expected; unforeseen costs and expenses; and unfavorable fluctuations in component costs or operating expenses resulting from changes in commodity prices and/or exchange rates. In addition, new product introductions and design wins are subject to the risks and uncertainties that typically accompany development and delivery of complex technologies to the marketplace, including product development delays and defects and market acceptance of the new products. These and other risk factors that may cause actual results to differ are more fully explained under the caption “Risk Factors” in the company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 14, 2018. The company is under no obligation (and expressly disclaims any obligation) to update or alter its , whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nPower Integrations and the Power Integrations logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of Power Integrations, Inc.\nPOWER INTEGRATIONS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(in thousands, except per-share amounts) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 NET REVENUES $ 103,081 $ 108,249 $ 104,688 COST OF REVENUES 49,537 54,221 54,212 GROSS PROFIT 53,544 54,028 50,476 OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 17,481 17,180 16,640 Sales and marketing 12,574 12,743 11,633 General and administrative 9,014 9,127 8,704 Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 514 513 583 Total operating expenses 39,583 39,563 37,560 INCOME FROM OPERATIONS 13,961 14,465 12,916 Other income, net 836 796 506 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 14,797 15,261 13,422 PROVISION (BENEFIT) FOR INCOME TAXES 597 32,159 (677 ) NET INCOME (LOSS) $ 14,200 $ (16,898 ) $ 14,099 EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE: Basic $ 0.48 $ (0.57 ) $ 0.48 Diluted $ 0.46 $ (0.57 ) $ 0.47 SHARES USED IN PER-SHARE CALCULATION: Basic 29,799 29,759 29,456 Diluted 30,552 29,759 30,248 SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: Stock-based compensation expenses included in: Cost of revenues $ 249 $ 436 $ 143 Research and development 1,839 2,338 1,634 Sales and marketing 1,276 1,470 1,097 General and administrative 2,261 2,611 2,095 Total stock-based compensation expense $ 5,625 $ 6,855 $ 4,969 Cost of revenues includes: Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets $ 813 $ 939 $ 939 General & administrative expenses include: Patent-litigation expenses $ 1,897 $ 1,914 $ 1,844 Other income, net includes: Amortization of in-place lease intangible assets $ -
