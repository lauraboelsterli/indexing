Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 rose by $499,000, or 11.55%.\nFully diluted earnings per share rose by $0.05, or 10.87%, to $0.51 for the three months ending March 31, 2018 from $0.46 for the three months ending March 31, 2017. Return on average assets and return on average equity was 0.97% and 8.31% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to 0.92% and 7.53% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Interest income on loans for the three months ended March 31, 2018 grew by $1.39 million, or 10.32%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. Deposits rose by 4.25% in the first three months of 2018 to $1.665 billion at March 31, 2018. Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share, representing Territorial Bancorp Inc.’s 34th consecutive quarterly dividend.\nHONOLULU, April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Territorial Bancorp Inc. (NASDAQ:TBNK) (the “Company”), headquartered in Honolulu, Hawaii, the holding company parent of Territorial Savings Bank, announced net income of $4.82 million or $0.51 per diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $4.32 million or $0.46 per diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nThe Company also announced that its Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share. The dividend is expected to be paid on May 24, 2018 to stockholders of record as of May 10, 2018.\nAllan Kitagawa, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “The Company’s solid performance in the first quarter is a result of our ongoing efforts to increase the size of our loan portfolio by focusing on originating residential mortgage loans. The continued growth of Hawaii’s economy, especially the visitor industry, has allowed us to increase the size of our loan portfolio and total deposits. Our asset quality and capital remain strong. We are also pleased to announce our 34 th consecutive quarterly dividend, which will be paid to our shareholders on May 24 th .”\nInterest Income\nNet interest income after provision for loan losses increased to $15.23 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $14.59 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of 4.39%. Total interest income was $18.23 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $16.78 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The $1.45 million growth in interest income was due to a $1.39 million increase in interest earned on loans, which resulted primarily from the $141.42 million increase in the average balance of loans receivable for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nInterest Expense and Provision for Loan Losses\nTotal interest expense increased to $3.00 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $2.12 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Total interest expense on deposits increased to $2.45 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $1.65 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in interest expense on deposits occurred primarily because of the $110.56 million growth in the average balance of total deposits for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017 and an increase in the cost of certificates of deposits. During the three months ending March 31, 2018, The Bank obtained $61.51 million of certificates of deposit from state and local governments with terms greater than two years. These deposits were used to reduce interest rate risk in a rising interest rate environment by extending the maturity of fixed-rate deposits. Interest expense on advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) increased to $419,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $254,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in interest expense on FHLB advances was primarily due to a $29.29 million increase in the average balance of FHLB advances for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. These additional borrowings were used to reduce interest rate risk in a rising interest rate environment by extending the maturity of fixed-rate borrowings and to fund the growth in loans receivable.\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the provision for loan losses was $9,000 compared to $71,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The reduction in loan loss provisions is due to a reduction in nonperforming loans and relatively low levels of loan losses.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income was $742,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $1.02 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to a $141,000 decrease in service fees on loans and deposit accounts and a $95,000 decrease in the gain on sale of investment securities.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense was $9.39 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $8.71 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to a $564,000 increase in salaries and employee benefits that occurred because of a decrease in the capitalized cost of new loan originations and an increase in the minimum average hourly wage rate to $15.00 an hour. As new loans are originated, the Company capitalizes the cost of new loan originations and reduces the salary expense attributable to such originations. The Company originated fewer loans in the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The reduction in the number of loans originated lowered the capitalized cost of new loan originations and raised compensation expense. Starting on January 1, 2018, Territorial Savings Bank also raised the minimum hourly wage rate it pays to $15.00 an hour, to share the benefits it will receive from the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate from 35.00% in 2017 to 21.00% effective for 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $1.76 million compared to $2.58 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The reduction in income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is due to the reduction of the federal corporate tax rate from 35.00% in 2017 to 21.00%, effective January 1, 2018.\nAssets and Equity\nTotal assets increased to $2.056 billion at March 31, 2018 from $2.004 billion at December 31, 2017. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $33.02 million to $65.11 million at March 31, 2018. Loans receivable grew by $16.09 million to $1.505 billion at March 31, 2018 from $1.489 billion at March 31, 2017 as residential mortgage loan originations exceeded loan repayments and sales. The growth in loans receivable was funded primarily by a $67.88 million increase in deposits. Deposits increased by 4.25% to $1.665 billion at March 31, 2018 from $1.597 billion at March 31, 2017. Total stockholder’s equity decreased to $232.37 million at March 31, 2018 from $234.85 million at March 31, 2017. The decrease in stockholders’ equity occurred as the Company completed its seventh share repurchase program and paid dividends to stockholders. The decrease in stockholders’ equity which occurred because of the completion of the share repurchase program and the payment of dividends was partially offset by the Company’s net income for the first quarter.\nCapital Management\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company completed its seventh repurchase program. The Company repurchased 227,900 shares of its common stock at an average price of $29.95 per share. The Company uses share repurchases as part of its overall program to enhance stockholder value. The Company will continue to closely monitor this issue and, depending on market and other conditions, will conduct repurchases when it makes financial sense.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company has 393,535 outstanding, exercisable stock options. The exercise of options would increase the number of shares outstanding, which among other things, would reduce earnings per share.\nAsset Quality\nTotal delinquent loans 90 days or more past due and not accruing totaled $1.02 million (4 loans) at March 31, 2018, compared to $1.67 million (5 loans) at December 31, 2017. Non-performing assets totaled $2.62 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $4.23 million at December 31, 2017. The ratio of non-performing assets to total assets decreased to 0.13% at March 31, 2018 from 0.21% at December 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $2.55 million and represented 0.17% of total loans.\nAbout Us\nTerritorial Bancorp Inc., headquartered in Honolulu, Hawaii, is the stock holding company for Territorial Savings Bank.
