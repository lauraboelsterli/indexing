    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - Shares in Portuguese energy and utility group EDP ( EDP.LS ) rose on Monday after France’s BFM Business reported on its website that French utility Engie ( ENGIE.PA ) was examining a possible bid for EDP.\nFILE PHOTO: Banners bearing the logo of Energias de Portugal (EDP) are seen at the company headquarters in Lisbon, Portugal, December 13, 2011. REUTERS/Jose Manuel Ribeiro/FILE PHOTO Engie said it had no comment to make on the BFM Business report, which Quote: d sources close to Engie.\nEDP shares were up 5.4 percent at 3.23 euros in early session trading, while Engie shares fell 0.5 percent.\nAt that price, EDP has a stock market capitalization of around 11.7 billion euros ($14.4 billion), while Engie has a market capitalization of around 33 billion euros.\nThe European utilities sector received a jolt last month when Germany’s top utilities announced plans to break up Innogy ( IGY.DE ), whose assets will be divided among parent RWE ( RWEG.DE ) and rival E.ON EONGnDE.\nBFM Business added that any final decision as to whether or not to go ahead with a bid would not be made until Engie’s new boss Jean-Pierre Clamadieu formally took up his position in May.\nClamadieu had said in February that Engie should consider acquisition opportunities.\nLast month, Engie said its three-year transformation plan had been completed ahead of schedule, as it returned to profit after two years of losses and posted a higher-than-expected dividend.\nReporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta and Jean-Michel Belot; Editing by Keith Weir\n ",
