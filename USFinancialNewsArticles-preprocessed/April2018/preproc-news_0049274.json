    "text": "MIDLAND, Mich., April 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Chemical Financial Corporation (\"Chemical,\" \"we,\" \"us\" or \"our\") (NASDAQ:CHFC) today announced 2018 first quarter net income of $70.2 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, compared to 2017 fourth quarter net income of $9.4 million, or $0.13 per diluted share and 2017 first quarter net income of $47.6 million, or $0.67 per diluted share. Fourth quarter of 2017 net income, excluding significant items, a non-GAAP financial measure, which for the fourth quarter of 2017 excluded the charge to income tax expense of $46.7 million resulting from the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets, $2.6 million of merger and restructuring expenses and $7.6 million of losses on sales of investment securities was $62.7 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, and first quarter of 2017 net income, excluding significant items, which for the first quarter of 2017 excluded $4.2 million of merger expenses was $50.3 million, or $0.70 per diluted share. (1) We had no significant items . In addition, on April 24, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a second quarter of 2018 dividend on our common stock of $0.28 per share. The second quarter of 2018 dividend will be payable on June 15, 2018, to shareholders of record on June 1, 2018.\n\"We are pleased with our earnings results for the quarter which benefited from an increase in net interest income driven by improvement in our net interest margin, a $3.8 million benefit to earnings due to a change in fair value in loan servicing rights and a lower effective tax rate,\" noted David T. Provost, Chief Executive Officer of Chemical and Thomas C. Shafer, Vice Chairman of Chemical and Chief Executive Office of Chemical Bank. \"Over the last few months we have successfully recruited who we believe to be some of the top commercial lenders in our markets and made investments in banking teams in our high growth areas. Additionally, we have keenly focused on growing our core deposits and are pleased with the progress we are making with both retail and institutional customers. Furthermore, our teams are working diligently to implement substantial upgrades to our core operating systems and are on schedule to complete this project in the third quarter of this year. We look forward to the growth we believe these investments will bring to our loan and deposit portfolios in addition to the optimal best-in-class customer service experience we are creating for our customers.\"\nOur return on average assets was 1.44% during the first quarter of 2018, compared to 0.20% during the fourth quarter of 2017 and 1.09% in the first quarter of 2017. Our return on average assets, excluding significant items, a non-GAAP financial measure, was 1.31% during the fourth quarter of 2017 and 1.15% in the first quarter of 2017. (1) Our return on average tangible shareholders' equity was 18.6% , compared to 2.5% during the fourth quarter of 2017 and 13.3% in the first quarter of 2017. Our return on average tangible equity, excluding significant items, a non-GAAP financial measure, was 16.5% during the fourth quarter of 2017 and 14.1% in the first quarter of 2017. (1)\nOur net interest income was $151.9 million , $6.0 million, or 4.1%, higher than the fourth quarter of 2017 and $21.8 million, or 16.7%, higher than the first quarter of 2017. The increase in net interest income , compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, was primarily attributable to increases in yields earned and average balances on loans and investment securities, partially offset by two less days in the quarter. The increase in net interest income , over the first quarter of 2017, was primarily attributable to increases in average balances and yields earned on loans in addition to an increase in average investment securities. We experienced net loan growth of $63.5 million during the first quarter of 2018 and $945.4 million during the twelve months ended March 31, 2018, and increased our investment securities portfolio by $333.3 million during the first quarter of 2018 and $1.05 billion during the twelve months ended March 31, 2018.\nOur net interest margin was 3.51% , compared to 3.39% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 3.41% in the first quarter of 2017. Our net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP financial measure, was 3.56% , compared to 3.47% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 3.49% in the first quarter of 2017. (1) Our net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, , compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, improved primarily due to increases in yields earned and average balances in our loan and investment securities portfolios, partially offset by an increase in our cost of funds and the reduced benefit of the fully taxable equivalent adjustment resulting from the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate to 21%. The average yield on our loan portfolio increased to 4.48% , compared to 4.31% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 4.11% in the first quarter of 2017. Interest accretion from purchase accounting discounts on acquired loans contributed 29 basis points to our net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, , compared to 22 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 12 basis points in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in the size of our investment securities portfolio was primarily due to our reinvestment of the proceeds from our fourth quarter of 2017 sales of certain securities in a loss position as part of our treasury and tax management objectives and additional investment in our investment securities portfolio. Our average cost of funds was 0.64% , compared to 0.56% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 0.35% in the first quarter of 2017.\nOur provision for loan losses was $6.3 million , compared to $7.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $4.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in the provision for loan losses , compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, was primarily the result of a reduction in originated loan growth. We recorded all acquired loans at their estimated fair value at each respective acquisition date without a carryover of the related allowance and, as of both March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we determined no allowance was needed for this population of loans.\nNet loan charge-offs were $3.4 million, or 0.10% of average loans, , compared to $1.4 million, or 0.04% of average loans, in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $3.5 million, or 0.11% of average loans, in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in charge-offs , compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, was primarily due to charge-offs taken on loans individually evaluated for impairment with previously established specific reserves.\nOur nonperforming loans totaled $61.8 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $63.1 million at December 31, 2017 and $47.8 million at March 31, 2017. Nonperforming loans comprised 0.43% of total loans at March 31, 2018, compared to 0.45% at December 31, 2017 and 0.36% at March 31, 2017.\nOur allowance for loan losses for our originated loan portfolio was $94.8 million, or 0.95% of originated loans, at March 31, 2018, compared to $91.9 million, or 0.94% of originated loans, at December 31, 2017 and $78.8 million, or 0.99% of originated loans, at March 31, 2017. Our allowance for loan losses of our originated loan portfolio as a percentage of nonperforming loans was 153.3% at March 31, 2018, compared to 145.6% at December 31, 2017 and 164.7% at March 31, 2017. The results of our quarterly re-estimation of cash flows on our acquired loan portfolios resulted in no need for an allowance for our acquired loan portfolios as of March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 or March 31, 2017.\nOur noninterest income was $40.6 million , compared to $32.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $38.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Noninterest income increased compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to $7.6 million in losses in the fourth quarter of 2017 on the sale of investment securities taken as part of our treasury and tax management objectives and a $4.6 million increase in net gain on sale of loans and other mortgage banking revenue, partially offset by a $1.8 million decrease in other charges and fees for customer services. Noninterest income increased compared to the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to a $3.4 million increase in net gain on sale of loans and other mortgage banking revenue and a $1.8 million increase in other noninterest income, partially offset by a $3.1 million decrease in other charges and fees for customer services. Net gain on sale of loans and other mortgage banking revenue, included a $3.8 million benefit to earnings due to a change in fair value in loan servicing rights , compared to a $13 thousand detriment in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a $519 thousand detriment in the first quarter of 2017. The change in fair value in loan servicing rights benefited diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.04 , compared to no impact in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a detriment of $0.01 in the first quarter of 2017.\nOur operating expenses were $103.4 million , compared to $100.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $104.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. We had no merger and restructuring expenses , compared to $2.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $4.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. First quarter of 2018 included $1.6 million of impairment related to a federal historic tax credit placed into service during the quarter, included within other operating expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income, compared to $6.2 million of impairment related to federal historic tax credits in the fourth quarter of 2017. Core operating expenses, a non-GAAP financial measure, which excludes merger and restructuring expenses for 2017 and the impairment of federal historic tax credits, were $101.7 million , compared to $91.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $10.4 million, primarily due to an $8.7 million increase in salaries, wages and employee benefits and a $2.3 million increase in outside processing and service fees primarily due to costs incurred related to preparing for the conversion of our core operating system. The increase in salaries, wages and employee benefits was the result of annual merit increases, the hiring of additional lenders, key management and operations staff, an increase in payroll taxes due to the additional salary expense, the beginning of a new tax year and a decrease in the deferral of loan origination costs due to lower loan production. Costs specifically attributed to our efforts to implement upgrades to our core operating systems were $2.7 million . These costs are expected to increase for the second quarter of 2018 and then begin trending downward for the third and fourth quarters of 2018.\nOur effective tax rate was 15.3% , compared to 86.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 20.5% in the first quarter of 2017. Our tax rate benefited from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which reduced the federal corporate tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018 and a $1.6 million benefit from a federal housing tax credit placed into service during the quarter. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 was impacted by the $46.7 million charge to income tax expense as a result of the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets and the $6.2 million benefit from federal historic tax credits placed into service during the quarter. Our tax rate for the first quarter of 2017 benefited primarily from stock option exercises that occurred during the quarter.\nOur efficiency ratio is a measure of operating expenses as a percentage of net interest income and noninterest income. Our efficiency ratio was 53.7% , compared to 56.1% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 62.0% in the first quarter of 2017. Our adjusted efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure, which excludes, as applicable, amortization of intangibles, merger and restructuring expenses, impairment of income tax credits, the net interest income FTE adjustment, the change in fair value on loan servicing rights, and losses/gains from sale of investment securities, was 52.5% , compared to 47.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 57.4% in the first quarter of 2017. (1)\nOur total assets were $19.76 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $19.28 billion at December 31, 2017 and $17.64 billion at March 31, 2017. The increase in our total assets during the first quarter of 2018 was primarily attributable to an increase in our investment securities portfolio. The increase in total assets during the twelve months ended March 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to an increase in our investment securities portfolio and net loan growth.\nOur investment securities portfolio totaled $2.97 billion at March 31, 2018, an increase of $333.3 million, compared to $2.64 billion at December 31, 2017, and an increase of $1.05 billion, compared to $1.92 billion at March 31, 2017. The increase in the investment securities portfolio in both the first quarter of 2018 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2018 reflects our long-term plan to increase our investment securities portfolio as a percentage of total assets. The increase in our investment securities portfolio also includes the remaining reinvestment of proceeds from our sales of certain securities in a loss position in the fourth quarter of 2017 as part of our treasury and tax management objectives.\nOur total loans were $14.22 billion at March 31, 2018, an increase of $63.5 million, from total loans of $14.16 billion at December 31, 2017 and an increase of $945.4 million, from total loans of $13.27 billion at March 31, 2017. We experienced organic loan growth of $265.1 million during the first quarter of 2018, compared to $591.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $501.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. Growth in our originated loan portfolio was partially offset by run-off in our acquired loan portfolio of $201.6 million , compared to $269.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $218.8 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nOur total deposits were $13.97 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $13.64 billion at December 31, 2017 and $13.13 billion at March 31, 2017. The increase in deposits during the three months ended March 31, 2018 was primarily due to an increase in brokered deposits, noninterest-bearing demand accounts and money market accounts. Collateralized customer deposits were $490.1 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $415.2 million at December 31, 2017 and $398.9 million at March 31, 2017. Loans as a percentage of deposits plus collateralized customer deposits were 98.3% at March 31, 2018, compared to 100.7% at December 31, 2017 and 98.1% at March 31, 2017.\nOur short-term borrowings were $2.05 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $2.00 billion at December 31, 2017 and $900.0 million at March 31, 2017 and consisted of short-term FHLB advances that we used to fund our short-term liquidity needs. Our long-term borrowings were $372.9 million at both March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, compared to $490.9 million at March 31, 2017.\nOur shareholders' equity to total assets ratio was 13.7% at March 31, 2018, compared to 13.8% at December 31, 2017 and 14.7% at March 31, 2017. Our tangible shareholders' equity to tangible assets ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure, and total risk-based capital ratio were 8.3% and 11.2% (estimated), respectively, at March 31, 2018 compared to 8.3% and 11.0%, respectively, at December 31, 2017 and 8.8% and 11.4%, respectively, at March 31, 2017. (1) Our book value was $37.89 per share at March 31, 2018, compared to $37.48 per share at December 31, 2017 and $36.56 per share at March 31, 2017. Our tangible book value, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $21.66 per share at March 31, 2018, compared to $21.21 per share at December 31, 2017 and $20.32 per share at March 31, 2017.

Such non-GAAP financial measures including measures that exclude significant items, net income, diluted earnings per share, return on average assets and return on average shareholders' equity, our tangible equity to tangible assets ratio, tangible book value per share, presentation of net interest income and net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis, core operating expenses (which excludes merger and restructuring expenses and impairment of income tax credits), operating expenses-efficiency ratio (which excludes merger and restructuring expenses, impairment of federal historic tax credits and amortization of intangibles), and the adjusted efficiency ratio (which excludes significant items, impairment of federal historic tax credits, loan servicing rights change in fair value gains (losses), amortization of intangibles, net interest income FTE adjustments, (losses) gains from sale of investment securities and closed branch locations).\nThese non-GAAP financial measures have been included because we believe they are helpful for investors to analyze and evaluate our financial condition. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. In addition, because non-GAAP measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare the non-GAAP historical measures in this press release with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure may be found in the financial tables included with this press release.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements that are based on management's beliefs, assumptions, current expectations, estimates and projections about the financial services industry, the economy and Chemical.

These statements include, among others, statements related to our belief regarding our recruitment of top commercial lenders, the impact of upgrades to our core operating systems, the timing of such upgrades and our expected costs attributable to such upgrades, including the timing and impact of such expenses. All statements referencing future time periods are forward-looking.\nManagement's determination of the provision and allowance for loan losses; the carrying value of acquired loans, goodwill and mortgage servicing rights; the fair value of investment securities (including whether any impairment on any investment security is temporary or other-than-temporary and the amount of any impairment); and management's assumptions concerning pension and other postretirement benefit plans involve judgments that are inherently forward-looking. There can be no assurance that future loan losses will be limited to the amounts estimated. All of the information concerning interest rate sensitivity is forward-looking. The future effect of changes in the financial and credit markets and the national and regional economies on the banking industry, generally, and on Chemical, specifically, are also inherently uncertain.\nForward-looking statements are based upon current beliefs and expectations and involve substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, such statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions (\"risk factors\") that are difficult to predict with regard to timing, extent, likelihood and degree of occurrence. Therefore, actual results and outcomes may materially differ from what may be expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update, amend or clarify forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Risk factors include, without limitation, a downturn in the economy, particularly in our markets, volatile credit and financial markets both domestic and foreign, potential deterioration in real estate value, operational and regulatory challenges associated with our information technology systems and policies and procedures in light of our rapid growth and pending system conversion in 2018, regulatory changes, excessive loan losses, our inability to attract and retain new commercial lenders and other bankers as well as key operations staff in light of competition for experienced employees in the banking industry, our inability to execute on its strategy to expand investments and commercial lending, our inability to grow our deposits after reducing the number of physical branches that we operate, and negative reactions to our restructuring efforts by our customers, employees and other counterparties.\nIn addition, risk factors include, but are not limited to, the risk factors described in Item 1A of Chemical's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
