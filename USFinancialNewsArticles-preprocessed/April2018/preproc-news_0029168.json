The effective cash tax rate is calculated by dividing cash taxes paid by pre-tax income excluding special charges and MTM gains on equity investments. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2018, the effective cash tax rate was 0.5%.\n(b)\nThe purpose of this adjustment is to capitalize the impact of aircraft operating leases. The company uses a multiple of seven times its annual aircraft rent expense to estimate the potential capitalized value and related liability of its aircraft. This is a simplified method used by many rating agencies and financial analysts to assist with the impact of operating leases on financial measures like return on invested capital.\n(c)\nNon-interest bearing liabilities include advance ticket sales, frequent flyer deferred revenue, deferred income taxes and other non-interest bearing liabilities.\nUNITED CONTINENTAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL RECONCILIATION\n(A) UAL evaluates its financial performance utilizing various accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and Non-GAAP financial measures, including operating income (loss), excluding special charges, operating margin excluding special charges, pre-tax income (loss), excluding special charges and MTM gains and losses on equity investments, pre-tax margin, excluding special charges and MTM gains and losses on equity investments, net income (loss), excluding special charges and MTM gains and losses on equity investments, diluted earnings (loss) per share, excluding special charges and MTM gains and losses on equity investments, and CASM, excluding special charges, third-party business expenses, fuel, and profit sharing, among others. UAL believes that adjusting for special charges is useful to investors because special charges are charges not indicative of UAL's ongoing performance. UAL believes that adjusting for MTM gains and losses on equity investments is useful to investors because those unrealized gains or losses may not ultimately be realized on a cash basis.\nCASM is a common metric used in the airline industry to measure an airline's cost structure and efficiency. UAL reports CASM excluding special charges, third-party business expenses, fuel and profit sharing. UAL believes that adjusting for special charges is useful to investors because special charges are charges not indicative of UAL's ongoing performance. UAL also believes that excluding third-party business expenses, such as maintenance, ground handling and catering services for third parties, and fuel sales, provides more meaningful disclosure because these expenses are not directly related to UAL's core business. UAL also believes that excluding fuel costs from certain measures is useful to investors because it provides an additional measure of management's performance excluding the effects of a significant cost item over which management has limited influence. UAL excludes profit sharing because this exclusion allows investors to better understand and analyze our operating cost performance and provides a more meaningful comparison of our core operating costs to the airline industry.

In the first quarter of 2017, approximately 1,000 technicians and related employees elected to voluntarily separate from the company and will receive a severance payment, with a maximum value of $100,000 per participant, based on years of service, with retirement dates through early 2019. Also during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, the company recorded $6 million ($4 million net of taxes) and $16 million ($10 million net of taxes), respectively, of severance related to its management reorganization initiative.\nImpairment of assets: During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the company recorded a $23 million ($17 million net of taxes) fair value adjustment for aircraft purchased off lease and impairments related to certain fleet types and certain international slots no longer in use.\nMTM gains on equity investments: During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the company recorded a gain of $45 million ($35 million net of taxes) for the change in market value of its investment in Azul, S.A. For equity investments subject to MTM accounting, the company records gains and losses to Nonoperating income (expense): Miscellaneous, net in its statements of consolidated operations.\n(D) Effective tax rate\nThe company's effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was 20.3% and 33.6%, respectively. The effective tax rates represented a blend of federal, state and foreign taxes and included the impact of certain nondeductible items. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 also reflects the reduced federal corporate income tax rate as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\") in December 2017 and the impact of a change in the mix of domestic and foreign earnings. We continue to analyze the different aspects of the Tax Act which could potentially affect the provisional estimates that were recorded at December 31, 2017.\n with multimedia: releases/united-airlines-reports-first-quarter-2018-performance-300631634.html\nSOURCE United Airlines",
