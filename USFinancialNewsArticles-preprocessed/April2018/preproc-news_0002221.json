FILE PHOTO: A logo of French retailer Casino is pictured outside a Casino supermarket in Nantes, France, July 20, 2017. REUTERS/Stephane Mahe/File Photo \nThe companies said on Tuesday that they were in talks to jointly negotiate purchases with their main, multi-national food and non-food suppliers. \nCasino’s planned partnership with Auchan in this area comes just a week after it struck a deal with Amazon ( AMZN.O ). \nCasino and Amazon said last week that groceries sourced from Casino’s Monoprix supermarket arm would be available through the Amazon Prime Now app and website. \nAmazon’s purchase of the bricks-and-mortar retailer Whole Foods Market Inc for $13.7 billion (£9.7 billion) last year, along with a deal for Amazon Prime to sell products from the British supermarket chain Morrisons ( MRW.L ), have led to speculation that Amazon could bid for a retailer or form a partnership in France. \nCasino already has another delivery partnership with UK online retailer Ocado ( OCDO.L ), signed last year. \nIn January, Casino’s French rival Carrefour ( CARR.PA ) also said it would seek a partnership in China with Tencent ( 0700.HK ) in the face of competition from Amazon.
