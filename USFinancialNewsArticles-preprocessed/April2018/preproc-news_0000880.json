    "text": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., April 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OmniComm Systems, Inc. (OmniComm) (OTCQX:OMCM), a global leading provider of clinical data management technology, today announced record financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n“I am very pleased with our 2017 results,” said Stephen Johnson, chief executive officer and president of OmniComm. “It was a year of record revenue and major milestones. We experienced significant growth, especially in Europe and Asia, reached the 6,000 clinical trial mark, announced the release of two new products, IRTMaster™ and AutoEncoder, and acquired a market-leading business intelligence platform, Acuity ® for data analytics. We also had continued success with our two core products, TrialMaster ® and TrialOne ® . The expansion of our product offering, coupled with our emergence internationally, well positions us for another strong year in 2018.”\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, OmniComm reported record revenue of $27.0 million, a 6% increase over the prior year’s revenue of $25.4 million. Gross margin improved by 8% to $21.7 million. Operating expenses increased by 14% or $2.3 million to $18.2 million, which resulted in operating income of $3.5 million. EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure OmniComm uses as an additional financial measure, was $3.9 million.\nOmniComm provides EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure as additional information to its financial results. Non-GAAP EBITDA excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses that are included in operating income. Non-GAAP EBITDA is not an alternative or substitute for the financial measure prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) of operating income. The non-GAAP EBITDA financial measure presented may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define this non-GAAP financial measure in the same way. OmniComm’s management uses non-GAAP EBITDA as a measure of operational efficiency and as a goal for incentive compensation. Management believes non-GAAP EBITDA is a useful measure investors may use as an additional factor in their analysis of OmniComm’s performance. Please review the below reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure EBITDA to the GAAP financial measure operating income, as well as OmniComm’s financial statements as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nOMNICOMM SYSTEMS, INC.

We wish to caution the reader that these forward-looking statements regarding matters that are not historical facts are only predictions and are based on information available at the time and/or management's good faith belief with respect to future events. No assurance can be given that plans for the future will be consummated or that the future results indicated, whether expressed or implied, will be achieved. While sometimes presented with numerical specificity, these plans and projections and other forward-looking statements are based upon a variety of assumptions, which we consider reasonable, but which nevertheless may not be realized. Because of the number and range of the assumptions underlying our projections and forward-looking statements, many of which are subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies that are beyond our reasonable control, some of the assumptions inevitably will not materialize, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur subsequent to the date of this press release. Therefore, our actual experience and results achieved during the period covered by any particular projections or forward-looking statements may differ substantially from those projected. Consequently, the inclusion of projections and other forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that these plans will be consummated or that estimates and projections will be realized, and actual results may vary materially. There can be no assurance that any of these expectations will be realized or that any of the forward-looking statements contained herein will prove to be accurate. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statement was made. OmniComm does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement made by it or on its behalf, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nOMNICOMM SYSTEMS, INC.
