    "text": "April 2, 2018 / 3:34 PM / Updated 22 minutes ago Frontera Energy names new CEO, will double investment in Colombia, Peru Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nBOGOTA, April 2 (Reuters) - Canadaâ€™s Frontera Energy Corp named a new chief executive on Monday, and said it plans to more than double its investment in operations in Colombia and Peru during 2018, to up to $500 million. \nFrontera will direct between $225 million and $240 million of investment to new wells and maintenance in the two countries, the company said in a statement. \nThe investment will fund between 125 and 135 development wells, 11 to 15 exploratory wells and 15 to 25 work-over wells, the company said. Work-over wells require major maintenance or remedial treatment. \nRichard Herbert, formerly of BP Plc, will replace Barry Larson as chief executive. At BP, Herbert was responsible for exploration and development projects worldwide, Frontera said. \nFrontera had an average daily production of 70,082 barrels of crude per day (bpd) in 2017, the statement said, down 32 percent from 2016 because of the end of its contract to operate Rubiales field, its top producer. The company aims to produce between 65,000 and 70,000 bpd this year, it said. \nBased on a Brent oil price of $63 per barrel, the company anticipates 2018 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of between $375 million and $425 million, it said. \nFrontera had a net loss of $217 million in 2017, compared with net profit of $2.4 billion in 2016, the company said by telephone.
