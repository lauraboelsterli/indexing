The purchase of the system adds approximately 1,125 new customers to the Company’s customer base in the Peoria District and serves a population of about 2,500 residents.\nThe Farmington City Council voted in favor of the sale in March 2017 and the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) approved the sale for $3.75 million on March 21, 2018. Today, Illinois American Water acquired the water system.\n“We look forward to investing in the City of Farmington and ensuring quality water service to our new customers,” said Hauk.\nCity of Farmington Mayor Kent Kowal also supports the acquisition. He said, “We welcome Illinois American Water and look forward to their team helping us meet our water service needs. Their knowledge and ability to upgrade our aging water system is critical to our community’s economic future.”\nIllinois American Water will invest $5 million in the first five years of ownership. This investment will include a hydraulic study to be completed in 2018 with a focus on improving water pressure and fire flow. Investment will also include GIS updates and meter exchanges. In coming years, Illinois American Water will focus on water main replacements and installations to loop water mains.\nRoger Goodson, sr. manager of field operations and production for the Peoria District, said, “We are excited to become a member of this vibrant community, not only as the water service provider, but as a good neighbor.”\nNew customers will soon receive an Illinois American Water welcome packet in the mail. This packet includes information about online account management, billing and more.\nThe appraisal process used for the Farmington water system was conducted under the supervision of the ICC and established as part of the Illinois Water Systems Viability Act. According to Hauk, this law gives communities an alternative to value their water and/or wastewater system when considering being acquired by an investor-owned water utility. He said, “Previous law only allowed the investor-owned water or sewer utility to pay the original cost minus depreciation to acquire a small system, public or private. Because of this, systems were deprived of receiving adequate value for their system.”\nThe City of Farmington will be incorporated into the company’s Peoria District, which currently serves residents in Peoria, West Peoria, Bartonville, Bellevue, Rome, Mapleton and parts of several surrounding townships. Dunlap, Hanna City and the Timber Logan Water District are sale for resale (wholesale) customers.\nAbout Illinois American Water - Illinois American Water, a subsidiary of American Water (NYSE: AWK), is the largest investor-owned water utility in the state, providing high-quality and reliable water and/or wastewater services to approximately 1.3 million people.
