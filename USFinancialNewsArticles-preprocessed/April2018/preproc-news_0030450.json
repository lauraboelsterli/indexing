    "text": "(Adds details on actions by other banks on gunmakers and retailers)\nNEW YORK, April 13 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co, the No. 3 U.S. lender by assets, has no plans to stop doing business with gunmakers in light of steps outlined by rival banks, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said on Friday.\nThe San Francisco-based lender wants Congress to create a legislative solution for dealing with gunmakers and is \"not currently setting policy in our extension of credit,\" he said during a call with reporters.\nMajor financial firms have been under pressure from gun-control activists to limit their support for firearms makers and retailers since 17 people died in a school shooting in Florida in February.\nCitigroup Inc, for instance, last month slapped restrictions on new clients in the retail sector who sell guns, such as having the retailers require customers to pass background checks.\nIn addition, Bank of America plans to stop lending to companies that make military-style firearms for civilians, a BofA executive said this week.
