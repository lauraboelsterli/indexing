    "text": "April 2 (Reuters) - Alkermes Plc said on Monday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejected the application seeking approval for its experimental depression drug, citing insufficient evidence of effectiveness.\nThe company said it strongly disagreed with the FDA and planned to appeal the regulator’s decision after the regulator sent a “Refusal to File” letter to the company.\nThe drug, ALKS 5461, is being tested as adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder in patients with an inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapies.
