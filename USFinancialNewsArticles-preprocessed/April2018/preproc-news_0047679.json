(the \"Company\") (NYSE:TPH) today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nResults and Operational Data for First Quarter 2018 and Comparisons to First Quarter 2017\nNet income available to common stockholders was $42.9 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to $8.2 million, or $0.05 per diluted share New home orders of 1,496 compared to 1,299, an increase of 15% Active selling communities averaged 129.8 compared to 125.5, an increase of 3%\n— New home orders per average selling community were 11.5 orders (3.8 monthly) compared to 10.4 orders (3.5 monthly)\n— Cancellation rate remained flat at 14% Backlog units at quarter end of 2,143 homes compared to 1,734, an increase of 24%\n— Dollar value of backlog at quarter end of $1.4 billion compared to $1.0 billion, an increase of 39%\n— Average sales price in backlog at quarter end of $658,000 compared to $585,000, an increase of 12% Home sales revenue of $582.6 million compared to $392.0 million, an increase of 49%\n— New home deliveries of 924 homes compared to 758 homes, an increase of 22%\n— Average sales price of homes delivered of $630,000 compared to $517,000, an increase of 22% Homebuilding gross margin percentage of 22.7% compared to 18.8%, an increase of 390 basis points\n— Excluding interest and impairments and lot option abandonments, adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage was 25.2%* SG&A expense as a percentage of homes sales revenue of 12.9% compared to 15.7%, a decrease of 280 basis points Ratios of debt-to-capital and net debt-to-net capital of 42.9% and 36.9%*, respectively, as of March 31, 2018 Ended first quarter of 2018 with total liquidity of $917.2 million, including cash of $324.6 million and $592.6 million of availability under the Company's unsecured revolving credit facility\n* See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\"\n“2018 is off to a great start,” said TRI Pointe Group Chief Executive Officer Doug Bauer. “Earnings per share for the first quarter of 2018 grew more than five-fold on a year-over-year basis, thanks to significant increases in unit deliveries, average sales prices, and homebuilding gross margins. We saw strong demand throughout the quarter, as evidenced by our absorption rate of 3.8 homes per community per month. This demand was broad based, both from a geographic and segmentation standpoint, which enabled us to raise prices in several of our communities and helped offset cost pressures that the homebuilding industry has been facing. Our legacy assets in California continued to deliver strong results for our company, and I am pleased to report that all of our brands posted year-over-year homebuilding gross margin improvement. With excellent momentum on a number of fronts and a 39% increase to quarter-ending backlog on a dollar value basis, TRI Pointe Group is well positioned to achieve its goals in 2018.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Operating Results\nNet income available to common stockholders was $42.9 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to net income available to common stockholders of $8.2 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nHome sales revenue increased $190.6 million, or 49%, to $582.6 million for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $392.0 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to a 22% increase in new home deliveries to 924, and a 22% increase in the average sales price of homes delivered to $630,000, compared to $517,000 in the first quarter of 2017.\nNew home orders increased 15% to 1,496 homes for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to 1,299 homes for the same period in 2017. Average selling communities increased 3% to 129.8 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 125.5 for the first quarter of 2017. The Company’s overall absorption rate per average selling community increased 11% for the first quarter of 2018 to 11.5 orders (3.8 monthly) compared to 10.4 orders (3.5 monthly) during the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Company ended the quarter with 2,143 homes in backlog, representing approximately $1.4 billion. The average sales price of homes in backlog as of March 31, 2018 increased $73,000, or 12%, to $658,000, compared to $585,000 as of March 31, 2017.\nHomebuilding gross margin percentage for the first quarter of 2018 increased to 22.7%, compared to 18.8% for the first quarter of 2017. Excluding interest and impairments and lot option abandonments in cost of home sales, adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage was 25.2%* for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 21.3%* for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in homebuilding gross margin percentage was largely due to the mix of homes delivered, primarily in California.\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expense for the first quarter of 2018 decreased to 12.9% of home sales revenue as compared to 15.7% for the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to increased leverage as a result of a 49% increase in home sales revenue.\n“Our performance this quarter is a testament to the quality of our local leadership teams and the emphasis TRI Pointe Group has put on design and innovation,” said TRI Pointe Group Chief Operating Officer Tom Mitchell. “Housing fundamentals remain strong in the markets in which we build, and we’ve been able to capitalize on this strength by making sure we have the right product in the right location. We have empowered our local teams to run their operations in an entrepreneurial manner, and they in turn have embraced TRI Pointe’s unique approach to homebuilding. This dynamic has been our formula for success for several years now, and we believe it will continue into the future.”\n* See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”\nOutlook\nFor the second quarter of 2018, the Company expects to open 16 new communities, and close out of 19, resulting in 128 active selling communities as of June 30, 2018. In addition, the Company anticipates delivering 50% to 55% of its 2,143 units in backlog as of March 31, 2018 at an average sales price in a range of $620,000 to $630,000. The Company anticipates its homebuilding gross margin percentage will be in a range of 21.0% to 21.5% for the second quarter. Finally, the Company expects its SG&A expense as a percentage of home sales revenue to be in the range of 11.5% to 12.0% for the second quarter.\nFor the full year 2018, the Company is reiterating its original guidance of growing average selling communities by 5% compared to 2017 and delivering between 5,100 and 5,400 homes at an average sales price of approximately $610,000. The Company is updating its homebuilding gross margin percentage for the full year 2018 to be in the range of 21.0% to 21.5%, raising the low end of its previously stated range of 20.5% to 21.5%. The Company is reiterating its original guidance of SG&A expense as a percentage of home sales revenue to be in the range of 9.9% to 10.3% and its effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 26%.\nEarnings Conference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call via live webcast for investors and other interested parties beginning at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 25, 2018.

and Exchange Commission. We present these measures because we believe they and similar measures are useful to management and investors in evaluating the Company’s operating performance and financing structure. We also believe these measures facilitate the comparison of our operating performance and financing structure with other companies in our industry. Because these measures are not calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table reconciles homebuilding gross margin percentage, as reported and prepared in accordance with GAAP, to the non-GAAP measure adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage. We believe this information is meaningful as it isolates the impact that leverage has on homebuilding gross margin and permits investors to make better comparisons with our competitors, who adjust gross margins in a similar fashion.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 % 2017 % (dollars in thousands) Home sales revenue $ 582,572 100.0 % $ 392,004 100.0 % Cost of home sales 450,502 77.3 % 318,404 81.2 % Homebuilding gross margin 132,070 22.7 % 73,600 18.8 % Add: interest in cost of home sales 14,229 2.4 % 9,680 2.5 % Add: impairments and lot option abandonments 248 0.0 % 288 0.1 % Adjusted homebuilding gross margin $ 146,547 25.2 % $ 83,568 21.3 % Homebuilding gross margin percentage 22.7 % 18.8 % Adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage 25.2 % 21.3 % RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (continued)\n(unaudited)\nThe following table reconciles the Company’s ratio of debt-to-capital to the non-GAAP ratio of net debt-to-net capital. We believe that the ratio of net debt-to-net capital is a relevant financial measure for management and investors to understand the leverage employed in our operations and as an indicator of the Company’s ability to obtain financing.\nMarch 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Senior notes $ 1,473,074 $ 1,471,302 Total debt 1,473,074 1,471,302 Stockholders’ equity 1,963,644 1,929,722 Total capital $ 3,436,718 $ 3,401,024 Ratio of debt-to-capital (1) 42.9 % 43.3 % Total debt $ 1,473,074 $ 1,471,302 Less: Cash and cash equivalents (324,608 ) (282,914 ) Net debt 1,148,466 1,188,388 Stockholders’ equity 1,963,644 1,929,722 Net capital $ 3,112,110 $ 3,118,110 Ratio of net debt-to-net capital (2) 36.9 % 38.1 % (1) The ratio of debt-to-capital is computed as the quotient obtained by dividing debt by the sum of debt plus equity.\n(2) The ratio of net debt-to-net capital is computed as the quotient obtained by dividing net debt (which is debt less cash and cash equivalents) by the sum of net debt plus equity.\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (continued)\n(unaudited)\nThe following table calculates the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and reconciles those amounts to net income, as reported and prepared in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA means net income before (a) interest expense, (b) expensing of previously capitalized interest included in costs of home sales, (c) income taxes and (d) depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA means EBITDA before (e) amortization of stock-based compensation, (f) impairments and lot option abandonments and (h) restructuring charges. Other companies may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (or similarly titled measures) differently. We believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful measures of the Company’s ability to service debt and obtain financing.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (in thousands) Net income available to common stockholders $ 42,880 $ 8,193 Interest expense: Interest incurred 21,520 18,873 Interest capitalized (21,520 ) (18,873 ) Amortization of interest in cost of sales 14,242 9,687 Provision for income taxes 14,660 4,614 Depreciation and amortization 5,488 822 EBITDA 77,270 23,316 Amortization of stock-based compensation 3,470 3,841 Impairments and lot option abandonments 248 321 Restructuring charges — 203 Adjusted EBITDA $ 80,988 $ 27,681\nSource:TRI Pointe Group Inc.",
