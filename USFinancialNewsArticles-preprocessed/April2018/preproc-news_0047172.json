Up 3-0, down 3-0 you know what the Spurs are going to do.”\nAldridge’s critical 3-pointer came after the Warriors had rallied within 88-86 on a Durant 3-pointer with 5:57 to play.\nAfter Ginobili hit a pair of free throws to increase the San Antonio lead to four, Aldridge was able to connect on his unconventional 25-footer from straight away despite tight defense from Green for a 93-86 advantage.\nThe Warriors, who had swept the Spurs in the Western Conference finals last season, were never closer than five the rest of the way.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
