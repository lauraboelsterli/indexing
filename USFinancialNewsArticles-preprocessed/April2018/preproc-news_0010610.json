    "text": "April 5, 2018 / 11:08 PM / Updated 11 minutes ago Trump proposes $100 billion more in tariffs on China, cites IP Reuters Staff 1   U.S. President Donald Trump said in a statement on Thursday that he has instructed U.S. trade officials to consider $100 billion (71.4 billion pounds) in additional tariffs on China “in light of China’s unfair retaliation” against earlier U.S. tariff actions. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks about tax reform during a visit to White Sulphur Springs, in West Virginia, U.S., April 5, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque \nThe statement said the U.S. Trade Representative has determined that China “has repeatedly engaged in practices to unfairly obtain America’s intellectual property.” Reporting by Eric Beech; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and James Dalgleish",
