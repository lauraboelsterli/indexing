    "text": "BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - A Libyan transport plane crashed on Sunday at an airfield at El Sharara oilfield, killing three people, an oil engineer said.\nThe two pilots and a flight assistant were killed in the crash, said the engineer who works at the field.\nAuthorities use aircraft to deliver supplies to the remote oilfield.\nThe plane crashed and exploded in the desert away from the oilfield’s facilities.\nSharara is seen as crucial to helping Libya’s economic recovery but output has been repeatedly disrupted due to blockades by armed groups, protests and other security problems.\nReporting by Ayman al-Warfalli and Ahmed Elumami; writing by Ulf Laessing; editing by Jason Neely\n ",
