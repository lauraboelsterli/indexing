    "text": "GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., April 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Independent Bank Corporation (NASDAQ:IBCP) reported first quarter 2018 net income of $9.2 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, versus net income of $6.0 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. The first quarter of 2018, included a $1.5 million fair value increase due to price for capitalized mortgage loan servicing rights, $0.2 million in net securities losses and $0.2 million of merger related expenses. Collectively, these items increased net income by $0.9 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. Additionally, the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% (that was effective Jan. 1, 2018) increased net income by approximately $0.07 per diluted share compared to the year ago period.\nFirst quarter 2018 highlights include:\nNet income and diluted earnings per share increases of 53.3% and 50.0%, respectively, over 2017; Year-over-year and sequential quarterly increases in net interest income of $2.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively; Net growth in total portfolio loans of $52.6 million, or 10.6% annualized; A $1.6 million, or 15.8%, decline in non-performing assets.\nWilliam B. (“Brad”) Kessel, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Independent Bank Corporation, commented: “We are pleased to report a solid start to 2018. Strong loan growth, continued reductions in non-performing assets and a lower federal corporate income tax rate helped lead to a 53% increase in our net income. Return on average assets and return on average equity reached 1.34% and 14.04%, respectively. Net interest income and our net interest margin increased on both a sequential and year-over-year quarterly basis. As previously announced, our acquisition of Traverse City State Bank (“TCSB”) was completed on April 1, 2018. We are excited about this addition, and as we look ahead to the remainder of 2018, we are focused on the successful integration of TCSB, capitalizing on growth opportunities across our markets, stable to improving asset quality, and building core deposits.”\nOperating Results\nThe Company’s net interest income totaled $23.9 million during the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $2.5 million, or 11.5%, from the year-ago period, and an increase of $0.6 million, or 2.7% from the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company’s tax equivalent net interest income as a percent of average interest-earning assets (the “net interest margin”) was 3.71% during the first quarter of 2018 compared to 3.69% in the year ago period, and 3.65% in the fourth quarter of 2017. The year-over-year quarterly increase in net interest income is due to increases in both the net interest margin and in average interest-earning assets. Total average interest-earning assets were $2.61 billion in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $2.37 billion in the year ago quarter and $2.57 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. Net interest income included net recoveries of interest on non-accrual or previously charged-off loans of $0.18 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.50 million in the year ago quarter and $0.19 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNon-interest income totaled $11.5 million and $10.3 million in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively. This increase is primarily due to an increase in mortgage loan servicing income. The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” (“ASU 2014-09”) on Jan. 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective approach. Although ASU 2014-09 did not have any impact on Jan. 1, 2018 shareholders’ equity or first quarter 2018 net income, it did result in some classification changes in non-interest income and non-interest expense as compared to the prior year period. Specifically, in the first quarter of 2018, interchange income and interchange expense each increased by $0.3 million and investment and insurance commissions (included in other non-interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations) and compensation and employee benefits expense each decreased by $0.2 million, due to classification changes under ASU 2014-09.\nGains on mortgage loans were unchanged at $2.6 million in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, as an increase in mortgage loan sales volume was offset by compression in the profit margin. Mortgage loan origination volume was up 0.6% to $159.0 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the year ago period.\nMortgage loan servicing generated income of $2.2 million and $0.8 million in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively. This activity is summarized in the following table:\nThree Months Ended 03/31/2018 03/31/2017 Mortgage loan servicing: (Dollars in thousands) Revenue, net $ 1,192 $ 1,089 Fair value change due to price 1,458 145 Fair value change due to pay-downs (429 ) (409 ) Total $ 2,221 $ 825 The significant variance in the fair value change due to price relates primarily to the rise in mortgage loan interest rates in the first quarter of 2018. That increase reduced projected prepayment rates for mortgage loans serviced for others, leading to an increase in fair value.\nNon-interest expense totaled $23.9 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $23.6 million in the year-ago period, representing an increase of 1.6%.\nThe Company recorded an income tax expense of $2.0 million and $2.6 million in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively. Income tax expense represented 18.2% and 30.5% of pre-tax earnings in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decline in income tax expense is primarily due to a reduction in the statutory federal corporate income tax rate to 21% (from 35%) that became effective on Jan. 1, 2018.\nAsset Quality\nCommenting on asset quality, President and CEO Kessel added: “We continue to make progress in further improving asset quality, as evidenced by a decline in non-performing assets. In addition, thirty- to eighty-nine day delinquency rates at Mar. 31, 2018 were 0.005% for commercial loans and 0.39% for mortgage and consumer loans. These early stage delinquency rates continue to be well-managed.”\nA breakdown of non-performing loans (1) by loan type is as follows:\nLoan Type 3/31/2018 12/31/2017 3/31/2017 (Dollars in Thousands) Commercial $ 439 $ 646 $ 1,325 Consumer/installment 605 543 829 Mortgage 5,585 6,995 6,860 Total $ 6,629 $ 8,184 $ 9,014 Ratio of non-performing loans to total portfolio loans 0.32% 0.41% 0.54% Ratio of non-performing assets to total assets 0.30% 0.35% 0.55% Ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans 348.03% 275.99% 222.30% (1) Excludes loans that are classified as “troubled debt restructured” that are still performing.\nNon-performing loans decreased by $1.6 million, or 19.0%, since year-end 2017. The decline in non-performing loans primarily reflects loan charge-offs, pay-offs, negotiated transactions and the migration of loans into other real estate (“ORE”). ORE and repossessed assets totaled $1.6 million at both Mar. 31, 2018 and at Dec. 31, 2017.\nThe provision for loan losses was an expense of $0.3 million and a credit of $0.4 million in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The level of the provision for loan losses in each period reflects the Company’s overall assessment of the allowance for loan losses, taking into consideration factors such as loan mix, levels of non-performing and classified loans and loan net charge-offs. The Company recorded loan net recoveries of $0.2 million [(0.03)% annualized of average loans] in the first quarter of 2018, compared to loan net recoveries of $0.2 million [(0.04)% annualized of average loans] in the first quarter of 2017. At Mar. 31, 2018, the allowance for loan losses totaled $23.1 million, or 1.11% of portfolio loans, compared to $22.6 million, or 1.12% of portfolio loans, at Dec. 31, 2017.\nBalance Sheet, Liquidity and Capital\nTotal assets were $2.79 billion at Mar. 31, 2018, an increase of $3.8 million from Dec. 31, 2017. Loans, excluding loans held for sale, were $2.07 billion at Mar. 31, 2018, compared to $2.02 billion at Dec. 31, 2017. Deposits totaled $2.43 billion at Mar. 31, 2018, an increase of $29.9 million from Dec. 31, 2017. The increase in deposits is primarily due to growth in savings and interest-bearing checking account balances.\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $42.4 million at Mar. 31, 2018, versus $54.7 million at Dec. 31, 2017. Securities available for sale totaled $489.1 million at Mar. 31, 2018, versus $522.9 million at Dec. 31, 2017.\nTotal shareholders’ equity was $267.9 million at Mar. 31, 2018, or 9.59% of total assets. Tangible common equity totaled $266.4 million at Mar. 31, 2018, or $12.46 per share. The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Independent Bank, remains significantly above “well capitalized” for regulatory purposes with the following ratios:\nRegulatory Capital Ratios 3/31/2018 12/31/2017 Well\nCapitalized\nMinimum Tier 1 capital to average total assets 10.01% 9.78% 5.00% Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets 13.25% 12.95% 6.50% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 13.25% 12.95% 8.00% Total capital to risk-weighted assets 14.40% 14.10% 10.00% Share Repurchase Plan\nAs previously announced, on Jan. 22, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a share repurchase plan. Under the terms of the share repurchase plan, the Company is authorized to buy back up to 5% of its outstanding common stock. The repurchase plan is authorized to last through Dec. 31, 2018. Thus far in 2018, the Company has not repurchased any shares.\nEarnings Conference Call\nBrad Kessel, President and CEO, and Rob Shuster, CFO, will review the quarterly results in a conference call for investors and analysts beginning at 11:00 am ET on Monday, Apr. 23, 2018.\nTo participate in the live conference call, please dial 1-866-200-8394.
