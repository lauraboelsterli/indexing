    "text": "MCLEAN, Va., April 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Freddie Mac (OTCQB:FMCC) today announced that Ricardo Anzaldua will join the company as Executive Vice President and Senior Legal Advisor to CEO Donald H. Layton in May 2018. After a transition period, Mr. Anzaldua is expected to succeed William H. McDavid, Executive Vice President – General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. McDavid recently informed the company that he will be retiring from Freddie Mac at the end of 2018.\n“For six years, Bill McDavid has driven the legal and regulatory strategy that helped transform Freddie Mac into a fundamentally better company. His counsel will be sorely missed,” said Freddie Mac CEO Donald H. Layton. “At the same time, we welcome to Freddie Mac Ricardo Anzaldua, an accomplished attorney and experienced general counsel whose experience and advice will be invaluable as we prepare for the future.”\nMr. Anzaldua was Executive Vice President and General Counsel of MetLife, Inc., from 2012 until 2017. From 2007 to 2012, he held senior positions in the legal department of the Hartford Financial Services Group. He began his legal career at the law firm of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton LLP, where he became a partner in 1999. Mr. Anzaldua received a B.A. degree from Brown University in 1979 and a J.D. degree from the Harvard Law School in 1990.\nFreddie Mac makes home possible for millions of families and individuals by providing mortgage capital to lenders. Since our creation by Congress in 1970, we’ve made housing more accessible and affordable for homebuyers and renters in communities nationwide. We are building a better housing finance system for homebuyers, renters, lenders and taxpayers.
