(Nasdaq:PRTK), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies based upon tetracycline chemistry, today announced the appointment on April 11, 2018 of Rolf K. Hoffman, a global biopharmaceutical industry executive with more than three decades of experience, to the Company’s board of directors. At the same time, long-time director Richard Lim stepped down from the board effective April 11, 2018.\n“On behalf of the Board of Directors and management, we are delighted to welcome Rolf to Paratek. His broad pharmaceutical experience over the past three decades, including with antibiotics, significantly complements our existing board and adds proven U.S. and international commercial experience as we prepare for the launch of omadacycline. With our NDA submissions recently accepted for review by the FDA for this important new antibiotic, Rolf’s insights will be invaluable as we move into this exciting next phase for the company,” said Michael Bigham, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Paratek.\nBigham continued, “With Rolf’s appointment, we express our sincere appreciation and gratitude to Rich Lim, whose enthusiasm and steadfast support for the Company has been critical to our emergence as a public company and the successful development of our lead product candidate, omadacycline. Rich was instrumental in helping to guide the Company to the prospective approval of omadacycline and our ongoing preparations for potential commercial launch. We are truly grateful for his many contributions.”\nMr. Hoffman brings significant experience in pharmaceutical commercial strategy and operations to the Paratek board, having served in several senior commercial management roles over the course of his career. Most recently, Mr. Hoffman spent 12 years at Amgen, including as Senior Vice President, International Commercial Operations and Senior Vice President, U.S. Commercial Operations.

In addition, Mr. Hoffman is an adjunct professor for Strategy and Entrepreneurship at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where he earned his Master’s in Business Administration.\n“There is not a more exciting time to be at a pharmaceutical company than during launch preparations for a lead product,” remarked Mr. Hoffman. “Paratek has built a solid foundation and professionally executed on their development strategy for omadacycline. I am delighted to help guide the Company as they make this important transition to a commercial stage organization.”\nAbout Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nParatek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies based upon its expertise in novel tetracycline chemistry. The Company’s lead product candidate, omadacycline, is an investigational new, once-daily oral and intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotic being developed for the treatment of serious community-acquired bacterial infections, including community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP), acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI), and urinary tract infections (UTI). Omadacycline has been granted Qualified Infectious Disease Product designation and Fast Track status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the target indications of ABSSSI, CABP, uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTI) and complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI).

Paratek has entered into a collaboration agreement with Zai Lab for the development and commercialization of omadacycline in the greater China region and retains all remaining global rights.\nUnder a research agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense, omadacycline also is being studied against pathogenic agents causing infectious diseases of public health and biodefense importance, including plague and anthrax.\nParatek's second Phase 3 product candidate, SEYSARA™ (sarecycline), is being developed by Allergan in the U.S. as a new once-daily oral therapy for the treatment of acne. Allergan has completed Phase 3 development activities for Seysara and its new drug application was accepted for review by the U.S. FDA in December 2017.
