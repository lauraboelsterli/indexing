    "text": "(Reuters) - Shares of American optical components makers fell on Monday after the U.S. Department of Commerce decided to ban companies from selling components to Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp for seven years.\nVisitors pass in front of the Chinese telecoms equipment group ZTE Corp booth at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, February 26, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman ZTE pleaded guilty last year in federal court in Texas for conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions by illegally shipping U.S. goods and technology to Iran.\nShares of Maynard, Massachusetts-based Acacia Communications Inc, an exclusive supplier to ZTE which got 30 percent of its total revenue in 2017 from the company, fell as much as 34.7 percent in early trade, hitting a record low.\nShares of another supplier, Oclaro Inc, which earned 18 percent of its fiscal 2017 revenue from ZTE, fell 17 percent.\nStocks of other optical companies were also trading lower. Lumentum Holdings Inc fell 6.8 percent, Finisar Corp 3.7 percent, Inphi Corp 11.3 percent, Fabrinet 10.4 percent, and NeoPhotonics and Applied Optoelectronics 4.7 percent each.\nLumentum declined to comment, while others optical component makers were not immediately available for comment.\nReporting by Sonam Rai and Arjun Panchadar in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber and Arun Koyyur\n ",
