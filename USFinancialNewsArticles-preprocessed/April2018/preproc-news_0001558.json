    "text": "STAMFORD, Conn., April 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Providence Service Corporation (the “Company” or “Providence”) (Nasdaq:PRSC) today announced that its Board of Directors has amended its ongoing stock repurchase program to add an additional $78 million of capacity and extend the expiration date of the program from December 31, 2018 to June 30, 2019. As of April 3, 2018, and inclusive of this $78 million increase, the Company has approximately $100 million of share repurchase availability under its share repurchase program.\n“The decision by Providence’s Board to increase the capacity of our share repurchase program demonstrates our confidence in the continued strength and long-term growth prospects of our core business, LogistiCare,” said Providence’s interim CEO, Carter Pate. “Further building upon the success of our previous repurchase efforts, this increase also underscores our ongoing focus on our capital allocation strategy. Providence’s financial position, including a strong balance sheet and solid cash generation, permits us to opportunistically return capital to our shareholders through buybacks while also committing capital towards our numerous value enhancement initiatives focused on driving revenue growth and margin expansion at LogistiCare.”\nPurchases under the Company’s stock repurchase program may be made from time-to-time through a combination of open market repurchases (including Rule 10b5-1 plans), privately negotiated transactions, and accelerated share repurchase transactions, at the discretion of the Company’s officers, and as permitted by securities laws, covenants under existing bank agreements, and other legal requirements. The stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The timing, number and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by Company management at its discretion and will be based on a number of factors, including its evaluation of general market and economic conditions and the trading price of the common stock.\nAbout Providence\nThe Providence Service Corporation owns subsidiaries and investments primarily engaged in the provision of healthcare services in the United States and workforce development services internationally.
