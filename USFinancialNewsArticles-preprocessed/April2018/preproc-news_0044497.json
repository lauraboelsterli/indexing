    "text": "PANAMA CITY, April 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Banco Latinoamericano de Comercio Exterior, S.A. (NYSE: BLX, \"Bladex\", or \"the Bank\"), a Panama-based multinational bank originally established by the central banks of 23 Latin-American and Caribbean countries to promote foreign trade and economic integration in the Region, today announced its results for the first quarter (\"1Q18\") ended March 31, 2018.\nThe consolidated financial information in this document has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IASB\").\n(US$ million, except percentages and per share amounts)\n1Q18\n4Q17\n1Q17\nKey Income Statement Highlights\nTotal income\n$30.7\n$34.5\n$38.3\nImpairment loss from ECL on loans, loan commitments and financial guarantees contracts\n$2.0\n$0.9\n$4.1\nOperating expenses (1)\n$14.3\n$13.1\n$11.2\nProfit for the period\n$14.5\n$20.6\n$23.5\nProfitability Ratios\nEarnings per Share (\"EPS\") (2)\n$0.37\n$0.52\n$0.60\nReturn on Average Equity (\"ROAE\") (3)\n5.6%\n7.9%\n9.4%\nReturn on Average Assets (\"ROAA\")\n0.91%\n1.31%\n1.39%\nNet Interest Margin (\"NIM\") (4)\n1.68%\n1.78%\n2.02%\nNet Interest Spread (\"NIS\") (5)\n1.26%\n1.38%\n1.71%\nEfficiency Ratio (6)\n47%\n38%\n29%\nAssets, Capital, Liquidity & Credit Quality\nCommercial Portfolio (7)\n$5,731\n$5,999\n$6,141\nTreasury Portfolio\n$85\n$85\n$91\nTotal assets\n$5,875\n$6,268\n$7,067\nTotal stockholders' equity\n$1,047\n$1,043\n$1,019\nMarket capitalization (8)\n$1,127\n$1,061\n$1,088\nTier 1 Basel III Capital Ratio (9)\n22.6%\n21.1%\n19.0%\nTotal assets / Total stockholders' equity (times)\n5.6\n6.0\n6.9\nLiquid Assets / Total Assets (10)\n9.3%\n9.9%\n17.3%\nNPL to Loan Portfolio (11)\n1.12%\n1.07%\n1.14%\nTotal allowance for ECL to Commercial Portfolio (12)\n1.57%\n1.47%\n1.89%\nTotal allowance for ECL to NPL (times) (12)\n1.5\n1.5\n1.8\n1Q18 Highlights\nProfit for the 1Q18 totaled $14.5 million (-30% QoQ, -38% YoY). This decline was mainly attributable to a $4.8 million annual variable compensation expense incurred in 1Q18. Excluding this variable compensation payment, profit for the 1Q18 would have reached $19.3 million (-8% QoQ, -22% YoY). Profits were impacted by lower lending spreads on short-tenor loan originations, together with the usual seasonal slow first quarter effect. The YoY negative comparisons were partially offset by lower impairment losses for ECL. NII decreased 6% QoQ and 23% YoY on lower NIM (-10 bps QoQ, -34 bps YoY), reflecting mostly lower lending spreads on short-tenor loan originations. Letters of credit and contingencies continued to perform well. Total fee generation was $3.0 million for the 1Q18, +3% QoQ and -1% YoY. Syndications and structuring did not close any new transactions during the 1Q18, reflecting its lumpy nature of fee generation. This compares to a fee generation of $2.7 million in 4Q17. Total operating expenses were up 9% QoQ and 28% YoY, impacted by the $4.8 million annual variable compensation expense incurred in 1Q18. Excluding this variable compensation payment, quarterly base operating expenses were lower, reflecting the Bank's ongoing focus on cost reduction and improving productivity. 1Q18 annualized Return on Average Equity (\"ROAE\") stood at 5.6%, compared to 7.9% in 4Q17 and 9.4% in 1Q17, as a result of lower profits while capitalization remained strong. Tier 1 Basel III Capital Ratio reached 22.6% at the end of 1Q18 (+150 bps QoQ, +360 bps YoY), with risk-weighted assets down 6% QoQ and 14% YoY. Average Commercial Portfolio balances in 1Q18 were higher by 3% QoQ and lower by 2% YoY, while EoP balances decreased 4% QoQ and 7% YoY, as strong loan origination was offset by short average tenor. Credit quality remained sound with $58.8 million of non-performing loans (\"NPL\") at the end of the 1Q18, the same level from the previous quarter and down from $65.4 million a year ago, resulting in similar levels of NPL to Loan Portfolio balances of 1.1%.\nCEO's Comments\nMr. N. Gabriel Tolchinsky, Bladex's Chief Executive Officer, said, \"While our first quarter results were below our expectations, we were encouraged by several positive performance trends during the quarter: average loan balances were higher, contingencies/letters of credit performed well, credit quality remained strong, and we have a robust syndications pipeline. Operating expenses, excluding annual variable compensation expenses, declined from the fourth quarter as a result of our new streamlined operating model which is yielding results and will contribute to higher productivity levels.\n\"On the other hand, our performance this quarter was also affected by tightened net lending spreads pressured by high US dollar liquidity in the Region, the short duration of our trade finance portfolio, and higher exposures to financial institutions.\n\"We are focusing our lending activity on extending the average tenor of our short-term transactions, increasing the medium-term loan origination, and resuming asset growth by expanding the client base as well as maximizing the utilization of existing approved credit limits. We believe this effort will result in higher EOP balances and improved returns in the coming quarters. Combined with our ongoing focus on reducing costs and increasing productivity, we are cautiously optimistic about the second quarter and the full year,\" Mr. Tolchinsky concluded.\nRECENT EVENTS\nAnnual Shareholders' Meeting Results: At the Annual Shareholders' Meeting held on April 11, 2018, in Panama City, Panama, shareholders:\ni.
