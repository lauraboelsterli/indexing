    "text": "CENTRAL ISLIP, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CVD Equipment Corporation (NASDAQ: CVV ), a leading provider of chemical vapor deposition systems and materials, today announced its most successful annual financial results in its 35 year history.\nCVD completed its record breaking 2017 year with over $41.1 million in annual revenue compared to $21.0 million in annual revenue for 2016, an increase of over 96%. 2017 fourth quarter revenue reached $9.8 million, an increase of $2.5 million or 34% compared to the $7.3 million recorded 2016.\nNet income for the year totaled $5.3 million or $0.82 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of ($149,000) or ($0.02) per diluted share in the prior year.\n“2017 was an eventful year for CVD, as it successfully converted much of its record breaking order levels from 2016 into revenue as well as acquiring the assets of MesoScribe Technologies, Inc. and purchasing an additional facility to significantly expand our materials operations. The expanded materials operations this year will enhance our capabilities in providing i) corrosion resistant coatings through our Tantaline subsidiary for medical, pharma, oil and gas applications, ii) sensors through our MesoScribe subsidiary for aerospace and turbine applications, and iii) through our CVD Materials subsidiary for carbon composite materials for medical applications, substrate materials for the electronics industry and further expansion into other coatings for aerospace, medical, and industrial applications,” said Leonard Rosenbaum, President and Chief Executive Officer. “While our 2017 year-end backlog is down from year end 2016, we have made great strides during 2017 in rebuilding our core business and expect that trend to continue in 2018.”\nThe Company will hold a conference call to discuss its results today at 4:30 pm (Eastern Time).
