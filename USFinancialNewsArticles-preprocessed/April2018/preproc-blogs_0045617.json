    "text": "GRAINS-Wheat edges lower, set to finish the week up nearly 4 percent Published 8:41 PM ET Thu, 19 April 2018 Reuters \nSYDNEY, April 20 (Reuters) - U.S. wheat futures edged lower on Friday but were set to post a weekly gain of nearly 4 percent as earlier forecasts of much needed rains were scaled back, heightening concerns about the condition of the U.S. crop. \nFUNDAMENTALS \n* The most active wheat futures on the Chicago Board of Trade were up nearly 4 percent so far for the week, a third consecutive weekly gain. \n* The most active soybean futures were down 0.5 percent for the week after posting a 2 percent gain in the previous week. \n* The most active corn futures were up 1 percent for the week, the biggest weekly gain in three weeks. \n* The U.S. Agriculture Department on Thursday morning said soybean export sales in the week ended April 12 totalled 2.132 million tonnes, near the high end of market forecasts for 1.4 million to 2.2 million tonnes. \n* The USDA has not reported any spot sales this week, highlighting worries about exporters striking fresh deals with the world's largest buyer of the oilseed amid escalations of trade threats between the United States and China. \n* Earlier forecasts of substantial rainfall in the U.S. Plains this weekend had led to sharp losses on Monday. But subsequent projections have pointed to limited rain next week, which could keep crops struggling with drought. \nMARKET NEWS \n* The dollar gained against a basket of currencies on Thursday on higher U.S. bond yields and expectations of more rate increases from the Federal Reserve, while sterling fell to a near two-week low on perceived dovish remarks from the head of the Bank of England. \n* Oil prices on Thursday hit highs not seen since 2014, built on the ongoing drawdowns in global supply and as Saudi Arabia looks to push prices higher, though U.S. crude gave back gains in the afternoon to finish lower. \n* Wall Street's three major indexes closed lower on Thursday, with tobacco stocks leading a tumble in consumer staples while concerns about smartphone demand hurt the technology sector and rising bond yields and earnings helped financials rebound. \nDATA/EVENT AHEAD (GMT) \n0600 Germany Producer prices Mar 1400 Euro zone Consumer confidence flash Apr 1645 Washington G20 Finance Ministers hold news conference \nfollowing their talks on the sidelines of the spring meeting of the IMF and World Bank \nGrains prices at 0014 GMT \nContract Last Change Pct chg Two-day chg MA 30 RSI CBOT wheat 490.00 -0.75 -0.15% +3.10% 468.84 53 CBOT corn 381.50 -0.50 -0.13% -0.39% 383.48 39 CBOT soy 1048.25 -0.75 -0.07% +0.62% 1037.55 45 CBOT rice 13.03 -$0.05 -0.38% -1.10% $12.57 63 WTI crude 68.29 $0.00 +0.00% -0.26% $64.43 72 \nCurrencies \nEuro/dlr $1.234 $0.000 -0.02% -0.25% USD/AUD 0.7715 -0.001 -0.17% -0.86% \nMost active contracts Wheat, corn and soy US cents/bushel.
