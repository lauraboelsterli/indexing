    "text": "FRANKLIN, Ind.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- OTCPINK “TDCB” - Third Century Bancorp (“Company”), the holding company for Mutual Savings Bank (“Bank”) announced it had net income of $216,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, or $0.18 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $167,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, or $0.15 per basic and diluted share. The improvement in net income was primarily driven by an increase of $143,000 in interest income, which was partially offset by a $70,000 increase in interest expense. The Company also recorded a $76,000 increase in noninterest income, as well as an $80,000 increase in noninterest expense. The Company also recorded a $13,000 decrease in income tax expense as a result of the decrease in the corporate tax rate which took effect on January 1, 2018.\nNet interest income was $1,246,000 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $1,174,000 for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase of $143,000, or 11.04%, in interest income, primarily driven by an increase in interest income on loans of $169,000. This increase was offset by an increase in interest expense, which was $191,000 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $121,000 for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in interest expense was driven by increases in deposit interest expense of $59,000, or 105.36% and wholesale funding interest expense of $11,000, or 16.67%.\nThe increase in net interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was partially offset by a $32,000 increase in the provision for loan losses compared to 2017. The increase in provision for loan losses was primarily driven by increased loan volume. Credit quality factors, including net loan charge-offs also factor into the provision for loan losses. The Company saw a decrease in net loan charge-offs to $15,000 during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to net loan charge-offs of $248,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nNoninterest income increased $76,000 to $287,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017. This increase in noninterest income was driven by increases in loans sales of $23,000, as well as increases in FHLB Stock Dividends and other loan fees.\nNoninterest expense increased by $80,000 to $1,193,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017. The increase in expenses were largely driven by increases of $51,000 and $19,000 in personnel expenses and marketing expenses, respectively.\nTotal assets increased $2.0 million to $152.9 million at March 31, 2018 from $150.9 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of 1.32%. The increase in assets was due to an increase in net loans receivable, an increase of $1.6 million.\nThe increase in total assets was funded by an increase in deposits of $2.5 million to $115.9 million at March 31, 2018 from $113.3 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in total deposits was driven by an increase of $6.4 million, or 30.04%, in money market deposits to $27.7 million at March 31, 2018. This increase was offset by a decrease in term deposits of $4.8 million, or 16.71% to a balance of $24.2 million at March 31, 2018.\nStockholders’ equity increased $128,000 to $16.0 million at March 31, 2018 from $15.9 million at December 31, 2017. Stockholders’ equity increased due to the Company’s net income, offset in part by dividends of $71,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Average equity as a percentage of average assets increased to 10.47% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to 10.52% for the period ended December 31, 2017.\nFounded in 1890, Mutual Savings Bank is a full-service financial institution based in Johnson County, Indiana. In addition to its main office at 80 East Jefferson Street, Franklin, Indiana, the bank operates branches in Franklin at 1124 North Main Street and the Franklin United Methodist Community, as well as in Nineveh and Trafalgar, Indiana.\nSelected Consolidated Financial Data (unaudited) At March 31, At December 31, 2018 2017 Selected Consolidated Financial Condition Data : (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Total Assets $ 152,886 $ 150,988 Loans receivable-net of allowance for loan losses of $1,149 and $1,029\n120,921 119,311 Loans held for sale 0 76 Cash and cash equivalents 9,795 8,319 Interest-earning time deposits in other banks 1,736 1,984 Investment securities 13,782 13,544 Deposits 115,827 113,300 FHLB advances and other borrowings 20,500 21,500 Interest payable and other liabilities 546 303 Stockholders’ equity-net 16,013 15,885 Equity to assets ratio at quarter end 10.47 % 10.52 % Non-performing loans to total loans 0.05 0.89 Allowance for loan losses to total loans outstanding\n0.94 0.91 Allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans 2,051.79 103.37 Number of full service offices 5 5 Tangible book value per share $ 13.57 $ 13.46 Market closing price at end of quarter $ 12.70 $ 12.80 Price-to-tangible book value 93.61 % 95.10 % For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (Dollars In Thousands, Except Share Data) Selected Consolidated Earnings Data : Total interest income $ 1,437 $ 1,295 Total interest expense 191 121 Net interest income 1,246 1,174 Provision for losses on loans 62 30 Net interest income after provision for losses on loans\n1,184 1,144 Noninterest income 287 211 Noninterest expense 1,193 1,113 Income tax expense 62 75 Net income $ 216 $ 167 Earnings per basic and diluted share $ 0.18 $ 0.15 Selected Financial Ratios and Other Data : Interest rate spread during period 3.59 % 3.63 % Net yield on interest-earning assets 4.15 3.67 Noninterest expense, annualized, to average assets 3.12 3.18 Return on average assets (annualized) 0.56 0.49 Return on average equity (annualized) 5.39 4.23 Average equity to assets 10.47 11.34 Average interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities\n109.31 103.61 Net loan chargeoffs to average total loans outstanding\n0.01 0.22 Effective income tax rate 22.30 30.99\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180426005961/en/\nThird Century Bancorp\nDavid A.
