In this newly created position, he will be responsible for developing strategy, partnerships, new products and overseeing mergers and acquisitions.\nUmscheid joins LogistiCare from Providence Service Corporation (PRSC), a public healthcare services and workforce development holding company and parent of LogistiCare. As senior vice president of strategic services at PRSC, Umscheid focused on key strategic projects designed to drive shareholder value. Umscheid worked extensively with LogistiCare and Ingeus on projects related to value enhancement efforts.\n\"Matt is a highly skilled professional. His wealth of expertise in business development, corporate transformations, strategic partnerships and mergers and acquisitions makes him the ideal person for this critical new role in LogistiCare’s evolution,” said CEO Jeff Felton. “Because he is extremely familiar with our company, he will be able to jump right in at the executive level to help us better serve our members’ varied needs with greater efficiency.”\nPrior to joining PRSC, Umscheid served as director of strategy and implementation at Parthenon Capital Partners, a private equity firm focused on healthcare, financial services and software.

Umscheid also worked at L.E.K. Consulting where he led dozens of projects aimed at answering strategic questions, tapping growth potential and evaluating investment opportunities. He has also held board of director roles with healthcare companies delivering services to payers and providers.\n“I’m incredibly excited about this new opportunity and have been impressed with how my colleagues are pursuing the mission of LogistiCare,” said Umscheid. “I’m looking forward to working closely with the executive team to develop an enhanced client, member and user experience.”\nUmscheid received an engineering degree from the University of Notre Dame and a MBA from the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth.\nAbout LogistiCare\nLogistiCare, a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Providence Service Corporation (NASDAQ: PRSC), is the nation's largest manager of non-emergency medical transportation programs for state governments and managed care organizations. Its range of services includes call center management, networking credentialing, vendor payment management and non-emergency medical transport management.
