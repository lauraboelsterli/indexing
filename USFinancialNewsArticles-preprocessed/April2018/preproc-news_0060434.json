    "text": "BUENOS AIRES, April 25 (Reuters) - Argentinaâ€™s central bank sold $1.472 billion on the local spot market on Wednesday, its largest intervention in currency markets in at least 15 years after the peso weakened against the dollar in recent sessions.\nThe bank has frequently intervened to prop up the peso in recent months as a weaker currency could spur inflation in a country that has long lived with double-digit increases in consumer prices. It has sold more than $4 billion since March.\nThe peso closed unchanged at 20.255 per dollar on Wednesday.
