It also benefited from net in-flows of around 40 billion euros in the first quarter.\nAmundi bought Pioneer Investments from Italian bank UniCredit for 3.5 billion euros in 2017, and it said the integration of Pioneer was going well and ahead of schedule.\n“Amundi’s very good performance in the first quarter of 2018, driven by all business lines and investment expertise, confirms the value of its business model, further strengthened by the acquisition of Pioneer, whose integration is on track with objectives but in advance with the announced timeline,” said Amundi chief executive Yves Perrier. $1 = 0.8254 euros Reporting by Matthieu Protard; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta",
