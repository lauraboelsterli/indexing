These forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of words or phrases such as \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"future,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"foresee,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"will,\" \"estimates,\" \"outlook,\" \"potential,\" \"optimistic,\" \"confidence,\" \"continue,\" \"evolve,\" \"expand,\" \"growth\" or words and phrases of similar meaning. Statements that describe objectives, plans or goals also are forward-looking statements.\nAll of these forward-looking statements are subject to risks, management assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the relevant forward-looking statements. The principal risk factors that could cause actual performance and future actions to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the company's reliance on a few key vendors for a majority of its merchandise purchases (including a significant portion from one key vendor); the availability and timely receipt of products; the ability to timely fulfill and ship products to customers; fluctuations in oil prices causing changes in gasoline and energy prices, resulting in changes in consumer spending as well as increases in utility, freight and product costs; product demand and market acceptance risks; deterioration of macroeconomic and business conditions; the inability to locate and obtain or retain acceptable lease terms for the company's stores; the effect of competitive products and pricing with other local, regional, and national retailers, as well as many of its own suppliers; loss of key employees; execution of strategic growth initiatives (including actual and potential mergers and acquisitions and other components of the company's capital allocation strategy); cybersecurity risks, including breach of customer data; the potential impact of legal or regulatory changes, including the potential impact of enacted tax reform legislation; a major failure of technology and information systems; and the other risks detailed in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings.
