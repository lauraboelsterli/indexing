    "text": "1 COMMENTS If Spotify’s unusual “direct listing” process was designed to avoid hype, in keeping with co-founder Daniel Ek’s low-key image, it failed spectacularly. In the more conventional aim of giving existing investors and employees an attractive exit, however, it has—at first blush—proven a solid success.\nHaving opened at $165.90 after an apparent rush of buy orders, Spotify shares fell steadily to reach $149.01 at the close . But that is still a good 10th higher than the highest price at which they changed hands in private trading through Feb. 22, the latest date recorded in the company’s prospectus. The public-market price that emerged Tuesday gives Spotify a market value of $26.5 billion; previous estimates clustered round the $20 billion mark.\nThe valuation almost puts Spotify on a par with video-streaming giant Netflix , whose disruption of the U.S. cable-TV market has made it a Silicon Valley darling. Adjusting for debt, Spotify trades for about 24 times gross profits, compared with 31 times for Netflix. Spotify’s Chief Financial Officer Barry McCarthy compared the company to Netflix in last month’s investor day, even though it arguably operates in a much more difficult market. Internet radio veteran Pandora Media , which now competes with Spotify for subscribers to music-on-demand, trades for just three times gross profit.\nThe most plausible explanation for Spotify’s high valuation is that investors think it can use its 157 million active users to disrupt the music industry much more profoundly than it already has. Some see the company as the future of the record industry, others as the future of radio. The problem with these visions is that they bear only a tenuous relation to the present reality. For now, Spotify remains essentially a retailer, with troubling economics to match.\nThe company has a total of 178 million shares, and trading volume was roughly 30 million shares, implying that a relatively small number of the company’s shares were sold. How much more of the share capital will turn over in the coming days is unclear, but it could be substantial. Only 9% of Spotify shares are formally tied up, far less than in most IPOs. The two founders, who together own roughly 39% of the company, have suggested that they are not yet sellers, but this could always change in light of the higher-than-expected share price. For a listing process trumpeted for its transparency, the outlook for share trading is unusually opaque.\nStill, the high share price Spotify has achieved in its public-market debut, even with a bare minimum of contact with potential investors, assures it a place in the history books. The founders of other big-brand tech companies like Airbnb and Pinterest could be sorely tempted to follow the same path. IPO bankers may need to rethink their own business model.\nRelated\nSpotify’s Splashy Debut Pressures Banks All S&P 500 Sectors Post Gains Abu Dhabi Firm Buys Stake in 500 Startups Recap of Spotify’s First Day of Trading Spotify Playlist: The Firm Through Songs Write to Stephen Wilmot at stephen.wilmot@wsj.com",
