    "text": "0 COMMENTS Good morning. As all you marketers and agency folk know: You can’t monkey around with copyright law. You might recall the long-running copyright battle between a wildlife photographer and an Indonesian monkey named Naruto, which had snapped a series of smiley selfies using his unattended camera. Animal-rights organization PETA argued Naruto was the copyright owner of the photos and attempted to sue the photographer. That argument appears to have been consigned to the cutting room floor after a federal appellate court denied PETA’s request to bring copyright claims on behalf of the monkey Monday, ruling animals have no legal ability to hold copyright claims . I’m glad that’s all cleared up.\n‘Tis But a Scratch The data-driven, highly-targeted online advertising model has been thrust under the microscope after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, but that scrutiny is barely a scratch on the industry’s biggest player. Google parent Alphabet reported a surge in profit in its first quarter (its strongest earnings growth since the fourth quarter of 2009,) WSJ reports. Advertising revenue, which made up 86% of the core Google business, grew 24% year-over-year to $26.6 billion--the fastest rate of growth the unit has recorded since 2011, when it was less than half the size. This was the first quarter Google reported an impressions metric, rather than click data for its Network business that provides ad tech for thousands of third-party apps and websites. Alphabet said cost-per-impression on Network properties grew 18% year-over-year, and the number of impressions was flat in the same period. Another interesting data point for marketers to pay attention to: Google is paying out a gob of money to publishers and partners like Apple. Traffic acquisition costs grew a rather large 35% to $6.3 billion\nThey Might Be Giants As has become customary in the past couple of quarters, there were questions from analysts on the Alphabet earnings call about Europe’s forthcoming General Data Protection Regulation. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company is ready and pointed out the majority of its ads business is search-based,relying more on context and keywords than personal information. Google’s readiness underlines one of the unintended consequences of the GDPR: a reinforcement of the duopoly. As WSJ’s Sam Schechner and Nick Kostov report in this must-read piece covering the most important angles of the sweeping privacy laws , Google and Facebook are leveraging their scale and access to legion of lawyers and technicians to ensure they’re compliant to the strictest interpretation of the GDPR. Ad-tech firms say that such a strict interpretation restricts their business as it pressures publishers to seek consent on behalf of dozens of suppliers people haven’t heard of. Some of those ad-tech companies say advertisers may now shift their spending to where there’s clear consumer consent: Hello, Google and Facebook!\nMCEnd? Over to YouTube, a business unit that Alphabet doesn’t split out in its earnings, despite pleas from analysts and investors to do so. Separately on Monday, YouTube published a blog post, saying it had removed more than 8 million bad videos from the platform in the first quarter and that 6.7 million of those were flagged first by its AI. The big YouTube cleanup is reassuring to advertisers, fearing a brand-safety gotcha moment, but it’s becoming a headache for multi-channel networks , Polygon reports. MCNs, as they’re known, work with hundreds or thousands of YouTube creators and package them up for advertisers. But as of late, they’ve been subject to a new “Know Your Customer” policy, requiring them to remove channels that are at risk of violating YouTube’s terms of service. Social Blade CEO Jason Urgo explains in the piece, “Networks now have to either drop [everyone] but their top partners or bring more people on to manually review all content, which just isn’t economical in most cases.”\nMoving Target One of Cambridge Analytica’s biggest claims to marketers and political campaigns was that it could master “psychographic” microtargeting. It turns out at one stage, Facebook showed some interest in the technique too, the BBC reports. Facebook filed a patent in 2012 detailing how personality traits could be used to better target ads . Linguistic information from users’ status updates, messages and comments could be scored for traits like conscientiousness or extroversion in order to select ads or news stories, the BBC says. Facebook said in a statement it has never used the patent in any of its products. Intriguingly, the BBC also saw an email sent between a former Facebook researcher and academics at the Cambridge Psychometrics Center, ( yes, that one ) in which the researcher says the social network had been exploring the use of linguistic data to infer personality traits. Now, that researcher, like many others , is doubtful psychographic targeting is really effective and said the method raises some “distinctive ethical concerns.”\nBest of the rest Nestlé has reportedly launched a review to consolidate portions of its North American advertising business with four to six agencies as the confectionery giant looks to cut costs. [ Adweek ]\nThe European Union’s antitrust authorities are launching a probe into Apple’s proposed acquisition of Shazam over concerns it could reduce choice for users of music-streaming services. [ WSJ ]\nMarket research company YouGov is testing use of blockchain to deposit a micropayment in panelists’ accounts in exchange for their consent allowing third-party companies using their data. The blockchain solution alerts consumers when their data is used and records it in a public digital ledger. [ AdExchanger ]\nViacom has struck a deal allowing it to use Comcast’s anonymized set-top box data from cable subscribers and technology from the Freewheel video ad-management business. In return, Comcast will share Viacom’s targeted advertising tools. [ MediaPost ]\nFacebook said it removed 1.9 million pieces of content related to terrorism in the first three months of the year and that 99% of that content was flagged by its own internal systems, rather than being reported by users. [ Bloomberg ]\nChinese tech firms have apologized after a report from campaign group Human Rights Watch found companies and government agencies had published discriminatory recruitment ads, such as asking for male-only candidates or “aesthetically pleasing” women applicants. [ BBC ]\nVanity Fair has launched a metered paywall, offering four free articles a month before visitors are asked to subscribe.
