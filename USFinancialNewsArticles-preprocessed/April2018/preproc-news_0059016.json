    "text": "By Julian Barnes\nBRUSSELS—New Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tantalized U.S. allies meeting here on Friday by keeping the door open to preserving the Iran nuclear deal, but said absent “a substantial fix” Mr. Trump would exit the pact next month.\nMr. Pompeo is a longtime critic of the international agreement forged in the Obama administration to ease sanctions on Iran in return for curbs on its nuclear program. He said he was talking with allies about how to fix what he said were the deal’s flaws.\nFor the next two weeks, the future of the Iran deal is set to be the largest issue looming over trans-Atlantic relations. European officials are fighting to preserve the agreement in talks with a new U.S. foreign policy team that shares President Donald Trump’s deep skepticism toward the 2015 pact.\nFrance, Germany and the U.K. have presented a plan for an additional pact that would seek to curb Iran’s ballistic missile program, intensive inspections and attempt to curb Tehran’s influence the region. It is unclear whether Iran would accept such added restrictions.\nRead an expanded version of this article at WSJ.com. Popular on WSJ.com",
