    "text": "MILWAUKEE, April 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ManpowerGroup (NYSE: MAN) today reported that net earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $97.0 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $74.4 million, or $1.09 cents per diluted share, a year earlier. Revenues for the first quarter were $5.5 billion, an increase of 16% from the prior year period.\nThe current year quarter included restructuring costs which reduced earnings per share by 27 cents.\nFinancial results in the quarter were also significantly impacted by stronger foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar compared to the prior year period. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 5% and net earnings per diluted share increased 20%. Earnings per share in the quarter were positively impacted 14 cents by changes in foreign currencies compared to the prior year, or 17 cents excluding the restructuring costs.\nJonas Prising, ManpowerGroup Chairman & CEO, said, \"We are pleased with the solid start to the year, with strong revenue growth, improved productivity and increased earnings.
