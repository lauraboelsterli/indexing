    "text": "DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Hilltop Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HTH) (“Hilltop”) today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2018. Hilltop produced income of $24.4 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $26.4 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nOn February 14, 2018, Hilltop announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately-held, Houston-based The Bank of River Oaks (“BORO”) in an all-cash transaction. Under the terms of the definitive agreement, Hilltop has agreed to pay cash in the aggregate amount of $85 million to the shareholders and option holders of BORO. As of December 31, 2018, BORO had unaudited total assets, gross loans and deposits of approximately $454 million, $344 million and $406 million, respectively. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and approval by shareholders of BORO, and is expected to close during the third quarter of 2018.\nHilltop also announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per common share, payable on May 31, 2018, to all common stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 15, 2018. Additionally, pursuant to the stock repurchase program authorized by the Hilltop Board of Directors in January 2018, Hilltop paid $1.7 million to repurchase 68,307 shares at an average price of $24.94 during the first quarter of 2018. These shares were returned to the pool of authorized but unissued shares of common stock.\nJeremy Ford, Co-CEO of Hilltop, said, “Our diversified business model with PlainsCapital Bank as the cornerstone continued to demonstrate its resilience, as the bank generated strong earnings and the broker-dealer’s clearing and retail businesses benefited from higher short-term rates, while our mortgage-related businesses endured a challenging environment. We are excited about the pending acquisition of The Bank of River Oaks and accelerating our efforts in the robust Houston market, as we remain focused on building our core banking franchise across Texas.”\nAlan White, Co-CEO of Hilltop, added, “Our markets are increasingly competitive, so our teams are focused on growing revenue by providing best-in-class service to our valued customers. PlainsCapital Bank had a positive first quarter, generating solid net interest income growth while maintaining very strong credit quality. National Lloyds’ earnings were driven by lower storm losses. HilltopSecurities’ fixed income portfolio was adversely impacted by volatility in long-term rates, and PrimeLending experienced tighter gain on sale margins.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights for Hilltop:\nHilltop’s annualized return on average assets and return on average equity for the first quarter of 2018 were 0.77% and 5.19%, respectively, compared to 0.88% and 5.73%, respectively, for the first quarter of 2017; Hilltop’s total assets were $13.3 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $13.4 billion at December 31, 2017; Hilltop’s common equity increased by $10.9 million from December 31, 2017 to $1.9 billion at March 31, 2018; Non-covered loans 1 held for investment, net of allowance for loan losses, decreased by 0.4% to $5.6 billion and covered loans 2 , net of allowance for loan losses, decreased by 6.5% to $167.8 million at March 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017; Non-covered non-performing loans decreased to $39.4 million, or 0.52% of total non-covered loans, at March 31, 2018, compared to $40.5 million, or 0.51% of total non-covered loans, at December 31, 2017; Energy classified and criticized loans were $28.5 million at March 31, 2018, a slight decrease from $28.6 million at December 31, 2017; Loans held for sale decreased by 17.8% from December 31, 2017 to $1.4 billion at March 31, 2018; Total deposits were $8.0 billion at both March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017; Hilltop maintained strong capital levels with a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio 3 of 13.26% and a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 18.60% at March 31, 2018; Hilltop’s net interest margin 4 decreased to 3.52% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 3.57% in the fourth quarter of 2017; The provision (recovery) for loan losses was ($1.8) million during the first quarter of 2018, compared to $5.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017; For the first quarter of 2018, noninterest income was $235.1 million, compared to $271.4 million in the first quarter of 2017, a 13.4% decrease; and For the first quarter of 2018, noninterest expense was $308.2 million, compared to $320.5 million in the first quarter of 2017, a 3.8% decrease; and The Company’s effective tax rate decreased to 23.3% during the first quarter of 2018, compared to 36.4% during the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Legislation”).\n1 “Non-covered loans” exclude broker-dealer margin loans. 2 “Covered loans” refer to loans acquired in the FNB Transaction that are subject to loss-share agreements with the FDIC. 3 Based on the end of period Tier 1 capital divided by total average assets during 2018, excluding goodwill and intangible assets. 4 Net interest margin is defined as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.

Banking Segment results of $28.4 million and $25.7 million, respectively, primarily attributable to the revaluation of deferred tax assets as a result of the enactment of the Tax Legislation. Certain Tax Legislation amounts are considered reasonable estimates as of March 31, 2018 and could be adjusted during the measurement period, which will end in December 2018, as a result of further refinement of our calculations, changes in interpretations and assumptions made, guidance that may be issued and actions we may take as a result of Tax Legislation. (2) Net interest margin is defined as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. (3) Noted measures during the 2017 periods presented reflect certain category reclassifications within the detailed calculations to conform with the current period presentation. (4) Net interest margin (taxable equivalent), a non-GAAP measure, is defined as taxable equivalent net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Taxable equivalent adjustments are based on the applicable 21% federal income tax rate for the 2018 period and 35% federal income tax rate for the 2017 periods. The interest income earned on certain earning assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest margins for all earning assets, we use net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. For the periods presented, the taxable equivalent adjustments to interest income for Hilltop Consolidated were $0.3 million, $0.6 million, $0.6 million, $0.5 million, and $0.5 million, respectively, and for the Banking Segment were $0.2 million, $0.4 million, $0.4 million, $0.4 million, and $0.4 million, respectively. (5) Dividend payout ratio is defined as cash dividends declared per common share divided by basic earnings per common share. (6) Net revenue is defined as the sum of total broker-dealer net interest income plus total broker-dealer noninterest income (7) Reported on a consolidated basis and therefore does not include mortgage servicing rights assets related to loans serviced for the banking segment, which are eliminated in consolidation. (8) Noted measures during the 2017 periods presented reflect certain category reclassifications that affect variable compensation expense to conform with the current period presentation.
