Its shares were up 1.7 percent in premarket trading.\nAnalysts expect quarterly profits for S&P 500 companies to rise 18.5 percent from a year ago, the biggest gain in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nBy 7:01 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 126 points, or 0.52 percent, S&P 500 e-minis rose 14.5 points, or 0.55 percent, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis gained 40 points, or 0.61 percent.\nFinancial markets lost ground on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump warned Russia of imminent military action in Syria over a suspected poison gas attack, declaring that missiles “will be coming”.\nOn Thursday, Trump toned down his threats, tweeting “Never said when an attack on Syria would take place. Could be very soon or not so soon at all!”\nTrump also denied a newspaper report that he had planned to fire U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller late last year. Mueller has been tasked with investigating allegations of Russian meddling in 2016 U.S. presidential election.\nMarkets were also weighed down by the Federal Reserve’s March meeting minutes that showed all the central bank policymakers felt the U.S. economy would firm further and that inflation would rise in the coming months.\nAmong stocks, Bed Bath & Beyond dived more than 15 percent after the company provided lower-than-expected full-year profit forecast.\nShares of Delta Air Lines were marginally up after the U.S. carrier reported a rise in quarterly revenue.\nReporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur\n ",
