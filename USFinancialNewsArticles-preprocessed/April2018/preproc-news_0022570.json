    "text": "TORONTO, April 11, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ECN Capital Corp. (TSX:ECN) (“ ECN Capital ” or the “ Company ”) announced today the preliminary results of its modified “Dutch auction” substantial issuer bid to purchase for cancellation up to $115 million of its outstanding common shares (“ Shares ”) from shareholders for cash (the “ Offer ”). The Offer expired at 5:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on April 10, 2018.\nIn accordance with the terms and conditions of the Offer and based on the preliminary count by Computershare Trust Company of Canada, as depositary for the Offer (the “ Depositary ”), the Company expects to take up and purchase for cancellation approximately 31,944,444 Shares at a purchase price of $3.60 per Share (the “ Purchase Price ”). The Shares expected to be purchased under the Offer represent approximately 8.82% of the Shares issued and outstanding before giving effect to the Offer. After giving effect to the Offer, approximately 330,149,996 Shares are expected to be issued and outstanding.\nBased on the preliminary count by the Depositary, approximately 96,883,148 Shares (including those delivered pursuant to notice of guaranteed delivery) were properly tendered to the Offer and not withdraw at the Purchase Price, of which approximately 36.5 million were tendered at prices of $3.80 per Share or above in the range. As the Offer was oversubscribed, the Company will purchase the successfully tendered Shares on a pro-rata basis following determination of the final results of the Offer, except that “odd lot” tenders (of holders beneficially owning fewer than 100 Shares) will not be subject to pro-ration. The Company expects that tendering shareholders subject to pro-ration will have approximately 84.57% of their tendered Shares purchased by the Company under the Offer.\nThe number of Shares to be purchased under the Offer, the pro-ration factor and the Purchase Price are preliminary and subject to verification by the Depositary. The Company and the Depositary expect to release the final results of the Offer, including the final Purchase Price and pro-ration factor, on or before April 16, 2018. The Company will make the payment for the Shares tendered and accepted for purchase by tendering the aggregate purchase price to the Depositary on or before April 16, 2018 in accordance with the Offer and applicable laws and the Depositary will effect payment to shareholders promptly thereafter. Payment for the Shares will be made in cash, without interest. Any Shares invalidly tendered or tendered and not purchased will be returned to the tendering shareholder promptly by the Depositary.\nThe full terms and conditions of the Offer are described in the offer to purchase and issuer bid circular dated March 5, 2018, as well as the letter of transmittal and other related documents, copies of which were filed and are available on available without charge on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and on the Company’s website at www.ecncapitalcorp.com .\nThis press release is for informational purposes only and does not constitute an offer to buy or the solicitation of an offer to sell Shares.\nAbout ECN Capital Corp.\nWith total owned and managed assets of more than C$5.5 billion, ECN Capital Corp.
