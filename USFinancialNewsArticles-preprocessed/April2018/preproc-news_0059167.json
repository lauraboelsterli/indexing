    "text": "April 25 (Reuters) - British American Tobacco plans to increase investment in next-generation products such as e-cigarettes and devices that heat tobacco without burning it, this year, with a large number of launches planned for the end of third quarter.\nThe world’s second-biggest international tobacco company by revenue has thrown itself into the fiercely competitive battleground of alternatives, but it trails Philip Morris International in tobacco-heating devices that some see as more appealing to smokers.\nBAT said foreign currency exchange rates would be a headwind for the business in 2018, but said it was on track for “another good year” of earnings growth, excluding the impact of currency translation.\nReporting by Arathy S Nair in Bengaluru, editing by Louise\n ",
