    "text": "HOUSTON, April 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- KBR, Inc. (NYSE: KBR), a global provider of differentiated, professional services and technologies across the asset and program life cycle within the government services and hydrocarbons industries today announced first quarter 2018 financial results.\n\"It's an exciting time to be part of the KBR team. End markets are buoyant, backlog and bookings are strong and execution is delivering excellent safety performance and robust margins,\" said Stuart Bradie, KBR President and CEO.\n\"We remain committed to building a portfolio of recurring and predictable professional services and technologies businesses and this strategy is delivering stable revenues year on year (excluding non-strategic) and strong EPS growth. We posted excellent organic growth in our government business, increased sustainable margins in technology and are seeing the recovery in our hydrocarbons business with key wins coupled with earnings growth from last quarter. We were also pleased by our execution across KBR including Ichthys which is performing within the estimates provided in February,\" Bradie continued.\n\"In addition, in April we completed the planned acquisitions of Stinger Ghaffarian Technologies (SGT) and also Carillion's interest in Aspire Defence. These acquisitions advance our portfolio goals and give us additional long-term, stable backlog as a platform for earnings growth.\"\nFirst Quarter Financial Results\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n% Change\nDollars in millions\n2018\n2017\nRevenue\n$\n1,038\n$\n1,106\n(6)\n%\nGross Profit\n$\n81\n$\n82\n(1)\n%\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates\n$\n23\n$\n9\n156\n%\nGain on consolidation of Aspire entities\n$\n115\n$\nâ€”\nN/A\nNet income attributable to KBR\n$\n138\n$\n37\n273\n%\nAdjusted EBITDA (1)\n$\n84\n$\n77\n9\n%\nDiluted EPS\n$\n0.97\n$\n0.26\n273\n%\nAdjusted EPS (1)\n$\n0.34\n$\n0.28\n21\n%\nOperating cash flows\n$\n(130)\n$\n(115)\n(13)\n%\n(1) See additional information at the end of this release regarding non-GAAP financial measures\nEffective fiscal 2018, we are making the following changes in our reporting:\nWe are changing the name of the Engineering & Construction (E&C) segment to the \"Hydrocarbons Services\" segment (HS). This change reflects strategic shifts we have made in this business over recent years to evolve to more recurring and reimbursable engineering, consulting and industrial maintenance services, coupled our de-emphasis in engaging in fixed price EPC projects except for those that fit within our commercial discipline. We have moved the Consulting division formerly reported in the Technology and Consulting segment to the Hydrocarbons Services segment. This aligns with our focus on high technology professional services engagements across the full life cycle of projects in Hydrocarbon end markets.\nRevenue: The decrease in consolidated revenues was primarily driven by completion or substantial completion of several projects within our HS business segment. The decrease was partially offset by the consolidation of newly acquired entities in the Aspire Defence program and strong organic growth of 11% in our GS business segment.\nGross Profit: The consolidation of the Aspire Defence entities coupled with strong organic growth in our GS business segment and increased gross profits in the Technology segment offset decreases in gross profits from the HS segment caused by completion or substantial completion of several projects.\nEquity in earnings: The increase in equity in earnings was driven by progress on the Ichthys project within our HS business segment. In the prior year first quarter, Ichthys was impacted by increases in estimated costs to complete the project, which adversely impacted equity in earnings in Q1 2017.\nGain on consolidation of Aspire entities: The gain was recognized upon consolidation of the Aspire entities as a result of adjusting our investment to fair value as required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nOperating cash flow: The cash used in operations totaled $130 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to cash used of $115 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. Operating cash flows were unfavorably impacted by timing delays in billing and collections in the GS segment which are expected to be resolved in Q2 2018.\nNew Business:\nGovernment Services\nWe were awarded a $42 million contract by the U.K. Ministry of Defence to bring into service a water purification, storage and distribution system to deliver potable water to deployed U.K. forces. We were awarded a $32 million task order to assist the U.S. Air Force in enhancing the operational capability and efficiency of air and space systems. We were awarded a $34 million task order to provide analytical and engineering weapons systems support to assist the U.S. Air Force with air traffic safety and cyber threats. We were awarded a $69 million indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract to provide engineering and technical services to the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division.\nTechnology\nWe were awarded an ammonia plant contract by Toyo Engineering Corporation to provide licensing and basic engineering design services for the HURL project in Gorakhpur, India. We were awarded a license and engineering contract by ENAP Refinerias SA to utilize our ROSE solvent deasphalting technology at their refinery in Chile. We have entered into an agreement with PT Panca Amara Utama to provide our Ammonia InSite technology for their ammonia plant complex in Indonesia.\nHydrocarbons Services\nWe were awarded (April) a significant reimbursable pre FEED and FEED for a major petrochemicals complex in the ME. We were awarded a FEED leading to reimbursable EPC for a refinery expansion for a tier 1 customer in Texas.\nKBR backlog increased from $10.6 billion as of December 31, 2017 to $13.2 billion as of March 31, 2018, primarily due to the inclusion of 100% of backlog associated with the consolidated Aspire entities and new awards, partially offset by workoff and other adjustments. Excluding Aspire, GS backlog improved by $150 million. Technology segment backlog improved by $36 million.\nGuidance\nWe are re-affirming the company's full year 2018 fully diluted adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $1.35 to $1.45 per share. Our guidance of earnings per share is on an adjusted EPS basis, which excludes legacy legal costs for U.S. Government contracts, acquisition & integration-related expenses associated with the Aspire and SGT acquisitions, new amortization associated with the Aspire acquisitions and the gain on the Aspire consolidation. The estimated legacy legal costs do not assume any cost reimbursement from the U.S. Government that could occur in the future. A reconciliation of GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS guidance is located at the end of this release.\nOur estimated effective tax rate for 2018 is unchanged and estimated to range from 22% to 24%. The operating cash flows are also unchanged and estimated to range from $125 million to $175 million for 2018.\nAbout KBR, Inc.\nKBR is a global provider of differentiated professional services and technologies across the asset and program life cycle within the Government Services and Hydrocarbons sectors.

realize in the future as a result of performing work on contracts and our pro-rata share of work to be performed by unconsolidated joint ventures. We generally include total expected revenues in backlog when a contract is awarded under a legally binding agreement. In many instances, arrangements included in backlog are complex, nonrepetitive and may fluctuate due to the release of contracted work in phases by the customer. Additionally, nearly all contracts allow customers to terminate the agreement at any time for convenience. Where contract duration is indefinite and clients can terminate for convenience without having to compensate us for periods beyond the date of termination, projects included in backlog are limited to the estimated amount of expected revenues within the following twelve months. Certain contracts provide maximum dollar limits, with actual authorization to perform work under the contract agreed upon on a periodic basis with the customer. In these arrangements, only the amounts authorized are included in backlog. For projects where we act solely in a project management capacity, we only include the value of our services on each project in backlog.\nWe define backlog, as it relates to U.S. government contracts, as our estimate of the remaining future revenue from existing signed contracts over the remaining base contract performance period (including customer approved option periods) for which work scope and price have been agreed with the customer. We define funded backlog as the portion of backlog for which funding currently is appropriated, less the amount of revenue we have previously recognized. We define unfunded backlog as the total backlog less the funded backlog. Our GS backlog does not include any estimate of future potential delivery orders that might be awarded under our government-wide acquisition contracts, agency-specific indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts, or other multiple-award contract vehicles nor does it include option periods that have not been exercised by the customer.\nWithin our GS business segment, we calculate estimated backlog for long-term contracts associated with the U.K. government's privately financed initiatives or projects (\"PFIs\") based on the aggregate amount that our client would contractually be obligated to pay us over the life of the project. We update our estimates of the future work to be executed under these contracts on a quarterly basis and adjust backlog if necessary.\nWe have included in the table above our proportionate share of unconsolidated joint ventures' estimated revenues. Since these projects are accounted for under the equity method, only our share of future earnings from these projects will be recorded in our results of operations. Our proportionate share of backlog for projects related to unconsolidated joint ventures totaled $3.0 billion at March 31, 2018 and $7.2 billion at December 31, 2017. Our backlog included in the table above for projects related to consolidated joint ventures with noncontrolling interest includes 100% of the backlog associated with those joint ventures and totaled $6.9 billion at March 31, 2018 and $125 million at December 31, 2017.\nWe estimate that as of March 31, 2018, 29% of our backlog will be executed within one year. Of this amount, 72% will be recognized in revenues on our condensed consolidated statement of operations and 28% will be recorded by our unconsolidated joint ventures. As of March 31, 2018, $107 million of our backlog relates to active contracts that are in a loss position.\nAs of March 31, 2018, 8% of our backlog was attributable to fixed-price contracts, 69% was attributable to PFIs and 23% of our backlog was attributable to cost-reimbursable contracts. For contracts that contain both fixed-price and cost-reimbursable components, we classify the individual components as either fixed-price or cost-reimbursable according to the composition of the contract; however, for smaller contracts, we characterize the entire contract based on the predominant component. As of March 31, 2018, $10.4 billion of our GS backlog was currently funded by our customers.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThe following information provides reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial measures presented in the press release to which this reconciliation is attached to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The company has provided the non-GAAP financial information presented in the press release, which is not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as information supplemental and in addition to the financial measures presented in the press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented in the press release. The non-GAAP financial measures in the press release may differ from similar measures used by other companies.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe evaluate performance based on Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Net income (loss) attributable to KBR, plus interest expense, net; provision (benefit) for income taxes; other non-operating expense (income); and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA for each of the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the SEC's rules because Adjusted EBITDA for each such period excludes certain amounts not excluded in the calculation of net income attributable to KBR in accordance with GAAP for such periods. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA for each of the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is a meaningful measure to share with investors because each measure, which adjusts net income attributable to KBR for such periods for certain items recorded in such periods, is the measure that best allows comparison of the performance for the comparable period. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA affords investors a view of what management considers KBR's core performance for each of the three months and fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 and also affords investors the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core performance for the comparable periods.\nThree Months Ended March 31,\nDollars in millions\n2018\n2017\nNet Income Attributable to KBR\n$\n138\n$\n37\nAdd Back:\nInterest expense\n6\n5\nProvision for income taxes\n34\n13\nOther non-operating expense\n2\n7\nDepreciation and amortization\n13\n13\nConsolidated EBITDA\n$\n193\n$\n75\nAdd Back:\nLegacy legal fees\n3\n2\nAcquisition and integration related costs\n3\nâ€”\nGain on consolidation of Aspire entities\n(115)\nâ€”\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n84\n$\n77\nAdjusted EPS\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share from net income attributable to KBR (Adjusted EPS) for each of the three months and fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the SEC's rules because the Adjusted EPS for each such period excludes certain amounts not excluded in the diluted earnings per share from net income attributable to KBR calculated in accordance with GAAP (EPS) for such periods. Management believes that the Adjusted EPS for each of the three months and fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is a meaningful measure to share with investors because each measure, which adjusts EPS for such periods for certain items recorded in such periods, is the measure that best allows comparison of the performance for the comparable period. In addition, Adjusted EPS affords investors a view of what management considers KBR's core earnings performance for each of the three months and fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 and also affords investors the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance for the comparable periods.\nWe have calculated Adjusted EPS for each of the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 by adjusting EPS for the items included in the table below. Adjusted EPS for each of the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is a non-GAAP financial measure. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is Diluted EPS for the same periods.\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nDiluted earnings per share:\nReported EPS\n$\n0.97\n$\n0.26\nAdjustment:\nLegacy legal costs\n$\n0.01\n$\n0.02\nAcquisition and integration related costs\n$\n0.02\n$\nâ€”\nAmortization related to acquisitions\n$\n0.01\n$\nâ€”\nAspire gain on consolidation\n$\n(0.67)\n$\nâ€”\nAdjusted EPS\n$\n0.34\n$\n0.28\nWe have calculated the Adjusted EPS for the 2018 guidance by adjusting EPS for the items included in the table below.\nLow\nHigh\nDiluted earnings per share:\nEPS Guidance\n$\n1.85\n$\n1.95\nAdjustments:\nLegacy Legal Fees\n$\n0.07\n$\n0.07\nAcquisition & Integration Related Expenses\n$\n0.04\n$\n0.04\nAmortization Related to Aspire Acquisition\n0.06\n0.06\nAspire Gain on Consolidation\n$\n(0.67)\n$\n(0.67)\nAdjusted EPS\n$\n1.35\n$\n1.45\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kbr-announces-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-300636913.html\nSOURCE KBR, Inc.",
