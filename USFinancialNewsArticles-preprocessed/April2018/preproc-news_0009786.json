    "text": "209 COMMENTS Drivers who routinely don’t pay tolls in Pennsylvania could be convicted of a felony.\nThe Keystone State’s Turnpike Commission has begun to file criminal charges against motorists it deems egregious scofflaws. The recent initiative involves enlisting local prosecutors to pursue theft of services criminal cases, which reach felony status when the sum owed exceeds $2,000.\nRelated\nHow America’s Most Important Highway Fails The Future of America’s Economy Looks a Lot Like Elkhart, Ind. Why Are States So Strapped for Cash? Two Big Reasons Speed-Limit Boosts Show No Signs of Slowing Down The state’s top 100 toll evaders each have more than $21,000 in unpaid tolls and fines. One driver is accused of racking up more than $90,000 in debts since 2012, mostly in snowballing fines, by using an E-ZPass-only lane more than 1,600 times without a valid transponder, according to a criminal complaint.\nPennsylvania is “clearly stepping up the game. I haven’t heard of anyone going to this level before,” said Neil Gray, government affairs director at the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association, which represents toll facility owners and operators.\nThough Pennsylvania’s recent tactics stand out, toll agencies around the U.S. are also boosting efforts to ensure drivers pay. The heightened focus on collecting unpaid tolls is linked to the move from toll booths to all-electronic tolling. In such cashless systems , transponders like an E-ZPass device provide instant payment. For a car without a transponder, a camera photographs the license plate, and the owner gets a bill in the mail or pays online.\nTolls collected are used to maintain and upgrade the roads as well as to pay the bonds borrowed to build them. Unpaid tolls cost the Pennsylvania Turnpike about $17 million a year, a fraction of the $1.1 billion in overall toll revenue.\nThe share of toll revenue collected in cash fell to 18% in 2015, from 29% in 2010, according to the association’s 2016 survey of three dozen large U.S. toll agencies. Cashless transactions accounted for more than $11 billion in revenue for those agencies in 2015, the report said.\nSome agencies, such as the North Texas Tollway Authority, are entirely cashless. The Pennsylvania Turnpike uses a paper ticket system on much of its network, but a plan under consideration would convert the entire network to cashless tolling in 2022.\nCommon Toll Violations\nVehicle uses cashless lane without E-ZPass transponder Transponder identification fails Insufficient funds in E-ZPass account Cash customer takes ticket on entry but exits through E-ZPass lane The industry says cashless tolling reduces congestion because drivers don’t need to slow down. But without “a forced mechanism to stop people,” the risk of toll violations rises, said Pat Jones, chief executive of the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association. “I think the industry has responded,” he said.\nFlorida’s Turnpike Enterprise in late 2015 launched a program that prevents a plate-holder from renewing a Florida license plate until all tolls are paid. The system credits that process with a 15% drop in unpaid toll revenue from fiscal 2016 to 2017.\nThe North Texas Tollway Authority in 2016 fully rolled out an effort aimed at motorists with at least 100 unpaid tolls in 12 months.\nSome toll agencies name and shame. The Illinois Tollway publishes a quarterly list of “super scofflaws” who owe at least $1,000. A recent version had 469 names, including many trucking firms, with the top violator allegedly $890,000 in arrears.\nIn New York City, Metropolitan Transportation Authority bridge-and-tunnel police and the State Police use license-plate readers to identify and stop vehicles whose registrations have been suspended for persistent toll violations. Police give the driver a summons and impound the car. Since January 2017, more than 1,200 vehicles have been stopped, the MTA says.\nThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department periodically arrests toll evaders who have large toll debts , a spokesman said.\nFor years the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission had minimal power to pursue scofflaws. It could only send violation notices and turn an account over to collections. Last year, a new state law allowed officials to suspend Pennsylvania vehicle registrations for unpaid toll debts.\nThe turnpike commission’s chief executive, Mark Compton, wondered if officials could also use criminal courts, according to Ray Morrow, the turnpike’s chief of compliance. Mr. Morrow researched state law and concluded that theft of services applied.\nSo far the commission has filed 13 private criminal complaints. A judge has approved a payment plan in one case, and the others are pending, Mr. Morrow said.\n“When people find out we’re actually going after people criminally, it’s going to make a huge impact,” Mr. Morrow said, adding he hopes fewer people will try to dodge tolls.\nAlready the potential for criminal prosecution has helped spur payments or agreed-upon payment plans expected to bring in more than $120,000, he said.\nAmong those facing a felony charge is Lori Yearick of Mount Joy, Pa.\nA criminal complaint alleges she incurred 1,645 violations between early 2012 and March 2017. It says she received 6,580 notices in that span. Unpaid tolls account for about $26,000 of her roughly $92,000 balance, the complaint says, and fees total nearly $66,000.\nHer lawyer, Edward Spreha Jr. , said he is still reviewing the evidence. “Certainly if they can prove she in fact did this, we want to make sure the turnpike is made whole,” he said. “We also have to make sure her ability to repay is going to be taken into consideration.”\nWrite to Scott Calvert at scott.calvert@wsj.com",
