    "text": "MOORESTOWN, N.J., April 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Destination Maternity Corporation (NASDAQ: DEST), the world's leading maternity apparel retailer, today announced that Pierre-André Mestre, Chairman of the Board of Directors of French children's clothing retailer Orchestra-Prémaman, and Jean-Claude Jacomin, an accomplished international C-Suite executive, have been elected to and seated on the Company's Board of Directors. With these additions, Destination's Board will expand to six members. Messrs. Mestre and Jacomin will be included in the Company's slate of six nominees for election to the Board at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\nDestination Maternity also announced the Board's creation of a new Business Initiatives Committee consisting of Messrs. Mestre and Jacomin, Barry Erdos, Chairman of Destination's Board, and Melissa Payner-Gregor, a director and interim chief executive officer. The Business Initiatives Committee, which will be chaired by Mr. Erdos, will work with Destination's senior management to identify and recommend to the full Board innovative ideas to improve operational performance and sales for the benefit of all stockholders.\n\"The Board has been actively pursuing the addition of new members to expand the skills and experience on the Board to accelerate Destination Maternity's turnaround and path to profitable growth. In keeping with this objective, I am pleased to announce the addition of Pierre and Jean-Claude to the Destination Maternity Board,\" said Barry Erdos, Chairman of Destination Maternity. \"Pierre is a natural choice for the Board. He represents our largest stockholder group, and as Chairman and founder of Orchestra-Prémaman, he understands the opportunities and challenges of operating a childrenswear and maternity business. Jean-Claude is equally suited given his track record of success, including as Group President of Juvenile products at Dorel, where he guided the turnaround of the business in North America and successfully implemented new product, marketing, and supply chain strategies. We look forward to Pierre's and Jean-Claude's contributions as well as the continued value enhancing efforts of our other members. The Company has already seen its strategies gain traction with notable strength in its ecommerce channel following the upgrade of its web platform.\"\n\"I am extremely excited to join Destination's Board of Directors and assist the Company in capitalizing on its leadership position in maternity apparel in the United States,\" said Mr. Mestre. \"I believe there are many opportunities that are available to Destination Maternity to drive new sales and expand operating margin and look forward to assisting the Company and my fellow Board members in achieving this goal.\"\nMr. Jacomin added, \"I am delighted to join the Destination Maternity Board and believe my experience as a senior leader in the areas of product, marketing and supply chain will benefit the Company and its stockholders. I look forward to working with the full Board to help the Company achieve its potential in a rapidly evolving retail environment.\"\nDestination Maternity also announced that it has entered into a support agreement with Orchestra-Prémaman and affiliates which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAbout Pierre-André Mestre\nPierre-André Mestre currently serves as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Orchestra-Prémaman S.A., a French-based clothing retailer specializing in maternity, children's fashions and childcare products.

Prior to founding Orchestra-Prémaman S.A., he set up and served as a Marketing and Development Manager of a German subsidiary of Kidiliz Group (f/k/a Zannier Group), a French-based children's clothing retailer. Orchestra-Prémaman S.A. has become a major player in the European childcare products market, in particular due to external growth operations, such as the acquisition of Baby 2000 and the Prémaman Group, which is Europe's oldest maternity wear brand, dating back to 1947. Having increased its presence internationally, the Group now operates 565 shops in more than 40 countries, selling more than 80 million pieces per year.\nAbout Jean Claude Jacomin\nJean Claude Jacomin currently serves as President of Glocal Performance Consulting SAS, a French-based consulting firm he founded, providing its corporate clients with strategic counsel related to domestic and international expansion.

At Dorel, he enjoyed increasing levels of responsibility, ascending to the Group President & CEO of the Juvenile Segment, where he oversaw over $1.2 billion in sales and 7500 people across 25 countries.
