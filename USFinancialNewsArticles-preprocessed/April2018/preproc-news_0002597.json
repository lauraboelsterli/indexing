    "text": "ClickIPO and TradeStation Announce Arrangement to Provide IPO and Secondary Offering Access to TradeStation Clients\nSCOTTSDALE, Ariz., April 04, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ClickIPO Securities, LLC (“ClickIPO”) and TradeStation Securities, Inc. (“TradeStation”) , a Monex Group company and award-winning* online broker-dealer and futures commission merchant, are making the ClickIPO platform available to eligible TradeStation clients so they may gain access to ClickIPO’s marketplace of initial public offerings, secondary offerings and follow-on offerings (collectively, “Public Offerings”).\nThe ClickIPO app for iOS and Android, available through ClickIPO, allows eligible individual investors to participate in certain Public Offerings. “We offer a simple solution that enables the small investor to invest in available offerings at the public offering price,” said Scott Coyle, CEO of ClickIPO.\nTradeStation clients can now download the ClickIPO app free of charge from the Apple App Store or Google Play store. Alternatively, people interested in the opportunity can apply for a TradeStation account via a link on the ClickIPO app. Eligible TradeStation clients can then access the ClickIPO app, review available Public Offerings and place conditional orders to participate. If a TradeStation customer receives an allocation, the shares will be deposited into the customer's TradeStation account.\nClickIPO aggregates conditional orders and sends one consolidated order to the underwriter. Once ClickIPO receives an allocation from the underwriter, individual investors receive shares of the offering in their TradeStation account in accordance with ClickIPO’s investor score algorithm. Investors may receive all, some or none of the shares requested depending on supply, demand and their investor score.\n“The ClickIPO app provides a new opportunity for TradeStation clients to participate in Public Offerings,” said John Bartleman, President of TradeStation Group, Inc., TradeStation’s parent company. “We’re pleased to enter an arrangement with ClickIPO to make this value-added feature available to TradeStation clients.”\nFor current TradeStation clients, please follow this link to connect the ClickIPO app. If you do not have a TradeStation account, you must apply and be approved for, open and fund a TradeStation brokerage account and then connect to the ClickIPO app.\nThe ClickIPO feature is available to qualified TradeStation clients who maintain a minimum balance of $5,000 in their equities brokerage account (retirement accounts like IRAs and SEP IRAs are not eligible).\nFor more information, please contact info@clickipo.com or Sales@TradeStation.com .\nAbout ClickIPO\nClickIPO Securities, LLC, a registered broker-dealer, exclusively offers the mobile ClickIPO platform designed to give Individual Investors access to hundreds of IPOs and Secondary Offerings each year.
