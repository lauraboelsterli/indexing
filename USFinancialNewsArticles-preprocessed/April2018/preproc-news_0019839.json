FILE PHOTO: Britain Tennis - Aegon Championships - Queens Club, London - 19/6/16 Actor Kevin Spacey watches from the stands during the final Action Images via Reuters / Tony O'Brien Livepic \nThe Oscar-winning actor was fired from the Netflix series “House of Cards” last year after he was accused of sexual misconduct. The spokesman Greg Risling said that the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department presented its case to prosecutors on April 5. \nSpacey’s lawyer and spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \nMore than 30 men have made allegations against Spacey. He has apologised to one of his accusers but was erased from the movie “All the Money in the World” and written out of “House of Cards.” \nNBC News first reported on Wednesday that a sexual assault case against Spacey had been presented.
