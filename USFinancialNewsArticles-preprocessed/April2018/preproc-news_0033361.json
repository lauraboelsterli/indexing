    "text": "* Tanzania has tightened controls over online content\n* New rules reflect conservative shift under Magufuli\n* Two singers face possible jail sentence, fines over clips\nBy Fumbuka and Ng’wanakilala\nDAR ES SALAAM, April 17 (Reuters) - Tanzania has arrested two musicians, including one of the country’s most popular singers, after they posted video clips deemed obscene by the authorities, in the latest crackdown on social media users.\nTanzania has become more socially conservative since the election of President John Magufuli in late 2015. Last month, the government tightened regulations on online content, imposing licence fees for bloggers and threatening internet users with criminal charges for posting hate speech or indecent content.\nAward-winning 28-year old singer Nassib Abdul, whose stage name is Diamond Platnumz, was arrested after sharing a video clip with his 4.5 million followers on Instagram that showed him kissing a girl.\n“Star musician Diamond was arrested by the police yesterday and is being questioned over the online content he posted,” Tanzania Information, Sports and Culture Minister Harrison Mwakyembe said in parliament on Tuesday.\nMwakyembe said another local musician, 26-year old Faustina Charles, popularly known as Nandy, was also arrested for posting a video clip of her and another musician via WhatsApp that the minister said was “indecent”. He did not elaborate.\nDiamond deleted his video clip after posting it but it has continued to circulate on social media. The video clip with Nandy also went viral on WhatsApp but it was unclear who had originally posted it.\nMwakyembe said the authorities plan to file criminal charges against the two musicians.\nIf convicted, the singers could face a fine of at least 5 million shillings ($2,200) or a prison sentence of a minimum of 12 months or both.\nSAFEGUARDING CULTURE “I would like to urge the youth to stop using the internet to post obscene content. The government will continue to safeguard the country’s culture for present and future generations,” Mwakyembe said, citing a law passed in 2010, the Electronic and Postal Communications Act.\nUnder Magufuli, a Christian in a country that also has a sizeable Muslim population, Tanzanian authorities have vowed to crack down on homosexuality, which is illegal, and indecent exposure.\nThough laws governing moral and sexual issues have mostly long been in place, their enforcement was fairly relaxed under the more liberal government of Magufuli’s predecessor, Jakaya Kikwete, who retired as president in 2015 after a 10-year rule.\nMagufuli said last year it was immoral for young girls to be sexually active and rejected activists’ calls for the government to allow pregnant students to attend state schools.\nActivists have accused his government of infringing free speech and democracy in its crackdown on internet users.\nThe Paris-based Reporters Without Borders said last week the new online content rules “will kill off Tanzania’s blogosphere”.\nThe number of internet users in Tanzania rose 16 percent in 2017 to 23 million, with the majority of those using their mobile phone handsets to go online in the nation of around 52 million people.\nLast week, neighbouring Uganda, another East African nation moving to regulate internet use, announced plans to slap a new tax on social media users to boost state revenues.
