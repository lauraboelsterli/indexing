Operations review\nTraverse's capital program of $17.7 million in 2017 was allocated one third to maintaining the Company's production and reserves base and two thirds to developing a new Duvernay shale oil prospect area. Traverse drilled five wells (100%) in 2017 resulting in two producing oil wells, two uneconomic wells which were subsequently abandoned, and one Duvernay well at Chigwell. Production averaged 768 BOE/day in 2017 compared to 690 BOE/day in 2016. Proved reserves at December 31, 2017 increased 4% over the prior year and proved plus probable reserves increased 3% over December 31, 2016.\nIn the Coyote area, Traverse drilled, completed and tied-in a Mannville horizontal oil well. In the Coyote West area, an exploration well was drilled and production tested, however the well was deemed uneconomic and subsequently abandoned. In the Watts area, an oil well drilled in 2016 was placed on production and an exploratory well drilled in the first quarter was abandoned as uneconomic. A small 3-D seismic survey was completed early in the third quarter to delineate an Ellerslie oil pool. Subsequently, a successful oil well was drilled at Watts and placed on production. A reservoir study of the Ellerslie oil pool was completed in the first quarter of 2018 and further development drilling is anticipated.\nAs a result of the continuing depressed commodity environment, Traverse postponed additional horizontal drilling at Coyote and accelerated a land accumulation strategy in the Duvernay shale oil basin. Traverse continued to acquire both crown and freehold lands throughout the third and fourth quarters of 2017. Traverse's Duvernay holdings at December 31, 2017 were approximately 83,000 acres (100%). In October 2017 the Company drilled a Duvernay horizontal well in the Chigwell area. The Duvernay well was completed from late November to early December and began production testing on December 21, 2017.\nIn early January 2018, the production fluid began to show oil recovery with a gravity of 33 o API. For the months of January and February 2018 the well produced 2,128 barrels of oil and 36,042 barrels of load water with an average oil cut of 5.6%. In March 2018 the well produced 1,290 barrels of oil and 15,680 barrels of load water with an average oil cut of 7.6%. Total load water recovered to March 31, 2018 was 59,300 barrels, which is 23% of the completion fluids. The well will be shut-in for a period of time over spring break-up during which a pressure survey will be performed.\nIn 2017 Traverse's land expiries and surrenders totalled 74,180 net acres. The Company purchased approximately 62,300 net undeveloped acres (100%) in the Duvernay oil basin during the year. Undeveloped land holdings in Alberta at December 31, 2017 totalled 178,800 gross (178,200 net) acres. Traverse continues to evaluate existing and acquired lands for additional prospects. At December 31, 2017 Traverse had a working capital deficiency of $4.9 million and an undrawn credit facility of $7 million. The credit facility was subsequently reviewed and increased to $9 million subject to the next scheduled review on or before May 31, 2019. The initial exploration and development program for 2018 has been approved at $15 million.\n2017 Reserves report\nTraverse’s independent reserve report, dated February 20, 2018, was prepared by Sproule Associates Limited (“Sproule”) in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 effective December 31, 2017.\nSummary of oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2017\nCompany proved reserves of 1,775.8 MBOE – 4% increase year over year Company proved plus probable reserves of 2,227.2 MBOE – 3% increase year over year Company proved developed producing reserves represent 60% of total proved reserves Company proved reserves constitute 80% of total proved plus probable reserves Net present value of future net revenue attributable to the reserves (before tax) discounted at 10% is $28.3 million for the proved reserves and $35.6 million for the proved plus probable reserves Undiscounted total future development capital for the proved and proved plus probable reserves is $8.2 million Company proved plus probable reserves are comprised of 58% oil and natural gas liquids and 42% natural gas\nThe following tables are a summary of Traverse’s petroleum and natural gas reserves, as evaluated by Sproule, effective December 31, 2017, using Sproule’s forecast prices and costs. It should not be assumed that the estimates of future net revenue presented in the tables below represent the fair market value of the reserves. There is no assurance that the forecast prices and cost assumptions will be attained and variances could be material. The recovery and reserve estimates of the Company’s crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas reserves provided herein are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered. Actual reserves may be greater or less than the estimates provided herein.

Forward-looking information involves risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual events, results, performance, prospects and opportunities to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking information. Forward-looking information in this news release includes: the Company’s statements with respect to further development drilling at Watts; the intention to shut-in the Chigwell Duvernay well over spring break-up; Traverse’s 2018 capital budget; the volumes of reserves attributable to the Company’s assets; and the estimate of the net present value of the future net revenue attributable thereto. This forward looking information is subject to a variety of substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual events or outcomes to differ materially from those anticipated or implied by such forward looking information. The Company’s Annual Information Form filed on April 5, 2018 with securities regulatory authorities (accessible through the SEDAR website www.sedar.com ) describes the risks, material assumptions and other factors that could influence actual results and which are incorporated herein by reference.\nAlthough the Company believes that the material assumptions and factors used in preparing the forward-looking information in this news release are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on such information, which only applies as of the date of this news release, and no assurance can be given that such events will occur. The Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or review any forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, other than as required by law.\nNon-IFRS measures\nIn this release references are made to certain financial measures such as “adjusted funds flow”, “adjusted funds flow per share” and “netback” which do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures by other entities. Management uses certain industry benchmarks such as netbacks to analyze financial and operating performance. There are no comparable measures in accordance with IFRS for operating or corporate netback. Management believes that in addition to net income (loss), the non-IFRS measures set forth below are useful supplemental measures as they assist in the determination of the Company's operating performance, leverage and liquidity. Investors should be cautioned however, that these measures should not be construed as an alternative to both net income (loss) and cash from operating activities, which are determined in accordance with IFRS, as indicators of the Company's performance.\nAdjusted funds flow represents cash from operating activities prior to changes in non-cash working capital and settlement of decommissioning obligations as detailed below:\nThree months ended December 31 (unaudited) Year ended December 31 ($) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Cash from operating activities (153,142 ) 238,406 3,419,743 2,247,464 Decommissioning expenditures 48,819 32,412 178,052 93,111 Change in non-cash working capital 985,037 133,350 639,983 (617,242 ) Adjusted funds flow 880,714 404,168 4,237,778 1,723,333 Adjusted funds flow per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding consistent with the calculation of net income (loss) per share. Operating and corporate netbacks are also presented. Operating netback represents revenue less royalties, operating and transportation costs. Corporate netback represents the operating netback less general and administrative expenses and finance income and costs before accretion. Netback per BOE is the applicable netback divided by barrels of oil production for the applicable period. The calculation of Traverse's operating and corporate netbacks are detailed under the applicable headings within the Company’s management’s discussion and analysis for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nBOE equivalent\nThe term “BOE” or barrels of oil equivalent may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent (6 Mcf: 1 bbl) is based upon an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent value equivalency at the wellhead. Additionally, given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil, as compared to natural gas, is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion ratio of 6:1 may be misleading as an indication of value.\nFor more information, please contact:\nTraverse Energy Ltd.\nLaurie Smith\nPresident and CEO\nApril 5, 2018\n403-264-9223\nFurther details on the Company including the 2017 year end audited financial statements, the related management’s discussion and analysis and Annual Information Form are available on the Company’s website ( www.traverseenergy.com ) and SEDAR.\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accept responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of the content of this release.\nSource: Traverse Energy Ltd.",
