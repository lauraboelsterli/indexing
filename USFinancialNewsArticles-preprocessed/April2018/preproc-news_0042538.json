    "text": "ZURICH, April 19 (Reuters) - Food group Nestle confirmed its full-year guidance after organic sales growth accelerated to 2.8 percent in the first quarter of 2018, helped by improving volumes.\nPackaged food companies have seen their sales slow as consumers prefer fresh foods, deemed healthier and more natural, and have reacted with cost-cutting measures, portfolio management and increasing innovation efforts.\nThe maker of KitKat chocolate bars and Maggi soups confirmed on Thursday its target to grow organic sales by 2-4 percent this year and improve its trading operating margin.
