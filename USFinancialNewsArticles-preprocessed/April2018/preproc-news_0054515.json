(Nasdaq:CDK) today announced financial results for its fiscal 2018 third quarter, ended March 31, 2018.\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Results\nYear-over-year highlights are below:\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Results GAAP Adjusted Revenues up 4% to $576.6 million up 4% to $576.6 million Earnings before income taxes up 22% to $135.0 million up 12% to $166.8 million Net earnings attributable to CDK up 24% to $96.1 million up 17% to $115.5 million Diluted net earnings attributable to CDK per share up 34% to $0.71 per share up 27% to $0.85 per share Margin Net earnings attributable to CDK margin up 280 bps to 16.7% EBITDA margin up 400 bps to 36.5% “I’m pleased to report another quarter of margin expansion and double digit earnings growth,” said Brian MacDonald, chief executive officer. “As we continue making progress towards our transformation goals and adjusted EBITDA margin targets, we are also making a number of investments into the business to drive our growth strategy. Those investments include ground-breaking innovations like our Drive Flex cloud-based DMS and the Fortellis Automotive Commerce Exchange. Both received strong interest from our customers at the recent National Automotive Dealer Association trade show. I’m very proud of the efforts of our CDK Global team who are listening carefully to our customers and delivering on our commitment to be the leading enabler of automotive commerce.”\nPlease refer to the tables at the end of this release for a reconciliation of the GAAP results to the non-GAAP results, which we refer to as our adjusted results throughout the body of this press release. Results below reflect year-over-year comparisons.\nAs described below under the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this press release, effective July 1, 2017, we began incorporating additional adjustments within our calculations of certain adjusted financial measures, including adjusted net earnings attributable to CDK, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. Each adjusted growth rate is shown against a comparably calculated fiscal 2017 figure.\nImpacts to the Third Quarter:\nForeign exchange rates: Growth in revenues and earnings before income taxes were both positively impacted by 2 percentage points by foreign exchange rates.\nTax rate: The GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 27.6% compared to 28.6% in last year’s third quarter. The adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 29.6% compared to 32.9% in last year’s third quarter.\nCDK Segment Information\nCDK North America: Retail Solutions North America\nRevenues increased 1% to $409.3 million. GAAP earnings before income taxes increased 7% to $170.5 million; adjusted earnings before income taxes increased 15% to $182.4 million. On a constant currency basis, earnings before income taxes increased 14%. GAAP pretax margin expanded 240 bps to 41.7%; adjusted pretax margin expanded 530 bps to 44.6%. Margin expansion was primarily driven by revenue and operating efficiencies associated with the business transformation plan as well as lower incentive compensation.\nCDK North America: Advertising North America\nRevenues were roughly flat at $74.2 million. Earnings before income taxes decreased 7% to $9.5 million. Pretax margin declined 90 bps to 12.8% primarily due to a shift in revenue mix.\nCDK International\nRevenues increased 21% to $93.1 million. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 8%. Earnings before income taxes increased 32% to $26.3 million. On a constant currency basis, earnings before income taxes increased 21%. Pretax margin expanded 230 bps to 28.2% primarily due to scale from increased revenues and operating efficiencies associated with the business transformation plan.\nFiscal 2018 Guidance\nFiscal 2018 Guidance GAAP Adjusted Revenues up 2.5% - 3.0% up 2.5% - 3.0% Diluted net earnings attributable\nto CDK per share $2.67 - $2.72 $3.23 - $3.28 up 34.0% - 37.0% up 25.0% - 27.0% Margin Net earnings attributable to CDK margin 16.0% - 17.0% EBITDA margin 35.5% - 36.0%\nWe are reducing our revenue guidance for the fiscal year to 2.5% - 3.0% from 3.0% - 4.0%, primarily due to lower expected advertising revenues. We have narrowed our GAAP earnings per share outlook for the fiscal year to $2.67 - $2.72 and maintained our adjusted earnings per share outlook of $3.23 - $3.28. We expect EBITDA margin to be 35.5% - 36.0% in fiscal 2018, consistent with prior guidance where we expected to be at the high end of the 35.0% - 36.0% range.\nTax Rate\nWe maintain our tax rate expectations for fiscal 2018. We anticipate our GAAP effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 will be 25%-26% compared to 30.5% for fiscal 2017. The adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 is expected to be 29.0%-30.0% compared to 34.2% for fiscal 2017. We continue to evaluate the full impact of the Tax Reform Act, and subject to finalization of our accounting for the Tax Reform Act, we anticipate our future annual adjusted effective tax rate will be approximately three to four points lower than fiscal 2018.\nWebsite Schedules\nOther financial information, including financial statements and supplementary schedules presented on a GAAP and adjusted basis, and the schedule of quarterly revenues and pretax earnings by reportable segment have been updated for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and will be posted to the CDK Investor Relations website, http://investors.cdkglobal.com , in the “Financial Information” section.\nWebcast and Conference Call\nAn analyst conference call will be held today, Thursday, April 26, 2018 at 7:30 a.m. CT.

These measures are intended to provide directional information regarding trends in our recurring subscription revenues. The following table summarizes these measures for recurring subscription revenues in our segments:\nSeptember 30,\n2016 (a) December 31,\n2016 (a) March 31,\n2017 (a) June 30,\n2017 (a) September 30,\n2017 December 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2018 RSNA Automotive DMS Customer Sites (b) 9,232 9,184 9,157 9,081 9,020 9,029 8,917 Avg Revenue Per Site (c) $ 7,803 $ 7,875 $ 7,975 $ 8,070 $ 8,285 $ 8,410 $ 8,483 Adjacencies DMS Customer Sites (b) 5,380 5,415 5,523 5,530 5,523 5,577 5,613 Avg Revenue Per Site (c) $ 1,556 $ 1,569 $ 1,575 $ 1,578 $ 1,602 $ 1,600 $ 1,619 Total RSNA DMS Customer Sites (b) 14,612 14,599 14,680 14,611 14,543 14,606 14,530 Avg Revenue Per Site (c) $ 5,507 $ 5,538 $ 5,570 $ 5,616 $ 5,750 $ 5,814 $ 5,836 Total Websites (d) 6,625 6,789 6,931 6,879 6,858 6,817 6,801 CDKI DMS Customer Sites (b) 13,373 13,424 13,419 13,477 13,496 13,559 13,537 Avg Revenue Per Site (c) $ 1,181 $ 1,199 $ 1,226 $ 1,249 $ 1,266 $ 1,290 $ 1,310 (a) Average revenue per Dealer Management System (DMS) customer site has been updated for fiscal 2017 to reflect budgeted foreign exchange rates for fiscal 2018.\n(b) DMS Customer Sites - We track the number of retail customer sites with an active DMS that sell vehicles in the automotive and adjacent markets as an indicator of our opportunity set for generating subscription revenue. We consider a DMS to be active if we have billed a subscription fee for that solution during the most recently ended calendar month. Adjacent markets include heavy truck dealerships that provide vehicles to the over-the-road trucking industry, recreation dealerships in the motorcycle, marine, and recreational vehicle industries, and heavy equipment dealerships in the agriculture and construction equipment industries.\n(c) Average Revenue Per DMS Customer Site - Average revenue per DMS customer site is an indicator of the adoption of our solutions by DMS customers, and we monitor changes in this metric to measure the effectiveness of our strategy to deepen our relationships with our current customer base through upgrading and expanding solutions. We calculate average revenue per DMS customer site by dividing revenue generated from our solutions, including revenue generated from websites, in an applicable period by the average number of DMS customer sites in the same period. The metric excludes subscription revenue generated by customers not included in our DMS customer site count as well as subscription revenue related to certain installation and training activities that is deferred then recognized as revenue over the life of the contract. Revenue underlying this metric is based on budgeted foreign exchange rates. When we discuss growth in average revenue per DMS customer site, revenue for the comparable prior period has been adjusted to reflect budgeted foreign exchange rates for the current period.\n(d) Websites - For the RSNA segment, we track the number of websites that we host and develop for our OEM and automotive retail customers as an indicator of business activity, regardless of whether or not the website is tied to a DMS customer site. The number of websites as of a specified date is the total number of full function dealer websites or portals that are currently accessible as of the end of the most recent calendar month.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe disclose certain financial measures for our consolidated and operating segment results on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP (adjusted) basis. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our use of each of the following non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non-GAAP financial measures, or reconcile them to the comparable GAAP financial measures, in the same way.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure Comparable GAAP Financial Measure Adjusted earnings before income taxes Earnings before income taxes Adjusted provision for income taxes Provision for income taxes Adjusted net earnings attributable to CDK Net earnings attributable to CDK Adjusted diluted earnings attributable to CDK per share Diluted earnings attributable to CDK per share Adjusted EBITDA Net earnings attributable to CDK Adjusted EBITDA margin Net earnings attributable to CDK margin Constant currency revenues Revenues Constant currency adjusted earnings before income taxes Earnings before income taxes We use adjusted earnings before income taxes, adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted net earnings attributable to CDK, adjusted diluted earnings attributable to CDK per share, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin internally to evaluate our performance on a consistent basis, because the measures adjust for the impact of certain items that we believe do not directly reflect our underlying operations. By adjusting for these items we believe we have more precise inputs for use as factors in (i) our budgeting process, (ii) making financial and operational decisions, (iii) evaluating ongoing segment and overall operating performance on a consistent period-to-period basis, (iv) target leverage calculations, (v) debt covenant calculations, and (vi) determining incentive-based compensation.\nWe believe our non-GAAP financial measures are useful for users of the financial statements because they (i) provide investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items, (ii) permit investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses, and (iii) otherwise provide supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operating results on a consistent basis. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures disclosed below, provides investors with a fuller understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures.\nEffective July 1, 2017, we began incorporating additional adjustments within our calculations of adjusted earnings before income taxes, adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted net earnings attributable to CDK, adjusted diluted net earnings attributable to CDK per share, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin where management has deemed it appropriate to better reflect our underlying operations. For fiscal 2018, management modified fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 adjustments for (i) business transformation expenses and (ii) officer transition expense to remove stock-based compensation expense of $2.5 million and $3.1 million, respectively and excluded certain legal and regulatory expenses related to the competition matter from adjusted earnings before income taxes. There was $1.7 million stock-based compensation expense included in business transformation expenses for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2017.\nAdjusted Earnings before Income Taxes\nManagement has excluded the following items from adjusted earnings before income taxes for the periods presented:\nRestructuring expenses recognized in connection with our business transformation plan.\nOther business transformation expenses included within cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses.\nTotal stock-based compensation expense included within cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses.\nAcquisition and integration-related expenses that include legal, accounting, other professional fees, and other integration costs incurred in connection with assessment and integration of acquisitions included within selling, general and administrative expenses.\nOfficer transition expense includes severance expense in connection with officer departures included within selling, general and administrative expenses for the periods presented.\nLegal and regulatory expenses related to competition matters included within selling, general and administrative expenses.\nNet loss/(gain) recorded within other income, net associated with an indemnification receivable from ADP for pre spin-off tax periods in accordance with tax matters agreement.\nAdjusted Provision for Income taxes\nManagement has excluded the following items from adjusted provision for income taxes for the periods presented:\nIncome tax effect of pre-tax adjustments described above.\nExcess tax benefit derived from stock-option exercises and vesting of restricted stock in order to align the adjustments for this measure with our adjustments for total stock-based compensation in other measures.\nNet income tax benefit associated with a tax refund, offset by a pretax loss to establish a liability to ADP for the tax refund in accordance with the tax-matters agreement.\nAs a result of the Tax reform Act, an estimated one-time tax benefit of $23.4 million from the revaluation of the Company's net deferred tax liability partially offset by a one-time expense of $8.5 million associated with undistributed foreign earnings.\nAdjusted Net Earnings Attributable to CDK and Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Attributable to CDK per Share\nFor each respective presentation, management has excluded the items described above for adjusted earnings before income taxes and adjusted provision for income taxes from adjusted net earnings attributable to CDK and adjusted basic and diluted net earnings attributable to CDK per share.\nThe portion of expense related to noncontrolling interest of $0.1 million and $0.3 million has been removed from restructuring expenses and $0.1 million and $0.2 million has been removed from other business transformation expenses for the three months ended and nine months ended March 31, 2018, respectively. Additionally, $0.1 million related to stock-based compensation expense has been removed from other business transformation expenses for the three months ended and nine months ended March 31, 2018.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nManagement has excluded the following items from net earnings attributable to CDK in order to calculate adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:\nNet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest included within the financial statements.\nProvision for income taxes included within the financial statements.\nInterest expense included within the financial statements.\nDepreciation and amortization included within the financial statements.\nTotal stock-based compensation expense included within cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses.\nRestructuring expenses recognized in connection with our business transformation plan.\nOther business transformation expenses included within cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses. Other business transformation expenses excludes depreciation expense of $0.1 million and $0.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively, and $0.2 million and $2.3 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nAcquisition and integration-related expenses that include legal, accounting, other professional fees, and other integration costs incurred in connection with assessment and integration of acquisitions included within selling, general and administrative expenses.\nOfficer transition expense includes severance expense in connection with officer departures included within selling, general and administrative expenses for the periods presented.\nLegal and regulatory expenses related to competition matters included within selling, general and administrative expenses.\nNet loss/(gain) recorded within other income, net associated with an indemnification receivable from ADP for pre spin-off tax periods in accordance with tax matters agreement.\nFree Cash Flow\nWe also review free cash flow to measure our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities less amounts paid for capital expenditures and capitalized software. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.\nConstant Currency\nWe review revenues and adjusted earnings before income taxes for our consolidated and operating segment results on a constant currency basis to understand underlying business trends. To present these results on a constant currency basis, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar were translated into U.S. dollar using the average monthly exchange rates for the comparable prior period. As a result, constant currency results neutralize the effects of foreign currency.\nSafe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
