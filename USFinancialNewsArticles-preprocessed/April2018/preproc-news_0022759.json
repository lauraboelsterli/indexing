Russia needs us to help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we need all nations to work together. Stop the arms race?” Trump wrote. \n“Great idea!” Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, wrote on Facebook, commenting on Trump’s suggestion. “There is a proposal to start with the destruction of chemical weapons. The American ones,” she wrote. (Reporting by Denis Pinchuk Editing by Andrew Osborn)",
