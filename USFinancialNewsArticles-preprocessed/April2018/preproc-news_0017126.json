    "text": "TSX: GPR\nNYSE AMERICAN: GPL\nVANCOUVER, April 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - GREAT PANTHER SILVER LIMITED (TSX: GPR; NYSE American: GPL) (\"Great Panther\"; the \"Company\") announces production results for the first quarter (\"Q1\") 2018 from its two wholly-owned Mexican silver mining operations: the Guanajuato Mine Complex (\"GMC\"), which includes the San Ignacio Mine, and the Topia Mine in Durango.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Production Highlights (Compared to First Quarter 2017 1 )\nConsolidated metal production increased 42% to 1,031,937 silver equivalent ounces (\"Ag eq oz\") Silver production increased 35% to 491,063 silver ounces (\"Ag oz\") Gold production increased 13% to 5,831 gold ounces (\"Au oz\") Ore processed increased 17% to 96,869 tonnes milled\n\"Great Panther's first quarter production improved significantly compared to the first quarter last year when the Topia plant was suspended for planned upgrades\", stated James Bannantine, President & CEO. \"To date in 2018, our Mexican operations are performing steadily, with production in line with annual guidance, and we are continuing to make progress on the technical evaluation of the Coricancha Mine in Peru.\"\nConsolidated Operations Summary\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\nChange\nQ1 2018\nQ4 2017\nChange\nOre processed (tonnes milled)\n96,869\n82,456\n17%\n96,869\n98,396\n-2%\nSilver equivalent ounce production 2\n1,031,937\n727,372\n42%\n1,031,937\n1,065,773\n-3%\nSilver ounce production\n491,063\n364,995\n35%\n491,063\n514,218\n-5%\nGold ounce production\n5,831\n5,177\n13%\n5,831\n5,931\n-2%\nLead production (tonnes)\n433\n-\nn/a\n433\n441\n-2%\nZinc production (tonnes)\n533\n-\nn/a\n533\n551\n-3%\n(1)\nThe Topia processing plant underwent upgrades in Q1 2017 and there was no processing during Q1 2017.\n(2)\nSilver equivalent ounces were calculated using a 70:1 Ag:Au ratio, and ratios of 1:0.0559 and 1:0.0676 for the price/ounce of silver to price/pound of lead and zinc, respectively.\nGuanajuato Mine Complex\nIn Q1 2018, total metal production for the GMC was 695,909 Ag eq oz, which represents a 4% decrease compared to both the fourth quarter (\"Q4\") 2017 and Q1 2017. The decrease was mainly attributed to lower tonnes milled and lower silver grades. The lower tonnes milled are in part a reflection of the higher proportion of harder ores from the San Ignacio mine, which reduced processing capacity. The lower average silver grade was due to the lower tonnage and grades mined from the Guanajuato mine, which has higher silver grades than the San Ignacio mine. In addition, the silver grades from the Guanajuato mine were affected by variability in the mineral resource. These factors were partly offset by improved gold grades and recoveries.\nGMC Operations Summary\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\nChange\nQ1 2018\nQ4 2017\nChange\nOre processed (tonnes milled)\n78,919\n82,456\n-4%\n78,919\n80,896\n-2%\nSilver equivalent ounce production 1\n695,909\n727,372\n-4%\n695,909\n724,643\n-4%\nSilver ounce production\n304,863\n364,995\n-16%\n304,863\n332,203\n-8%\nGold ounce production\n5,586\n5,177\n8%\n5,586\n5,606\n0%\nAg grade (g/t)\n135\n155\n-13%\n135\n144\n-6%\nAu grade (g/t)\n2.50\n2.30\n9%\n2.50\n2.48\n1%\nAg recovery (%)\n88.8%\n88.8%\n0%\n88.8%\n88.5%\n0%\nAu recovery (%)\n88.0%\n85.0%\n4%\n88.0%\n87.0%\n1%\n(1)\nSilver equivalent ounces were calculated using a 70:1 Ag:Au ratio.\nThe San Ignacio mine accounted for 65% of the total ore processed at the GMC in Q1 2018, compared to 57% in Q1 2017 and 62% in Q4 2017. The increase in tonnes milled from the San Ignacio mine and, to a lesser degree, higher gold grades from the Guanajuato mines, are the main contributors to the increased gold grades.\nQ1 2018 saw an increase in exploration development and underground drilling at the Guanajuato mine, aimed at increasing definition in the mineral resources mainly near and adjacent to areas currently being mined.\nTopia Mine\nTotal metal production during Q1 2018 from the Topia Mine was 336,027 Ag eq oz. There was no production from Topia during Q1 2017 due to the planned processing plant suspension for plant upgrades along with the installation of a dry tailings handling facility.\nCompared to Q4 2017, metal production was slightly lower, reflecting a decrease in gold grades due to variability in the ore and ground conditions, partially offset by higher mill throughput.\nTopia Operations Summary\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017 1\nChange\nQ1 2018\nQ4 2017\nChange\nOre processed (tonnes milled)\n17,950\n-\nn/a\n17,950\n17,500\n3%\nSilver equivalent ounce production 2\n336,027\n-\nn/a\n336,027\n341,129\n-1%\nSilver ounce production\n186,201\n-\nn/a\n186,201\n182,015\n2%\nGold ounce production\n244\n-\nn/a\n244\n325\n-25%\nLead production (tonnes)\n433\n-\nn/a\n433\n441\n-2%\nZinc production (tonnes)\n533\n-\nn/a\n533\n551\n-3%\nAg grade (g/t)\n348\n-\nn/a\n348\n352\n-1%\nAu grade (g/t)\n0.74\n-\nn/a\n0.74\n0.95\n-22%\nAg recovery (%)\n92.7%\n-\nn/a\n92.7%\n91.8%\n1%\nAu recovery (%)\n57.1%\n-\nn/a\n57.1%\n60.8%\n-6%\n(1)\nThe Topia processing plant was suspended for upgrades in Q1 2017 and had no production during that period.\n(2)\nSilver equivalent ounces were calculated using a 70:1 Ag:Au ratio, and ratios of 1:0.0559 and 1:0.0676 for the price/ounce of silver to price/pound of lead and zinc, respectively.\nOUTLOOK\nThe Company is maintaining its 2018 guidance of 4.0 – 4.1 million Ag eq oz (at a 70:1 silver to gold ratio). There is also no change to 2018 guidance for cash cost per silver ounce (\"cash cost\") and all-in sustaining cost per payable silver ounce (\"AISC\") of US$5.00 – 6.50 and US$12.50 – 14.50, respectively. It is cautioned that cash cost and AISC are very sensitive to the Mexican peso foreign exchange rate and metal prices through the computation of by-product credits.\nThe focus for 2018 continues to be on maintaining steady and efficient operations in Mexico, while advancing the Company's Coricancha Mine in Peru to set a platform for production growth in 2019 and 2020. While still in the evaluation stage, based upon historic production records, Coricancha has the potential to add 3 million Ag eq oz of annual production. The Company expects to make announcements on the progress of evaluation and technical studies for Coricancha later this quarter.\nIn addition, the Company continues to seek and evaluate additional acquisition opportunities to meet the Company's growth objectives.\nThe technical information contained in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Matthew Wunder, P. Geo., Vice President Exploration for the Company and the Qualified Person for the Guanajuato Mine Complex, the Topia Mine and the Coricancha Mine under the meaning of NI 43-101. Aspects relating to mining and metallurgy are overseen by Ali Soltani, Chief Operating Officer for Great Panther.\nRELEASE OF FIRST QUARTER 2018 FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CONFERENCE CALL\nThe Company has scheduled the release of its first quarter 2018 financial results for Wednesday, May 2, 2018 after market close.\nA conference call and webcast will be held on Thursday, May 3, 2018 at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time (11:00 a.m. Pacific Time) to discuss the results.
