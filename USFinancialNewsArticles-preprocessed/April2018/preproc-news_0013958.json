    "text": "IRVINE, Calif., Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV , Inc., announced today that its board of directors has approved an estimated per share net asset value (\"NAV\") of its Class T and Class I common stock of $9.65 as of Dec. 31, 2017.\n\"We are very pleased with this initial valuation of our portfolio, which is based on aggregate portfolio growth of approximately 11.3 percent in the value of our properties compared to the aggregate contract purchase price,\" said Jeff Hanson, chairman and CEO of Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV. \"We acquired our first property less than two years ago, and have since built a portfolio of healthcare real estate which is performing very well, as our financial reports and this valuation demonstrate.\"\nCBRE Capital Advisors, Inc. (\"CBRE Cap\"), an independent FINRA-registered broker-dealer firm that specializes in providing real estate and financial services, was engaged by the company's audit committee, comprised solely of independent directors, to conduct a valuation of the company's assets and liabilities. Upon the audit committee's receipt and review of CBRE Cap's valuation report, meeting with representatives from CBRE Cap and consideration of the material assumptions and valuation methodologies applied and described therein, the audit committee recommended to the board of directors that it adopt $9.65 as the estimated per share NAV of the company's Class T and Class I common stock, which represents the mid-point of the range determined by CBRE Cap in its valuation report. The valuation was performed in accordance with the methodology provided in the Investment Program Association's practice guideline regarding valuations of publicly registered non-listed REITs (\"IPA guidelines\").\nConsistent with the IPA guidelines, CBRE Cap's valuation does not include a portfolio premium that may accrue in a typical real estate transaction, nor does it reflect an enterprise value. The board of directors is ultimately and solely responsible for the establishment of the estimated per share NAV.\nAbout Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV, Inc.\nGriffin-American Healthcare REIT IV intends to build a balanced and diversified portfolio of healthcare real estate assets, focusing primarily on medical office buildings, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, senior housing and other healthcare-related facilities. Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV also seeks to provide: portfolio diversification, preservation of capital, monthly distributions and capital appreciation by increasing the value of its properties for its stockholders. Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV qualified to be taxed as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes beginning with its taxable year ended December 31, 2016, and it intends to continue to qualify to be taxed as a REIT.
