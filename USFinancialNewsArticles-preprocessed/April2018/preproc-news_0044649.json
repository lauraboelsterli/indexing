    "text": "Leading Provider of Electric Vehicle Charging Equipment and Networked Charging Services\nDoubles Year Over Year Gross Profits\nHollywood, Florida, Blink Charging Co . (NASDAQ: BLNK, BLNKW) (“Blink Charging” or the “Company”) announced financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, demonstrating what the company believes is a growth trajectory beyond its anticipated plan.\n2017 Highlights* Include:\nGross Profit increased 104% from $512,000 in 2016 to $1 million in 2017. Charging service revenue from Company-owned charging stations increased 4% from $1.14 million in 2016 to $1.18 million in 2017. Total assets increased 41% from $1.9 million in 2016 to $2.7 million in 2017\n“While these numbers do not reflect our recapitalization, our progress in 2017 allowed us to tee the Company up for the next stage, leading to our $18.5 million public offering on Nasdaq this past February,” said Mike Calise, Blink Charging’s Chief Executive Officer. “We are spearheading strategic nationwide growth of EV charging locations so that millions of EV drivers and property owners throughout the U.S. can take part in what is quickly becoming a revolution in transportation. We believe our technology investment is removing the biggest barrier to mass EV adoption, the lack of availability of EV charging locations, and we believe that should drive an increase in EV charging equipment sales and charging service revenues going forward.”\nAbout Blink Charging Co . :\nBlink Charging (NASDAQ: BLNK, BLNKW) is one of the leaders in nationwide public electric vehicle (EV) charging equipment and services, enabling EV drivers to easily charge at locations throughout the United States.
