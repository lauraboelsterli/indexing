    "text": "0 COMMENTS Flir Systems Inc. presented its thermal drone and imaging technology at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January. Photo: Craig Durling/Zuma Press\nFlir Systems Inc. agreed to pay $30 million to settle U.S. allegations it violated laws restricting military-related exports, though the settlement only requires the company to pay half that amount.\nThe Wilsonville, Ore.-based defense contractor reached a four-year consent agreement with the U.S. State Department. The settlement follows a review of Flir Systems’ compliance policies by the department’s Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance. The deal was struck Tuesday; the State Department announced it a day later.\nFlir makes infrared technology for use in binoculars and other sensing products and systems. It violated the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations by transferring defense items to dual-national employees in a number of countries where the U.S. restricts exports of such items, the State Department alleged. The countries cited included Iran, Iraq, Lebanon and Cuba.\nThe company committed a total of 347 violations , according to a proposed charging letter. The total penalty is $30 million but the department said it suspended payment of half of the amount on the condition the funds will be used for department-approved remedial compliance measures.\nFlir is required under the agreement to hire an external official to oversee the settlement, the implementation of the compliance enhancements and two audits assessing the company’s policies and procedures.\n“We accept responsibility for our actions leading to these penalties,” said James Cannon, the company’s CEO, in an emailed statement, adding the company remains “fully committed to complying with U.S. export controls laws” and is working with the U.S. government to achieve its policy objectives.\nFlir set aside $15 million in the first quarter for the expected penalty, it said Wednesday in an earnings statement .\nThe State Department said it chose not to debar the company because it voluntarily disclosed the alleged violations, acknowledged their serious nature, cooperated with the review and implemented a number of improvements to the compliance program during the review.\n“The settlement demonstrates the Department’s role in strengthening U.S. industry by protecting U.S. defense articles, including technical data, from unauthorized export through the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs’ Directorate of Defense Trade Controls,” the State Department said.\nWrite to Samuel Rubenfeld at Samuel.Rubenfeld@wsj.com.
