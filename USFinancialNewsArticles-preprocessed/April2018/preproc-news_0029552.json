    "text": "1 COMMENTS The U.S. Treasury passed up a formal opportunity to designate China a currency manipulator, though it faulted Beijing for doing too little to open its economy and retained China on a formal monitoring list for possibly receiving the designation in the future.\n“The increasingly non-market direction of China’s economic development poses growing risks to its major trading partners and the long-term global growth outlook,” the department said of China in its semiannual report on international exchange rates. “Treasury is strongly concerned by the lack of progress by China in correcting the bilateral trade imbalance.”\nThe Treasury Department’s report, released Friday, is the document in which Washington can formally designate nations as currency manipulators, a step that President Donald Trump had repeatedly vowed to take toward China when he was a candidate.\nLabeling China as a manipulator would have instantly deepened the trade dispute between Beijing and Washington by formally triggering negotiations over Chinese currency practices, adding to tensions that are already thick from multiple rounds of tariffs that have been announced by both sides.\nBoth the currency report and the nations’ trade discussions have focused on the extent of China’s large trade surplus with the U.S.—by far the largest in the world with the U.S. importing $375 billion more in goods than it exported to China over the past year. The nation with the second largest trade surplus over this period was Mexico with $71 billion.\nThis is now the third of the semiannual reports in which the Trump administration has declined to apply the manipulator designation to Beijing. The reason for restraint is that China hasn’t intervened significantly in its currency markets in recent quarters, one of the key criteria in the report for meeting the threshold of manipulation.\nChina remains on the formal monitoring list, which the Treasury uses to place countries on notice that their currency and other economic policies have put the U.S. at unfair disadvantage and that they could be close to triggering sanctions. In the case of China, direct intervention in its currency market, if large enough, could earn it the manipulator designation.\nDesignation as a currency manipulator would formally launch a negotiating process over China’s currency and allow the Treasury to being pursuing a process to “impose meaningful penalties.” The penalties aren’t spelled out, but the designation could be cited to justify further tariffs and investment restrictions.\n“Treasury estimates that Chinese authorities significantly curtailed intervention in the second half of 2017 that they had been undertaking to support the value” of the yuan, the report said.\nFor the first time, the U.S. added India to the monitoring list, due to extensive intervention in its currency markets, with purchases that exceeded 2% of the country’s gross domestic product. Four countries remained on the list from before: Japan, South Korea, Germany and Switzerland.\nThe case of India is an unusual one and unlikely to lead to further action.\nSanctions can be triggered if countries on the monitoring list meet three criteria: persistently intervening in currency markets, running a significant trade surplus with the U.S. and running a large current-account surplus overall. No country currently meets all three criteria.\nIndia has a large trade surplus with the U.S. and was criticized for its currency interventions. With all its trading partners in total, however, India is a nation with a significant and widening trade deficit, rather than surplus, and remains very far away from reaching all three criteria that would trigger a further response.\nGermany, Japan and South Korea have large trade surpluses with the U.S. and large overall current-account surpluses, but didn’t intervene in their currency markets at significant scale. Switzerland has a large overall current-account surplus and did intervene in currency markets, but it doesn’t have a large trade surplus with the U.S.\nWrite to Josh Zumbrun at Josh.Zumbrun@wsj.com",
