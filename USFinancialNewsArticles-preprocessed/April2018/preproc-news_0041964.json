    "text": "EditorsNote: adds “since 2010” in second graf\nRyan LaMarre lined a single to center field to score Eddie Rosario with no outs in the bottom of the 16th inning Wednesday night, giving the Minnesota Twins a 2-1 victory over the Cleveland Indians and a split in their two-game series in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\nThe first Major League Baseball series in Puerto Rico since 2010 was dominated by pitching, with the Indians’ Corey Kluber silencing the Twins in a 6-1 win Tuesday before Cleveland’s Carlos Carrasco and Minnesota’s Jose Berrios each threw seven shutout innings Wednesday.\nThe series finale ended on a bit of a powerful note, with the Indians’ Edwin Encarnacion and Twins’ Miguel Sano exchanging solo home runs in the 14th, setting the stage for LaMarre’s heroics two innings later.\nFacing right-hander Josh Tomlin, who was making his first relief appearance since 2016, Rosario led off the 16th with a single.\nLogan Morrison then hit a blooper into right field, and when the Indians went for a force out on Rosario at second base, the throw got away, allowing Rosario to get to third.\nAfter Eduardo Escobar was walked to load the bases, LaMarre, who didn’t start the game but still finished with three hits, smacked Tomlin’s two-strike pitch into center field, ending the marathon.\nAlan Busenitz (1-0), making his second appearance of the season, was credited with his second major-league win after pitching two scoreless innings with three strikeouts.\nTomlin (0-2) took the loss. The run charged to him was unearned.\nSix Twins pitchers, beginning with Berrios, matched Carrasco and his mates for 13 innings before Encarnacion connected on a full-count pitch by Trevor Hildenberger with one out in the 14th and sent his fourth homer of the season over the fence in left field.\nBut Sano launched Matt Belisle’s first pitch of the bottom of the 14th in the same direction, drawing the Twins back to even at 1-1. It was Sano’s fourth homer of the year as well.\nBoth allowing three hits. Carrasco walked one and struck out seven. He was coming off a complete-game, three-hit effort in a 5-1 win over Detroit last Wednesday.\nBerrios’ seven shutout innings extended his streak to 14. He struck out five and did not walk a batter for the second straight game.\nJoe Mauer, Rosario and Escobar added two hits apiece for the Twins, who have won four of five bridging three rainouts last week.\nMichael Brantley and Encarnacion had two hits each for the Indians, who were out-hit 13-12.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
