    "text": "Oil prices were higher on Friday, heading for their largest weekly gain in more than a year after U.S. President Donald Trump's comments about possible military action in Syria and reports of dwindling global oil stocks.\nBrent crude was up 75 cents, or 1 percent, at $72.77 a barrel by 2:10 p.m. ET and set for a weekly gain of more than 8 percent, it strongest performance since July 2017.\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery rose 49 cents to $67.56, up nearly 9 percent for the week and on pace for its best weekly performance since December 2016. The contract earlier touched its highest intraday level since Dec. 4, 2014.\nTraders sought to lock in long crude positions — or bets that prices will continue to rise — ahead of the weekend, said John Kilduff, Partner at hedge fund Again Capital Management.\n\"The geopolitical jitters just keep getting priced in here more and more, as we get closer to the moment of the strikes, if there are any,\" Kilduff said, noting Syria posed a risk to global stability because of its relationship with other powerful oil producers.\nshow chapters Expect US oil production to go onwards and upwards in 2018: IEA 9 Hours Ago | 03:53 \"Syria is a client state of both Russia and Iran and the risk for escalation is quite high and I think that is what the market is worried about.\"\nBoth oil benchmarks hit their highest since late 2014 on Wednesday after Trump warned that missiles \"will be coming\" in response to a suspected gas attack in Syria and after Saudi Arabia said it intercepted missiles over Riyadh.\nTrump tweeted on Thursday that an attack on Syria \"could be very soon or not so soon at all\", raising the prospect that an attack might not be as imminent as he seemed to suggest the previous day.\n\"The Syrian escalation risk cannot be fully written off, but we view that it deserves less of a premium than three days ago,\" Petromatrix said in a note.\nA global oil stocks surplus is close to evaporating, OPEC said on Thursday, adding that its collective output fell to 31.96 million barrels per day (bpd) in March, down 201,000 bpd from February.\nVienna-based OPEC and its oil producer allies are poised to extend their supply reduction pact into 2019 even as the global glut of crude looks set to be eradicated by September, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo told Reuters.\nshow chapters What you see is a shift in the oil market, says energy expert 10 Hours Ago | 02:57 The International Energy Agency (IEA), which coordinates the energy policies of industrialized nations, signaled on Friday that markets could become too tight if supply remains restrained.\n\"It is not for us to declare on behalf of the Vienna agreement countries that it is 'mission accomplished', but if our outlook is accurate, it certainly looks very much like it,\" the IEA said.\nMeanwhile China's March crude oil imports climbed month on month to the second-highest level on record.\nU.S. drillers added seven oil rigs in the week to April 13, bringing the total count to 815, the highest since March 2015, General Electric Co's Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday.\n— CNBC's Tom DiChristopher contributed to this report.",
