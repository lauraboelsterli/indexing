    "text": "April 12, 2018 / 6:28 AM / Updated 28 minutes ago London-listed miner CAML reports 35 percent jump in core earnings Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - Base metals miner Central Asia Metals (CAML) ( CAML.L ) reported a 35 percent rise in 2017 core earnings as copper prices improved, allowing it to raise its dividend. \nThe London-listed miner said earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBIDTA) in 2017 reached $53.8 million (Â£37.9 million), up from $39.9 million a year ago. \nThe miner bought the SASA mine in Macedonia in September for $402.5 million, which was funded through a combination of debt and equity. \nCAML, which mines mainly copper, zinc and lead, reported that net debt jumped to $138.9 million from no debt and net cash of $40.3 million last year. \nCAML proposed a final dividend of 10 pence, taking 2017 total payout to 16.5 cents from 15.5 cents a year ago.
