    "text": "Dillon Peters pitched six scoreless innings and fellow rookie Brian Anderson stroked a three-run double to lead the Miami Marlins to a 6-0 win over the visiting Chicago Cubs on Sunday afternoon.\nThe Cubs and Marlins split their season-opening, four-game series at Marlins Park. The Cubs, considered to be World Series contenders, had to leave disappointed they couldn’t do better against a young Marlins team that is rebuilding after an offseason purge of established stars such as Giancarlo Stanton, Marcell Ozuna, Christian Yelich and Dee Gordon.\nPeters (1-0) won just his second major-league game in his seventh start and fourth decision. He allowed six hits and one walk, striking out two.\nIt was a surprisingly successful performance by Peters, who had been sent to the Marlins’ minor-league camp earlier this spring. But after an injury to starter Dan Straily, Peters was brought back, setting the stage for Sunday’s gem.\nThe Marlins got relief help from Drew Steckenrider, Tayron Guerrero and Kyle Barraclough, each of whom pitched a scoreless inning.\nKyle Schwarber and Addison Russell hit doubles for the Cubs but both were stranded. The Cubs’ other six hits were singles. Schwarber, who went 2-for-4, was the only Cubs player who had more than one hit.\nThree Cubs players with South Florida ties - Anthony Rizzo, Albert Almora and Victor Caratini — struggled again on Sunday. All three left Miami with batting averages below .175.\nChicago starter Jose Quintana (0-1) allowed six hits, four walks and six runs in six innings.\nMiami broke open a scoreless game with a five-run fifth. Cameron Maybin started the rally with a leadoff double, and he scored when catcher Chad Wallach - who went 0-for-10 with eight strikeouts in the first two games of the series - hit an opposite-field RBI single.\nThe rest of the inning was highlighted by an opposite-field RBI single by Derek Dietrich and Anderson’s two-out, bases-clearing double that rolled to the fence in right-center.\nThe Marlins extended their lead to 6-0 in the sixth when Yadiel Rivera hit a two-run single and scored on Wallach’s double.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
