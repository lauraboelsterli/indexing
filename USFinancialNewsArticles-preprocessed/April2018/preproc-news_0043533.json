    "text": "TORONTO, April 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DREAM HARD ASSET ALTERNATIVES TRUST (TSX:DRA.UN) (“Dream Alternatives”, the “Trust” or “our”) today announced that, in connection with its previously announced normal course issuer bid (the “Bid” ), which commenced on January 15, 2018, Dream Alternatives has entered into an automatic securities repurchase plan (the “Plan” ) with its designated broker in order to facilitate purchases of its Units under the Bid.\nThe Plan allows for purchases by Dream Alternatives of Units at any time including, without limitation, when the Trust would ordinarily not be permitted to make purchases due to regulatory restrictions or self-imposed blackout periods. Purchases will be made by Dream Alternatives' broker based upon the parameters prescribed by the Toronto Stock Exchange (the “TSX” ) and the terms of the parties' written agreement. Outside of such restricted or black-out periods, the Units may also be purchased in accordance with management’s discretion. The Plan will terminate on January 14, 2019.\nAbout Dream Alternatives\nDream Alternatives provides an opportunity for unitholders to invest in hard asset alternative investments, real estate development, real estate lending, real estate, and renewable power managed by an experienced team with a successful track record in these areas. The objectives of the Trust are to build and maintain a growth-oriented portfolio, provide predictable cash distributions to unitholders on a tax efficient basis, and grow and reposition the portfolio to increase net asset value (NAV) per unit over time.
