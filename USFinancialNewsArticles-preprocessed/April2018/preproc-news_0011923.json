    "text": "Detroit center fielder Leonys Martin and third baseman Jeimer Candelario had RBIs in the 10th inning and the Tigers scored five runs in their last two at-bats to spoil the Chicago White Sox’ home opener 9-7 at wintry Guaranteed Rate Field on Thursday afternoon.\nNiko Goodrum hit a two-run homer with two outs in the ninth inning and Victor Martinez doubled in Nicholas Castellanos to cap a three-run rally that tied the game at 7 off White Sox closer Joakim Soria. Goodrum’s homer was the first of his career.\nMikie Mahtook singled to open the 10th inning off Gregory Infante (0-1) before Jose Iglesias walked. Mahtook took third on Dixon Machado’s groundout and scored on Martin’s grounder to second base for an 8-7 lead, the Tigers’ first of the game.\nIglesias was ruled safe at second base when Sox shortstop Tim Anderson took his foot of the bag while attempting to force Iglesias and Candelario followed with a single for a 9-7 lead. The Tigers had 17 hits.\nYolmer Sanchez had three hits and three RBIs and Matt Davidson had two hits and scored four runs for the White Sox (3-3) in a game played through snow flurries and temperatures in the mid-30s.\nShane Greene struck out the side in the 10th inning for his first save of the season. He got the first two out quickly, then Omar Narvaez walked with two outs and pinch-hitter Nicky Delmonico was hit by a pitch before Greene fanned Yoan Moncada. Joe Jimenez (1-0) retired all three he faced in the ninth.\nMartinez had three hits and two RBIs and Castellanos had three hits and scored two runs for the Tigers (2-4). Martin had two hits and two RBIs and Machado had two hits, both doubles, and an RBI.\nWhite Sox right-hander James Shields gave up three runs and eight hits in five innings and would have been 2-0 after two starts for the first time in his 13-year major league career before the Tigers rallied in the ninth inning. Shields struck out one and walked one.\nTigers right-hander Jordan Zimmerman (0-1) gave up six runs and nine hits in 4 1/3 innings. He struck out three and walked one.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
