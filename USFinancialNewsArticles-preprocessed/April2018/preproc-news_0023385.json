    "text": "LONDON, April 10 (Reuters) - A unit of Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox said it was cooperating with an inspection by the European Commission after the Telegraph newspaper reported that officials had raided its offices in London.\n“Fox Networks Group (FNG) is cooperating fully with the EC inspection,” a spokesman said. FNG is an operating unit of Fox, which distributes TV and cable channels and content around the world.\nThe Telegraph reported earlier on Tuesday that the competition watchdog had raided Fox offices in London to seize documents and company records.\nIt said the precise nature of the confidential investigation, which is believed to be in its early stages, was unclear.
