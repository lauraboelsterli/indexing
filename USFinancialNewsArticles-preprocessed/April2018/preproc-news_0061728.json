    "text": "April 30, 2018 / 5:36 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Netanyahu - Iran lied about not pursuing nuclear weapons Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nTEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that Iran had lied about not pursuing nuclear weapons and had continued to preserve and expand its nuclear weapons knowledge after signing a 2015 deal with global powers. Israeli Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks during a news conference at the Ministry of Defence in Tel Aviv, Israel April 30, 2018. REUTERS/ Amir Cohen\n“Iran’s leaders repeatedly deny ever pursuing nuclear weapons,” said Netanyahu. “Tonight I’m here to tell you one thing: Iran lied.”\n“After signing the nuclear deal in 2015, Iran intensified its efforts to hide its secret files,” he said. “In 2017 Iran moved its nuclear weapons files to a highly secret location in Tehran.”\nNetanyahu said that Iran continued to preserve and expand its nuclear weapons knowledge for future use.
