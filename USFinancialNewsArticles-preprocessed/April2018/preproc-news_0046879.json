    "text": " Amgen Inc on Tuesday reported a higher first quarter profit, driven by lower taxes and a 3 percent increase in product sales as strong growth for newer drugs like cholesterol medication Repatha offset weakness in older products.\nThe biotech company slightly raised the lower end of its full-year financial outlook, and said its adjusted tax rate would be 13.5 percent to 14.5 percent, or half a point less than previously expected.\nAmgen posted first quarter adjusted earnings of $3.47 per share, helped by lower taxes and fewer outstanding shares. Analysts on average expected $3.23 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nFirst-quarter revenue rose 2 percent to $5.55 billion, with sales up 3 percent to $5.34 billion.\nSales of anti-inflammatory drug Enbrel, faced with more competition in the rheumatology and dermatology sectors, fell 6 percent to $1.05 billion, below Wall Street estimates of $1.09 billion. Sales of Repatha more than doubled to $123 million, beating the average analyst estimate of $104 million.\nFor the full year, Amgen said it now expects adjusted EPS of $12.80 to $13.70, compared with $12.60 to $13.70 previously. It raised the lower end of 2018 revenue guidance to $21.9 billion from $21.8 billion and left the upper end unchanged at $22.8 billion. (Reporting by Deena Beasley; Editing by Sandra Maler)\n ",
