    "text": "LAS VEGAS, April 18, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Trustifi announced today the addition of Neville Pokroy, MD, a prominent Las Vegas doctor, specializing in nephrology, to its board of directors.\n“Dr. Pokroy brings more than 41 years of experience in the medical field. That industry holds massive amounts of private data and is extremely vulnerable to email security breaches and phishing,” said Idan Udi Edry, CEO of Trustifi. “Having such a distinguished veteran choose to be on our board shows not only his recognition of our technology’s application in the industry but also his belief in the success of the company.”\nDr. Pokroy has held academic appointments in South Africa, Israel, the UK and the US. He currently has a medical practice in Critical Care and Nephrology and is Medical Director of Davita Dialysis in Las Vegas. He is also on the Medical Executive Committee for Summerlin Hospital.\n“I am honored to be a part of this board,” said Dr. Pokroy. “Keeping patient information private and protected is part of our duty as caregivers. Trustifi’s technology can easily be applied in the medical industry, from clinics and hospitals, to private practices, clinical trials, and pharmaceuticals.\"\nLast month, Trustifii nationally launched its secure email platform, including a highly sought-after feature, Trustifi Postmarked Email®, which acts as a federally approved digital substitute to the U.S. Postal Service’s (USPS) certified mail. In addition to date/time and geo-based location tracking, the service offers several unique feature sets including encryption, two-factor authentication, and real-time “sensitive content review” of an email being drafted. It alerts the sender of any content (including the file names of attachments) with potentially sensitive data a user may want to examine before sending. Unlike most email encryption platforms, Trustifi Postmarked Email® is “certified” and can be used in legal proceedings or court as evidence.\nBy using Trustifi, both organizations and consumers can easily send time-sensitive, confidential data via an encrypted email to a recipient (who does not have to have the service), for just pennies, and be alerted when it has been opened and read, by whom, where, and if the email was forwarded or printed. The encryption also continues throughout the forwarding and replies to the email. The secure feature includes two-factor authentication to assist with data loss prevention by confirming the correct recipient of the outgoing email. The platform includes free plugins for Google Chrome and Microsoft Outlook.

Its patented, SaaS-based Trustifi Postmarked Email® service is a federally-accepted method of sending legal documents online. Headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada, and funded by venture capital firm Redhills Ventures, Trustifi’s founders have deep experience in cryptography, non-repudiation, and cybersecurity. They are focused on what they do best: secure communications.\nThe service is used by enterprises, small businesses, and consumers who want to ensure confidentiality and security in the delivery of their emails when they contain sensitive information.
