    "text": "  3:43 p.m. ET Share \nSurprise decision comes as country shows record economic growth Reuters \nBy David Gauthier-Villars \nTurkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday called an election more than a year early, a gambit that could help him secure a new term while the nation is still clocking record economic growth. \nObtaining a fresh mandate would allow Erdogan to take on vastly expanded presidential powers that voters narrowly approved in a constitutional referendum last year and that come into force after the election. \nThe decision came as a surprise because Erdogan, who has dominated the country’s political scene for more than a decade, has so far said he had no plan to bring forward the presidential and legislative votes, which were due to be held in November 2019. \n“We have decided to hold elections on June 24,” Erdogan said in a televised address from the presidential palace in Ankara after meeting with a political ally. “The Supreme Election Board will start preparation immediately.”",
