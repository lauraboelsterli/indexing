The securities offered by the Company consist of Units, at a price to the public of $1,000 per Unit, consisting of one share of the Company’s Series 4 Convertible Preferred Stock, each convertible into approximately 2,174 shares of common stock at a conversion price of $0.46 and a warrant to purchase 2,174 shares of common stock. The warrants will have an exercise price of $0.67 (subject to adjustment to the exercise price and the number of warrant shares in the event of recapitalization events, stock dividends, stock splits, stock combinations, dilutive issuances, reclassifications, reorganizations, or similar events), will be exercisable upon issuance and will expire five years from the date of issuance.
