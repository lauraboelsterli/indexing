New York improved to 7-1 while Washington (4-5) dropped its fifth game in a row.\nPinch hitter Juan Lagares singled to start the 12th and later scored when Cespedes lined a single to center off of Brandon Kintzler (0-2).\nSeth Lugo (1-0) got the win for New York thanks to three innings of scoreless relief. Jacob Rhame came on in bottom of the 12th and earned his first save this season.\nBoth starters lasted five innings and left with a no-decision. New York’s Matt Harvey gave up four runs while Washington starter Tanner Roark allowed five runs, all of which came on two homers.\nBryce Harper gave Washington a 2-0 lead in the first inning with a two-run homer off Harvey. Harper now has six homers already this season, which leads the major leagues.\nAdrian Gonzalez then gave the Mets a 4-2 lead with a grand slam to right in the top of the third inning. It was his first home run this season.\nThe Mets hit a grand slam for the second time in three games, as Jay Bruce got one that broke open New York’s Thursday victory over Washington.\nPedro Severino cut the Nationals’ deficit to 4-3 with his RBI double in the fourth.\nAsdrubal Cabrera homered in the fifth to put the Mets on top 5-3. However, Washington answered right back when Trea Turner lined an RBI single to left, slicing the New York lead to 5-4.\nThe Nationals tied the game on a Michael A. Taylor RBI single in the seventh inning.\nHarper led off the ninth with a walk as Washington loaded the bases with one out, but Lugo struck out the next two batters to force extra innings.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
