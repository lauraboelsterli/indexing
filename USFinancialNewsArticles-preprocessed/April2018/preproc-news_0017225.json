As the name implies, this mindset allows you to focus on others to help them feel more confident, while also boosting your own happiness.\n\"Having a mission to your work that incorporates a purpose bigger than yourself is such fast track to enjoying life more,\" Jamie noted.\nHere are the three ways Branson recommended adopting an \"others\" mindset in your daily life.\nCreate time during your busy day Most full-time employees work about 8.6 hours, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics . That means we spend about half of our waking hours at work, not including our commute time. Branson underscored the value of making time for others.\n\"The day can often slip by in a hurried blur so it's important to set aside time for the most important people in your life,\" he said.\nInstead, make an effort to take a walk during your lunch break, make it to a family dinner \"or even [making] a FaceTime call can really make a difference,\" Branson added.\nBe a good listener \"When spending time with the people who are most important to you, make them feel important and valued by listening,\" Branson said.\nBeing a good listener is actually a top skill that great leaders and managers share , according to former Google career coach Jenny Blake.\nshow chapters Give up these 7 toxic habits to be successful in business      10:17 AM ET Mon, 23 Jan 2017 | 01:04 \"When someone is talking to you, don't just sit there waiting to answer and to tell them all about how this relates to you,\" Branson said. \"Have empathy and think about what they are going through and really listen to what they have to say.\nFundamentally, Branson noted, the conversation \"isn't about you, it's about them.\"\nMake someone's day After completing the previous two steps, Branson said you will be more informed on what is going on with other people.\n\"Once you've got an insight into what's going on in someone's life, think about what you could do to make someone feel better or make them smile,\" he said.\nThe last step is to think of what you might be able to do to \"lighten someone's workload or make their life a little easier.\"\n\"Shifting to this mindset requires small change that could make a huge difference,\" Branson said.\nLike this story?
