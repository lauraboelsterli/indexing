    "text": "TORONTO, April 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gran Colombia Gold Corp. (TSX:GCM) announced today that it produced a total 18,633 ounces of gold in March bringing the total for the first quarter of 2018 to 52,672 ounces, up 35% compared to the first quarter of 2017. This brings the Company’s trailing 12-months’ total gold production to 187,485 ounces, up 8% from 2017’s annual production of 173,821 ounces and within the Company’s production guidance for 2018 of between 182,000 and 193,000 ounces.\nAt its high-grade Segovia Operations, gold production in March amounted to 16,611 ounces, bringing the total for the first quarter of 2018 to 46,472 ounces, up 42% compared to the first quarter of 2017. This brings the Company’s trailing 12-months’ total gold production from Segovia to 162,363 ounces, up 9% from 2017 fuelled by continuing growth in the Company mines which represented 94% of the trailing 12-months’ production. The Company processed an average of 931 tonnes per day (“tpd”) in the first quarter of 2018 with an overall average head grade of 16.1 g/t, an improvement from 881 tpd at 12.6 g/t in the first quarter of 2017. The Company continues to expect Segovia’s annual gold production for 2018 will range between 158,000 and 167,000 ounces.\nThe Company’s Marmato mine remained steady, producing 2,022 ounces of gold in March, bringing the total for the first quarter of 2018 to 6,200 ounces compared with 6,240 ounces in the first quarter of 2017. This brings the trailing 12-months’ total gold production at the end of March to 25,122 ounces, on par with 2017’s annual production and within the Company’s guidance range for 2018 of between 24,000 and 26,000 ounces.\nThe Company will be releasing its financial results for the first quarter of 2018 on or about May 10, 2018.\nAbout Gran Colombia Gold Corp.\nGran Colombia is a Canadian-based gold and silver exploration, development and production company with its primary focus in Colombia.
