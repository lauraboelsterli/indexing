    "text": "ATLANTA, April 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc. (NYSE: APTS) (\"PAC\" or the \"Company\") today announced that it closed on an aggregate loan investment of up to approximately $30.1 million. This investment is in connection with the development of a 302-unit Class A multifamily community in Alexandria, Virginia. The property is conveniently located near the blue line transit station adjacent to the master-planned community known as Cameron Station. Additionally, with this investment, PAC received an option to purchase the multifamily community following stabilization at a discounted price to market.\n\"We continue to originate real estate loan investments that provide both attractive current returns and the opportunity to acquire new multifamily communities at a discount to stabilized value,\" said John A. Williams, the Company's Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Williams added, \"This is an exciting opportunity to originate a loan investment in a transit-oriented and affluent sub-market of Alexandria, Virginia.\"\nAbout Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc.\nPreferred Apartment Communities, Inc. is a Maryland corporation formed primarily to acquire and operate multifamily properties in select targeted markets throughout the United States.
