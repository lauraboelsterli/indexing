    "text": "The founders of Backpage.com and five others at the classified site have been indicted on federal charges in what authorities say was a scheme to facilitate prostitution by running ads for sexual services and hiding their revenues.\nAn indictment unsealed Monday alleges that Backpage.com on some occasions had helped customers edit their ads so they would stay within legal limits while still encouraging commercial sex.\nWebsite founders Michael Lacey and James Larkin are charged with facilitating prostitution and money laundering.\nAuthorities also have seized Backpage.com and its affiliated websites.\nThey are already facing state money laundering charges in California.\nLarry Kazan, who represents Lacey, didn't return a call seeking comment. There is no listing for Larkin's attorney.\nWATCH: Backpage.com CEO arrested on pimping charges in 2016 show chapters Backpage.com CEO arrested on pimping charges 10:46 AM ET Fri, 7 Oct 2016 | 00:40",
