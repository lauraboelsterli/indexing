The printer, announced on Thursday, has a rechargeable battery and uses ZINK Zero Ink technology, which means that ink cartridges are unnecessary. Courtesy of Canon \nThe printer, which costs $129.99 and comes with a pack of 10 sheets of photo paper, is available in rose gold, mint green, and slate gray. It is 4.7 × 3.2 × 0.7 inches and weighs 5.6 oz. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
