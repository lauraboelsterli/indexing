    "text": "LONDON, April 25 (Reuters) - The London metal exchange said on Wednesday it will analyse the implications of U.S. sanctions in relation to Rusalâ€™s metal after the Treasury gave customers of the aluminium producer more time to comply with sanctions.\nThe U.S. Treasury on Monday gave U.S consumers until Oct. 23 instead of June 5 to wind down business with Rusal. It said it would not impose secondary sanctions on non-U.S. entities engaged with Rusal or its subsidiaries.\nReporting by Pratima Desai and Maytaal Angel, editing by Louise Heavens\n ",
