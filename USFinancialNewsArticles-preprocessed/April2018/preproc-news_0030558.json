Its director of International Hotel Development for Europe Paul Rosenberg said the world’s largest hotel chain could also consider building hotels in other parts of Bulgaria. \n“We are looking at opportunities to develop the activity in Plovdiv, Varna, other places along the Black Sea coast and why not in the mountain resorts,” he said. \n“But there are no specific plans at the moment.” ($1 = 0.8083 euros) (Reporting by Angel Krasimirov Editing by Alexander Smith)",
