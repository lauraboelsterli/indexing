Excluding a favorable currency impact, at prevailing exchange rates, of approximately $0.16, the forecast range represents a projected increase of approximately 8% to 11% versus adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.72 in 2017 as detailed in the attached Schedule 2. This forecast assumes: Currency-neutral net revenue growth of approximately 8.0%; Operating cash flow of over $9.0 billion; Capital expenditures of approximately $1.7 billion; A full-year effective tax rate of approximately 26%; and No share repurchases. This forecast excludes the impact of any future acquisitions, unanticipated asset impairment and exit cost charges, future changes in currency exchange rates, further developments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and any unusual events. Factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to these projections.\n2018 FIRST-QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE: PM) today announced its 2018 first-quarter results.\n\"We began the year with strong, currency-neutral net revenue growth of more than 8% in the quarter, driven by higher volume for heated tobacco units and IQOS devices coupled with higher pricing from our combustible product portfolio,\" said André Calantzopoulos, Chief Executive Officer.\n\"Our increased full-year EPS guidance reflects the benefit of a lower effective tax rate and incorporates, at this early stage in the year, some caution regarding: on-going volume challenges in the GCC; the pricing environment in Russia; and less-rapid-than-initially-projected growth in sales of devices to consumers in Japan in the first quarter, as we are now reaching more conservative adult smoker segments that may require, at least at first, slightly more time for adoption. Even if this temporary dynamic in Japan persists, we remain on track to double our worldwide in-market sales of heated tobacco units compared to 2017.\"\n\"We are confident in our ability to deliver strong results this year and remain steadfast in our commitment to generously reward our shareholders.\"\nConference Call\nA conference call, hosted by Martin King, Chief Financial Officer, will be webcast at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on April 19, 2018. Access is at www.pmi.com/2018Q1earnings . The audio webcast may also be accessed on iOS or Android devices by downloading PMI’s free Investor Relations Mobile Application at www.pmi.com/irapp .\nImpact of U.S. Tax Reform\nPMI's 2018 full-year diluted earnings per share forecast assumes a full-year effective tax rate of approximately 26%. The reduction in this rate compared to the full-year effective tax rate of 28% communicated in February 2018 mainly reflects two factors:\nfurther analysis and interpretation of the scope and impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), primarily related to foreign tax credit limitations due to the Act's Global Intangible Low Taxed Income provisions; and revised foreign income tax estimates due to a change in the mix of our foreign earnings.\nThe Act has significant complexity, and our final full-year effective tax rate may differ from this assumption, due to, among other things, additional guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service, related interpretations and clarifications of tax law, and earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction.\nDividends\nDuring the quarter, PMI declared a regular quarterly dividend of $1.07, representing an annualized rate of $4.28 per common share.\nKey Terms, Definitions and Explanatory Notes\nGeneral\n\"PMI\" refers to Philip Morris International Inc. and its subsidiaries. Trademarks and service marks that are the registered property of, or licensed by, the subsidiaries of PMI, are italicized. Comparisons are made to the same prior-year period unless otherwise stated. Unless otherwise stated, references to total industry, total market, PMI shipment volume and PMI market share performance reflect cigarettes and heated tobacco units. [NEW] Key market data regarding total market size, PMI shipments and market share can be found in Appendix 1 provided with this press release. References to total international market, defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume excluding the United States, total industry, total market and market shares are PMI estimates for tax-paid products based on the latest available data from a number of internal and external sources and may, in defined instances, exclude the People's Republic of China and/or PMI's duty free business. \"OTP\" is defined as \"other tobacco products,\" primarily roll-your-own and make-your-own cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars and cigarillos, and does not include reduced-risk products. \"Combustible products\" is the term PMI uses to refer to cigarettes and OTP, combined. \"Total shipment volume\" is defined as the combined total of cigarette shipment volume and heated tobacco unit shipment volume. [NEW] Effective January 1, 2018, PMI began managing its business in six reporting segments as follows: the European Union Region (EU); the Eastern Europe Region (EE); the Middle East & Africa Region (ME&A), which includes PMI Duty Free; the South & Southeast Asia Region (S&SA); the East Asia & Australia Region (EA&A); and the Latin America & Canada Region (LA&C). \"North Africa\" is defined as Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia. [NEW] \"The GCC\" (Gulf Cooperation Council) is defined as Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\nFinancial\n[NEW] Net revenues related to combustible products refer to the operating revenues generated from the sale of these products, including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of sales and promotion incentives, and excise taxes. PMI recognizes revenue when control is transferred to the customer, typically either upon shipment or delivery of goods. [NEW] PMI has adopted Accounting Standard Update ASU 2014-09 \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" as of January 1, 2018 on a retrospective basis. PMI made an accounting policy election to exclude excise taxes collected from customers from the measurement of the transaction price, thereby presenting revenues, net of excise taxes in all periods. The underlying principles of the new standard, relating to the measurement of revenue and the timing of recognition, are closely aligned with PMI's current business model and practices. [NEW] PMI adopted Accounting Standard Update ASU 2017-07 \"Compensation - Retirement Benefits\" as of January 1, 2018 on a retrospective basis. Previously, total pension and other employee benefit costs were included in operating income. Beginning January 1, 2018, only the service cost component is required to be shown in operating income, while all other cost components are presented in a new line item “pension and other employee benefit costs\" below operating income. [NEW] Prior to 2018, management evaluated business segment performance, and allocated resources, based on operating companies income, or OCI. Effective January 1, 2018, management began evaluating business segment performance, and allocating resources, based on operating income, or OI. [NEW] \"Cost of sales\" consists principally of: tobacco leaf, non-tobacco raw materials, labor and manufacturing costs; shipping and handling costs; and the cost of IQOS devices produced by third-party electronics manufacturing service providers. Estimated costs associated with IQOS warranty programs are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized. [NEW] \"Marketing, administration and research costs\" include the costs of marketing and selling our products, other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products (including general corporate expenses), and costs incurred to develop new products. The most significant components of our marketing, administration and research costs are marketing and sales expenses and general and administrative expenses. [NEW] \"Cost/Other\" in the Financial Summary table of total PMI and the six reporting segments of this release reflects the currency-neutral variances of: cost of sales (excluding the volume/mix cost component); marketing, administration and research costs; asset impairment and exit costs; and amortization of intangibles. [NEW] \"Adjusted Operating Income Margin\" is calculated as adjusted operating income, divided by net revenues. [NEW] \"Adjusted EBITDA\" is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and equity (income)/loss in unconsolidated subsidiaries, excluding asset impairment and exit costs, and unusual items. \"Net debt\" is defined as total debt, less cash and cash equivalents. [NEW] Management reviews net revenues, OI, OI margins, operating cash flow and earnings per share, or \"EPS,\" on an adjusted basis, which may exclude the impact of currency and other items such as acquisitions, asset impairment and exit costs, tax items and other special items. Management reviews these measures because they exclude changes in currency exchange rates and other factors that may distort underlying business trends, thereby improving the comparability of PMI’s business performance between reporting periods. Furthermore, PMI uses several of these measures in its management compensation program to promote internal fairness and a disciplined assessment of performance against company targets. PMI discloses these measures to enable investors to view the business through the eyes of management. Non-GAAP measures used in this release should neither be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for the financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, see the relevant schedules provided with this press release.\nReduced-Risk Products\n\"Reduced-risk products,\" or \"RRPs,\" is the term PMI uses to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking. PMI has a range of RRPs in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization. Because PMI's RRPs do not burn tobacco, they produce an aerosol that contains far lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful constituents than found in cigarette smoke. [NEW] IQOS is a precisely controlled heating device into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol. \"Heated tobacco units,\" or \"HTUs,\" is the term PMI uses to refer to heated tobacco consumables, which include the company's HEETS, HEETS Marlboro and HEETS FROM MARLBORO, defined collectively as HEETS, as well as Marlboro HeatSticks and Parliament HeatSticks. [NEW] Net revenues related to RRPs represent the sale of heated tobacco units, IQOS devices and related accessories, and other nicotine-containing products, primarily e-vapor products, including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of sales and promotion incentives, and excise taxes. PMI recognizes revenue when control is transferred to the customer, typically either upon shipment or delivery of goods.\nSHIPMENT VOLUME\nPMI Shipment Volume by Region First-Quarter (million units) 2018 2017 Change Cigarettes European Union 39,671 42,540 (6.7 )% Eastern Europe 22,039 24,596 (10.4 )% Middle East & Africa 29,248 31,978 (8.5 )% South & Southeast Asia 40,218 37,899 6.1 % East Asia & Australia 14,091 17,243 (18.3 )% Latin America & Canada 19,013 19,296 (1.5 )% Total PMI 164,280 173,552 (5.3 )% Heated Tobacco Units European Union 928 184 +100% Eastern Europe 564 54 +100% Middle East & Africa 709 51 +100% South & Southeast Asia — — — % East Asia & Australia 7,342 4,145 77.1 % Latin America & Canada 23 1 +100% Total PMI 9,566 4,435 +100% Cigarettes and Heated Tobacco Units European Union 40,599 42,724 (5.0 )% Eastern Europe 22,603 24,650 (8.3 )% Middle East & Africa 29,957 32,029 (6.5 )% South & Southeast Asia 40,218 37,899 6.1 % East Asia & Australia 21,433 21,388 0.2 % Latin America & Canada 19,036 19,297 (1.4 )% Total PMI 173,846 177,987 (2.3 )% PMI's total shipment volume decreased by 2.3%, principally due to:\nthe EU, reflecting lower cigarette shipment volume mainly in France, Germany and Poland; Eastern Europe, reflecting lower cigarette shipment volume mainly in Russia and Ukraine; and Middle East & Africa, reflecting lower cigarette shipment volume mainly in the GCC, notably Saudi Arabia, and North Africa, notably Algeria, partly offset by higher cigarette shipment volume mainly in Turkey and PMI Duty Free;\npartly offset by\nSouth & Southeast Asia, reflecting higher cigarette shipment volume, driven mainly by Pakistan and Thailand, partly offset by Indonesia; and East Asia & Australia, reflecting higher heated tobacco unit shipment volume, driven by Japan and Korea.\nExcluding the net unfavorable impact of total estimated distributor inventory movements of approximately 2.1 billion units, driven mainly by Japan and Saudi Arabia, PMI's total shipment volume decreased by 1.1%.\nPMI shipment volume by brand is shown in the table below.\nPMI Shipment Volume by Brand First-Quarter (million units) 2018 2017 Change Cigarettes Marlboro 57,973 62,399 (7.1 )% L&M 19,225 21,913 (12.3 )% Chesterfield 13,875 11,544 20.2 % Philip Morris 10,659 10,608 0.5 % Sampoerna A 8,624 9,913 (13.0 )% Parliament 8,460 9,199 (8.0 )% Bond Street 6,975 8,485 (17.8 )% Dji Sam Soe 6,696 4,459 50.2 % Lark 5,517 6,526 (15.5 )% Fortune 3,583 2,882 24.3 % Others 22,693 25,624 (11.4 )% Total Cigarettes 164,280 173,552 (5.3 )% Heated Tobacco Units 9,566 4,435 +100.0% Total PMI 173,846 177,987 (2.3 )% Note: Sampoerna A includes Sampoerna.\nPMI's cigarette shipment volume of the following brands decreased:\nMarlboro, mainly due to Germany, Japan and Saudi Arabia, partly offset by Indonesia and Turkey; L&M, mainly due to Germany, North Africa, Russia and Saudi Arabia, partly offset by Thailand; Sampoerna A in Indonesia, partly reflecting the impact of its retail price increasing past its round pack price point in the fourth quarter of 2017; Parliament, mainly due to Japan, Russia and Saudi Arabia, partly offset by Turkey; Bond Street, mainly due to Russia and Ukraine; Lark, mainly due to Japan, partly offset by Turkey; and \"Others,\" mainly due to: mid-price brands, notably Sampoerna U in Indonesia, partly reflecting the impact of above-inflation retail price increases; and the successful portfolio consolidation of local, low-price brands into international trademarks, notably in Russia; partly offset by low-price brands in Pakistan.\nPMI's cigarette shipment volume of the following brands increased:\nChesterfield, mainly driven by Brazil, Colombia, Italy, Saudi Arabia and Turkey; Philip Morris, mainly driven by Russia, partly offset by Argentina and Italy; Dji Sam Soe in Indonesia, notably reflecting the continued strong performance of its Magnum Mild 16s variant launched in the second quarter of 2017; and Fortune in the Philippines, reflecting the favorable impact of its narrowed retail price gap to competitors' products.\nThe increase in PMI's heated tobacco unit shipment volume was driven by East Asia & Australia, primarily Japan and Korea.\nFINANCIAL SUMMARY\nFinancial Summary -\nQuarters Ended March 31,\nChange\nFav./(Unfav.)

We’re building our future on smoke-free products that are a much better consumer choice than continuing to smoke cigarettes. Through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation, we aim to ensure that our smoke-free products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements. Our vision is that these products ultimately replace cigarettes to the benefit of adult smokers, society, our company and our shareholders. For more information, see www.pmi.com and www.pmiscience.com .\nForward-Looking and Cautionary Statements\nThis press release contains projections of future results and other forward-looking statements. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. In the event that risks or uncertainties materialize, or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. Pursuant to the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, PMI is identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by PMI.\nPMI's business risks include: excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures; increasing marketing and regulatory restrictions that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or ban certain of our products; health concerns relating to the use of tobacco products and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; litigation related to tobacco use; intense competition; the effects of global and individual country economic, regulatory and political developments, natural disasters and conflicts; changes in adult smoker behavior; lost revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband and cross-border purchases; governmental investigations; unfavorable currency exchange rates and currency devaluations, and limitations on the ability to repatriate funds; adverse changes in applicable corporate tax laws; adverse changes in the cost and quality of tobacco and other agricultural products and raw materials; and the integrity of its information systems. PMI's future profitability may also be adversely affected should it be unsuccessful in its attempts to produce and commercialize reduced-risk products or if regulation or taxation do not differentiate between such products and cigarettes; if it is unable to successfully introduce new products, promote brand equity, enter new markets or improve its margins through increased prices and productivity gains; if it is unable to expand its brand portfolio internally or through acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships; or if it is unable to attract and retain the best global talent.\nPMI is further subject to other risks detailed from time to time in its publicly filed documents, including the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. PMI cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not a complete discussion of all potential risks and uncertainties. PMI does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that it may make from time to time, except in the normal course of its public disclosure obligations.\nAppendix 1 PHILIP MORRIS
