    "text": "ROME, April 3 (Reuters) - Italy’s competition watchdog is considering asking for more details on a deal broadcaster Mediaset signed last week with Sky’s Italian unit, a source said on Tuesday.\n“They will decide quickly whether to ask for all the documentation,” the source close to the matter said.\nOn Friday Mediaset said the deal would allow it to broadcast its pay-TV Premium Cinema and TV series channels on Sky’s satellite platform.\nSky Italia would be able to use Mediaset’s Premium pay-TV digital platform for its own offering of services and channels.
