(the “ Company ” or “ Lineage ”) (CSE:BUDD) is pleased to provide an update on its previously announced binding letter of intent (“ LOI ”) to acquire a 100% interest in Altai Partners LLC (“ Altai ”), a California limited liability company (the \" Acquisition \"). Concurrent to its agreement acquiring a 45% ownership interest in Lucrum Enterprises Inc., d/b/a LUX Cannabis Dispensary (“ LUX ”), Altai has entered into an additional agreement to acquire the remaining 55% ownership interest in LUX. Upon completion of the Acquisition, Lineage will hold a 100% ownership interest in LUX, one of only 16 licensed dispensaries operating in San Jose, California, among the world’s most respected and welcoming cannabis markets.\nTransaction Terms:\nUnder the terms of the Acquisition, the Company will purchase a 100% interest in Altai in exchange for the following consideration:\n$3,450,000 in common shares in the capital of Lineage (“ Common Shares ”) priced at USD $0.20 per Common Share, to be issued to the Seller upon closing USD $750,000 to be lent to Altai under a Promissory Note at 12% annual interest, maturing May 31, 2018. This note will become a loan to subsidiary after completion of the Acquisition Lineage, under its ownership of Altai, will assume USD $1,200,000 in payment obligations towards Altai’s purchase of LUX. This obligation includes four cash payments to LUX shareholders of USD $300,000, beginning April 28, 2018 and ending December 30, 2018\nLUX currently holds 4 licenses including Retail, Cultivation, Extraction, and Delivery. Upon completion of the Acquisition, Lineage intends to leverage on these licenses to expand its presence through development of the entire Bay Area market and beyond. In the near-term, the Company intends to commence development of a cannabis delivery service for LUX’s various product offerings and is currently engaged in discussions with multiple parties with a view towards establishing a dominant cannabis delivery business. Cannabis delivery services have and continue to experience significant growth in California since legalization, and development of its own delivery service will allow Lineage to provide a further integrated customer offering, and further develop its strategic objective of becoming one of the premier vertically integrated cannabis companies in the Bay Area.\nErnie Arreola, CEO of LUX, commented, “It’s very exciting for myself and my partners to be joining Lineage. Their professionalism has been evident throughout this process and I believe our combined entity will bring significant value to the Bay Area cannabis market.”\nDavid Drutz, CEO of Lineage added, “Lineage acquiring a 100% interest in LUX, one of San Jose’s very few licensed dispensaries will position us well to expand on our market presence. We view California as the most lucrative market in the U.S. This as an exciting opportunity to quickly begin our expansion across the state which fits well with our overall growth strategy going forward.”\nCompletion of the Acquisition will be subject to satisfactory completion of due diligence, execution of a definitive agreement, all required approvals and consents, as well as the completion of the Altai acquisition of 100% ownership interest in LUX. There can be no assurance that the Acquisition will be completed as proposed or at all.\nIn addition, the Company is pleased to comment on the recent approval of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (“ Omnibus Spending Bill ” or the “ Bill ”), which extended the Rohrabacher-Leahy Amendment (“ Rohrabacher-Leahy ”) until the end of September 2018. On March 22, 2018, the House of Representatives and Senate voted in favour of approving the Omnibus Spending Bill and it was signed into law the following day by the President of The United States. With the Bill’s approval comes an extension of Rohrabacher-Leahy Amendment until September 2018, which is represented by Section 538 of the Bill. Rohrabacher-Leahy Amendment prevents the US Department of Justice from using federal funds in enforcing federal law relating to medical cannabis, which effectively allows states to implement their own laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana. The amendment was first introduced in 2014 and has been reaffirmed annually since then. Lineage commends this development and welcomes the opportunity to roll out its corporate strategy in an more certain legal environment.\nFor further information, please contact:\nDavid Drutz, CEO\nLineage Grow Company Ltd.\n(416) 479-4142\nEmail: ddrutz@lineagegrow.com\nThis news release may contain forward-looking statements and information based on current expectations.
