(“Intuitive”) (Nasdaq:ISRG), a global technology leader in robotic-assisted, minimally invasive surgery, today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nQ1 Highlights\nWorldwide da Vinci procedures grew approximately 15% compared with the first quarter of 2017, driven primarily by growth in U.S. general surgery procedures and worldwide urologic procedures. The Company shipped 185 da Vinci Surgical Systems compared with 133 in the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 revenue of $848 million grew approximately 25% compared with $680 million for the first quarter of 2017. Foreign currency changes contributed approximately three percentage points to the revenue growth. First quarter 2017 revenue also reflected a $23 million revenue deferral. First quarter 2018 GAAP net income was $288 million, or $2.44 per diluted share, compared with $181 million, or $1.57 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 non-GAAP* net income was $288 million, or $2.44 per diluted share, compared with $197 million, or $1.71 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017. In Japan, 12 da Vinci procedures within the specialties of general surgery, gynecology, and cardiothoracic surgery were granted national reimbursement status in Japan effective April 1, 2018 and our da Vinci X system was approved on April 4, 2018.\nQ1 Financial Summary\nGross profit, income from operations, net income (loss), net income (loss) per diluted share, and diluted shares are reported on a GAAP and non-GAAP* basis. The non-GAAP* measures are described below and are reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures at the end of this release.\nEffective in the first quarter 2018, the Company adopted a new revenue standard using the full retrospective method and all historical information has been restated accordingly. As a result, first quarter 2017 total revenue increased by $5 million and GAAP and non-GAAP* net income increased by $1 million, or $0.01 per diluted share.\nFirst quarter 2018 revenue was $848 million, an increase of approximately 25% compared with $680 million in the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2017 results reflected the deferral of $23 million of revenue associated with a customer trade-out program.\nFirst quarter 2018 instrument and accessory revenue increased by approximately 21% to $460 million, compared with $381 million for the first quarter of 2017, primarily driven by approximately 15% growth in da Vinci procedure volume.\nFirst quarter 2018 systems revenue increased by approximately 46% to $235 million, compared with $161 million for the first quarter of 2017. The Company shipped 185 da Vinci Surgical Systems in the first quarter of 2018, compared with 133 in the first quarter of 2017. The first quarter 2018 system shipments included 43 systems shipped under operating lease arrangements, compared with 21 during the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2017 systems revenue also reflected the impact of the trade-out program revenue deferral noted above.

Statements using words such as “estimates,” “projects,” “believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “targeted” and similar words and expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or release any revisions to these forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\n*About Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), the Company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share (“EPS”), and non-GAAP diluted shares. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance and liquidity by excluding items such as intangible asset charges, share-based compensation (“SBC”) expenses, and other special items. Intangible asset charges consist of non-cash charges, such as the amortization of intangible assets, as well as in-process R&D charges. The Company believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to its historical performance and liquidity. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the performance of the Company’s business.\nNon-GAAP gross profit . The Company defines non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit excluding intangible asset charges, expenses related to SBC, and litigation charges.\nNon-GAAP income from operations . The Company defines non-GAAP income from operations as income from operations excluding intangible asset charges, expenses related to SBC, and litigation charges and recoveries.\nNon-GAAP net income and EPS . The Company defines non-GAAP net income as net income (loss) excluding intangible asset charges; expenses related to SBC; litigation charges and recoveries, net of the related tax effects; and tax adjustments including the excess tax benefits or deficiencies associated with share-based compensation arrangements, the provisional income tax expense related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“2017 Tax Act”), and the net tax effects related to intra-entity transfers of non-inventory assets. The Company excludes income tax expense related to the 2017 Tax Act because of its one-time nature as well as the excess tax benefits or deficiencies associated with share-based compensation arrangements and the tax effects associated with non-cash amortization of deferred tax assets related to intra-entity non-inventory transfers as the Company does not believe these items correlate with the on-going results of its core operations. The tax effects of the non-GAAP items are determined by applying a calculated non-GAAP effective tax rate, which is commonly referred to as the with-and-without method. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that these non-GAAP adjustments had on the Company’s operating results. The Company’s calculated non-GAAP effective tax rate is generally higher than its GAAP effective tax rate. The Company defines non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by non-GAAP diluted shares which are calculated as GAAP weighted average outstanding shares plus dilutive potential shares outstanding during the period.\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP measures versus measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP EPS exclude items such as intangible asset charges, SBC, excess tax benefits or deficiencies associated with share-based compensation arrangements, and non-cash amortization of deferred tax assets related to intra-entity transfer of non-inventory assets, which are primarily recurring items. SBC has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in the Company’s business. In addition, the components of the costs that the Company excludes in its calculation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS may differ from the components that its peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management addresses these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS together with net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nThree months ended In millions (except per share data) March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 Revenue: Instruments and accessories $ 460.3 $ 457.1 $ 380.8 Systems 234.5 284.5 160.8 Services 152.7 150.4 138.0 Total revenue 847.5 892.0 679.6 Cost of revenue: Product 201.5 210.7 165.5 Service 52.2 47.3 44.3 Total cost of revenue 253.7 258.0 209.8 Gross profit 593.8 634.0 469.8 Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative 221.6 217.9 202.9 Research and development 95.5 87.1 73.5 Total operating expenses 317.1 305.0 276.4 Income from operations 276.7 329.0 193.4 Interest and other income, net 13.2 12.3 8.7 Income before taxes 289.9 341.3 202.1 Income tax expense (1) 2.6 372.8 21.3 Net income (loss) 287.3 (31.5 ) 180.8 Less: net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (0.3 ) — — Net income (loss) attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. $ 287.6 $ (31.5 ) $ 180.8 Net income (loss) per share attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc.: Basic $ 2.55 $ (0.28 ) $ 1.62 Diluted (2) $ 2.44 $ (0.28 ) $ 1.57 Weighted average shares outstanding: Basic 112.8 112.2 111.9 Diluted* 118.0 112.2 115.5 (1) Income tax expense includes the effect of the following item: Excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation arrangements $ (54.7 ) $ (19.9 ) $ (32.6 ) Income tax expense related to the 2017 Tax Act** $ — $ 317.8 $ — (2) Diluted net income (loss) per share includes the effect of the following items: Excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation arrangements $ 0.46 $ 0.18 $ 0.28 Income tax expense related to the 2017 Tax Act** $ — $ (2.83 ) $ — (*) The fourth quarter 2017 diluted share amount did not include approximately 5.2 million shares, because including such shares would have been anti-dilutive due to the net loss incurred in the period.
