Castaldini is a veteran marketing executive with experience leading go-to-market strategies for GE Digital, Bit Stew Systems, and Software AG. Castaldini will assume responsibility for global marketing strategy and business development and will report directly to Michael Monteith, CEO of ThoughtWire.\n\"We are excited to have Franco join the ThoughtWire team,\" says Monteith. \"His deep understanding of the IIoT platform and application markets and successful track record growing early stage companies make him a perfect fit.
