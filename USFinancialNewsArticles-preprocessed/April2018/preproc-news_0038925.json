    "text": "April 18, 2018 / 4:56 AM / Updated 10 hours ago Rugby - Five Spain players banned for abusing referee Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Rugby Europe has handed out bans to five Spain players who confronted a referee at the end of their shock defeat by Belgium in a World Cup qualifying match last month. \nThe players were angered by the performance of Romanian referee Vlad Iordachescu after the 18-10 defeat in Brussels allowed Romania to qualify for the 2019 World Cup in Japan at Spainâ€™s expense. \nScrumhalf Sebastien Rouet was handed the longest ban of 43 weeks for physical and verbal abuse of the match official, the independent judicial committee appointed by Rugby Europe said in a statement here \nFellow scrumhalf Guillaume Rouet was banned for 36 weeks for the same charges. Flankers Pierre Barthere and Lucas Guillaume, as well as flyhalf Mathieu Belie, all received 14-week bans for using threatening actions and words at a match official. \nA misconduct complaint against the Spanish Rugby Union will be heard at a later date, the statement added. \nWorld Rugby said earlier this month that it would convene an independent disputes panel to review the match. \nSpain must now beat Portugal to earn a two-legged playoff against Samoa for a place at the World Cup.
