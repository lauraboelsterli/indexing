Soccer Football - Premier League - West Bromwich Albion vs Huddersfield Town - The Hawthorns, West Bromwich, Britain - February 24, 2018 West Bromwich Albion's Gareth Barry warms up before the match Action Images via Reuters/Paul Childs \nBarry injured his knee towards the end of February and has not played since West Brom’s 2-1 defeat by Huddersfield Town on Feb. 24. The 37-year-old has made 29 appearances for the club in all competitions this season. \n“Gareth Barry will undergo minor surgery on his knee injury next week... (and) is likely to be ruled out for the remainder of the Premier League season,” West Brom said in a statement on their website. \nThe injury layoff is a further setback for Barry, who was one of four West Brom players interviewed by Spanish police over the alleged theft of a taxi during a training camp in Spain in February. \nRelegation-threatened West Brom are bottom of the league with 20 points from 32 games and take on fellow strugglers Swansea City on Saturday.
