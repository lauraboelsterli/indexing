    "text": "3 COMMENTS The unexpected strength of the eurozone recovery was the big surprise of 2017 and one of the main reasons why the U.K. economy outperformed gloomy pre-Brexit forecasts. \nEurozone output expanded by 2.3% in 2017, the strongest growth for a decade and far ahead of the consensus forecast among independent economists at the start of the year of growth of just 1.3%. Business and consumer confidence at the start of 2018 was the highest for 18 years, prompting economists to upgrade their expectations for growth this year to an average of 2.4%, up from a forecast of just 1.5% a year ago.\nBut are the wheels now coming off the recovery? \nA string of weak data points to a disappointing first quarter. German exports of goods were down by 3.2% in February compared with January, defying consensus expectations of a 0.4% rise. German industrial production also fell by 1.5% in February, compared with a forecast of a 0.3% rise. \nFresh data this week suggests the slowdown is spreading: Italian industrial production decreased by 0.5% in February compared with the previous month, while manufacturing output fell in France for a second consecutive month.\nThis disappointment is reflected in equity markets: The Stoxx 600 index of leading European stocks is down 7% from its January peak.\nOf course, a couple of months of weak data may not signify anything much. Most economists are currently inclined to think this is a temporary dip, offering explanations ranging from the cold winter across much of Europe, to the strength of the euro, to a bad dose of the flu which pushed up sickness rates in Germany. \nOthers have noted that recent survey data, which also has been weaker than expected, still points to healthy levels of growth: The eurozone composite PMI—a broad measure of economic activity—fell from 58.8 in January to 55.2 in March. That is still consistent with first quarter growth of 0.7%, lower than the 0.9% forecast in January but a long way short of a downturn.\nEven so, there are several issues that will need to be watched closely in the coming months which have the potential to turn a slowdown into something more troubling. \nThe first is that even with growth slowing, some parts of the eurozone may still be at risk of over-heating. That’s because the eurozone has been expanding for several years above its long-term potential growth rate—the rate at which an economy can grow without generating inflation—which is widely estimated to be a meager 1.5%. This reflects the continent’s demographic challenges and the inflexibility of many eurozone economies. \nAlready there is worrying evidence of bottlenecks in some industries and reports of skills shortages in many countries, not least in France despite unemployment of 9.2%. The risk is that supply-side constraints hold back growth, while pushing up inflation.\nA second concern relates to global-trade tensions.\nThe eurozone is particularly vulnerable to any disruption to trade: It runs a vast current account surplus equivalent to 3.6% of its output, which means it is highly reliant on foreign demand to fill its factory order books. \nThe eurozone has been the big winner from China’s booming economy in recent years: Exports to China were up 21.9% in 2017, while net trade was the biggest contributor to eurozone growth last year at 1.3%. Even the recent pickup in capital expenditure, which contributed 0.5% to eurozone gross domestic product growth in 2017, was in large part driven by Chinese demand. Indeed, some of the current slowdown appears to reflect a slowdown in Chinese growth and tighter Chinese credit conditions.\nThe third concern relates to global-liquidity conditions which have been tightening all year as the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates and started to shrink its holdings of government bonds and the European Central Bank has slowed the pace of its own bond-buying. \nU.S. 10-year Treasury bond yields already have risen from close to 2% in September to 2.8% today. Yields could yet be driven higher by a combination of increased bond issuance needed to fund President Donald Trump’s tax cuts and expectations of higher inflation as the extra stimulus is applied to an economy already running at full capacity. \nRising interest rates against a backdrop of slowing global growth could trigger fresh worries about the vast quantities of private-sector debt issued during recent years across developed markets, raising the risk of another bout of market-driven economic instability, notes Ian Harnett of Absolute Strategy Research. Markets that may be vulnerable to new credit risks include the U.S. corporate bond markets, which have grown by 50% in four years; the so-called CANNS (Canada, Australia, Norway, New Zealand and Sweden); and highly leveraged eurozone economies such as France and the Netherlands.\nOf course, the eurozone’s ability to withstand these risks would be enhanced if it had a compelling economic story to tell, perhaps in the form of reforms designed to improve its productivity at a national level or strengthen its resilience at the eurozone level. \nIn recent years, the currency bloc has been able to count on remarkably buoyant market conditions as investors have piled into eurozone assets, eager to play the recovery trade while the economy rebounded from its debt crisis. But with growth now possibly slowing and in the absence of meaningful reform efforts anywhere other than in France, that trade looks to have played out. \nIndeed, the eurozone’s greatest challenge may simply be to maintain investor interest.",
