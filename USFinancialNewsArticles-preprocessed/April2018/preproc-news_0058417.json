That pointed to a higher open for the Japanese index, which last finished at 22,319.61.\nElsewhere, the dollar stayed above the 91.00 level against a basket of major currencies. The dollar index last traded at 91.561.\nThe Japanese yen traded at 109.32 to the greenback and the Australian dollar last traded at $0.7555.\nThe euro traded at $1.2103 on Friday morning Asia time. Overnight, the European Central Bank held interest rates steady amid signs the euro area’s growth outlook may have softened.\nOil prices rose overnight amid concerns over geopolitical developments, particularly concerns about Iran .\nA top advisor to Iran’s supreme leader said Tehran would not accept any change to the 2015 nuclear deal, Reuters reported. The news wire said Western signatories to the agreement were preparing a new package to persuade U.S. President Donald Trump to stick with the accord.\nTrump will decide by May 12 whether to restore sanctions on Iran that could result in a reduction of Iranian oil exports, according to Reuters.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said he expects the U.S. to withdraw from the Iran deal in the coming weeks. He described the reversal of American policy on international agreements, including Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord, as “insane.”\nU.S. crude was up 14 cents at $68.19 per barrel while global benchmark Brent added 74 cents to $74.74.
