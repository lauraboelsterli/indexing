    "text": "Ondrej Kase scored 1:34 into overtime after the Ducks rallied from a two-goal deficit in the third period, and Anaheim defeated the visiting Colorado Avalanche 4-3 Sunday to move past the Los Angeles Kings into third place in the Pacific Division.\nKase came in from the left side, sped around defenseman Samuel Girard and fired a shot over the right shoulder of goalie Jonathan Bernier for the game-winner.\nAndrew Cogliano had a goal and an assist, and Ryan Kesler and Adam Henrique also scored for Anaheim, which moved a point ahead of the idle Kings. Los Angeles dropped into the first Western Conference wild-card spot with three games to go.\nJohn Gibson, named the NHL’s Third Star for the Month of March earlier on Sunday, stopped nine of 10 shots for the Ducks but was replaced by Ryan Miller to start the second period after being involved in a collision with Gabriel Landeskog near the end of the first period. It marked the sixth time this season that Miller, who made 19 saves, replaced Gibson in a game because of an injury.\nTyson Jost scored two goals and Alexander Kerfoot had a goal and an assist for Colorado, which gained a point to move into the second wild card spot ahead of the St. Louis Blues.\nBernier had 38 saves for the Avalanche. He was making his first start since March 10 in place of Semyon Varlamov, who sustained a knee injury in a 5-0 blanking of the Chicago Blackhawks on Friday night.\nAnaheim rallied to tie it 3-3 midway through the third period with goals by Henrique, his 23rd off a feed by Corey Perry at 7:43, and by Kesler on wrist shot from the slot just 96 seconds later.\nKerfoot started the scoring just 76 seconds into the game without even firing a shot at the goal. The Avalanche center won a faceoff in the right circle, and the puck caromed off the skate of Perry in the slot and just inside the far post past a surprised Gibson.\nAnaheim tied it five minutes later when Cogliano, off a nice clearing feed by Jakob Silfverberg, came in on a breakaway and after a couple of fakes beat Bernier on his stick side from the left side of the net.\nJost then scored two goals in a little over 11 minutes put the Avalanche ahead 3-1. The first came on a power play at 1:04 of the second period when he backhanded a rebound of a Nathan MacKinnon shot past Miller’s glove side.\nThe second came after Jost intercepted a pass in his own zone and then passed ahead to Kerfoot, who returned it to him near the top of the left circle. Jost fired a wrist shot over Miller’s left shoulder at 12:10 of the middle period.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
