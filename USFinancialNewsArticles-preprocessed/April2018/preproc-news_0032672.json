    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS, Tile Shop Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq:TTS) (the “Company”), a specialty retailer of natural stone and man-made tiles, setting and maintenance materials, and related accessories, today announced results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Summary\nComparable Store Sales Declined 6.8%\n70.3% Gross Margin\nDiluted Earnings per Share of $0.08\nGAAP Net Income of $4.0 million; Adjusted EBITDA of $13.8 million\nOpened 2 new stores in Q1 – 140 stores open at end of Q1\nCompleted 4 store remodels in Q1\nManagement Commentary\n“During the first quarter, we eliminated advertised price promotions which contributed to an increase in our gross margin rate back to the high-end of where we typically expect. This was a great early sign that our key initiatives are taking hold as we return to what Tile Shop is known for,” said Robert Rucker, interim CEO. “Without using the promotional lever in the quarter we did experience the volatility in traffic and sales at comparable stores relative to last year that we expected. However, we are getting our new tile product on the floors of our showrooms fast and I am encouraged by the initial sales results from the new products we’ve recently added to our assortment. We are also making strides with winning back our pros, as pro feedback continues to be positive and pro sales metrics are starting to reflect this fact. In addition, our investments in remodels, store compensation and training are helping us build on our commitment to provide exceptional service to all of our customers. Although much work remains, we are confident we are on the right path.”\nThree Months Ended (unaudited, amounts in thousands, except per March 31, share data) 2018 2017 Net sales $ 91,134 $ 92,135 Net sales (decline) growth (1) (1.1 )% 8.8 % Comparable store sales (decline) growth (2) (6.8 )% 4.9 % Gross margin rate 70.3 % 70.3 % Income from operations as a % of net sales 6.7 % 14.7 % Net income $ 4,011 $ 8,009 Net income per diluted share $ 0.08 $ 0.15 Adjusted EBITDA $ 13,763 $ 20,747 Adjusted EBITDA as a % of net sales 15.1 % 22.5 % Number of stores open at the end of period 140 126 (1) As compared to the prior year period.\n(2) Comparable store sales growth is the percentage change in sales of comparable stores period over period. A store is considered comparable on the first day of the 13th full month of operation. When a store is relocated, it is excluded from the comparable store sales growth calculation. Comparable store sales growth amounts include total charges to customers less any actual returns. Comparable store sales data reported by other companies may be prepared on a different basis and therefore may not be useful for purposes of comparing the Company’s results to those of other businesses.\nHIGHLIGHTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER 2018\nNet Sales\nNet sales decreased $1.0 million, or 1.1%, from $92.1 million in the first quarter of 2017 to $91.1 million in the first quarter of 2018. The decrease was due to a comparable store sales decrease of 6.8%, or $6.3 million, offset by net sales of $5.3 million from stores not included in the comparable store base. The decrease in comparable store sales in the first quarter was traffic-related due in part to the Company’s elimination of advertised price promotions.\nGross Profit\nGross profit decreased $0.7 million, or 1.1%, from $64.7 million in the first quarter of 2017 to $64.0 million in the first quarter of 2018. Gross margin rate was 70.3% for the first quarter of both 2017 and 2018. The gross margin rate improved sequentially from the 66.8% reported for the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to decreased promotional activity.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $6.7 million, or 13.1%, from $51.2 million in the first quarter of 2017 to $57.9 million in the first quarter of 2018. The $6.7 million increase was driven primarily by costs associated with opening and operating fourteen new stores over the past twelve months.\nInventory\nInventory increased $19.0 million, or 27.5%, from $69.3 million at March 31, 2017 to $88.3 million at March 31, 2018. The increase was the result of the Company’s strategy to expand its product assortment and improve its product presentation.\nLong-Term Debt\nDuring the quarter, the Company reduced its long-term debt by approximately $1.9 million. As part of its ongoing efforts to enhance its capital structure, the Company amended its credit agreement to reduce the minimum fixed charge ratio to 1.35 and to increase the maximum rent adjusted leverage ratio to 4.0.\nStore Expansion and Investment\nThe Company opened two new retail stores in the first quarter of 2018, consisting of its second Connecticut location in Hartford, CT and its third location in the Austin, TX area in Round Rock, TX. As of March 31, 2018, the Company operates 140 stores in 31 states and the District of Columbia. The Company also remodeled four stores during the first quarter of 2018.\nDIVIDEND\nThe Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per common share. The dividend is payable May 11, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 30, 2018.\nOUTLOOK\nThe Company reiterates its previously communicated annual outlook:\nCapital investment of approximately $27 to $32 million, including remodeling approximately 30 stores to support its product presentation strategy. Inventory investment of approximately 25% to 35% year over year, over the next several quarters, to support our product assortment strategy. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense increase of approximately $5 to $7 million to support its service strategy, including increased expenses for (1) the addition of regional sales leader positions, (2) sales and warehouse staff compensation, and (3) customer relationship management and content management capabilities. The $5 to $7 million increase in SG&A expense is incremental to the expected SG&A expense increases associated with a full year of operations for the fifteen stores opened in 2017 and the three new stores opening in 2018.\nLonger term, the Company remains committed to achieving both Adjusted EBITDA margin and pretax return on capital employed of greater than 20%.\nNON-GAAP INFORMATION\nThe Company presents Adjusted EBITDA to provide useful information to investors regarding the Company’s performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 was $13.8 million compared with $20.7 million for the first quarter of 2017. See the “Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation” table below for a reconciliation of GAAP net income to Adjusted EBITDA.\nAdjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\nThree Months Ended ($ in thousands) March 31, 2018 2017 GAAP net income $ 4,011 $ 8,009 Interest expense 554 485 Income taxes 1,581 5,075 Depreciation and amortization 7,000 6,336 Stock-based compensation 617 842 Adjusted EBITDA $ 13,763 $ 20,747 (1 ) (1) In prior periods, the Company also adjusted for special charges, including shareholder and other litigation costs. The Company has recast the Adjusted EBITDA presentation for the three months ended March 31, 2017 to conform to the current presentation.\nWebcast and Conference Call\nAs announced on April 6, 2018, the Company will host a conference call via live webcast for investors and other interested parties beginning at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, April 19, 2018.

In prior periods, the Company also adjusted for special charges, including shareholder and other litigation costs. The Company has recast the Adjusted EBITDA presentation for the three months ended March 31, 2017 to conform to the current presentation. Adjusted EBITDA margin is equal to Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales.\nThe Company believes that these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. Company management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare Company performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, for purposes of determining management incentive compensation, and for budgeting and planning purposes. These measures are used in monthly financial reports prepared for management and the Board of Directors. The Company believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the Company’s financial measures with other specialty retailers, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.\nCompany management does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitations of these non-GAAP financial measures are that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. In order to compensate for these limitations, management presents non-GAAP financial measures in connection with GAAP results. The Company urges investors to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the business.\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis press release includes “forward looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “anticipate”, “believe”, “expect”, “estimate”, “plan”, “outlook”, and “project” and other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These forward looking statements include any statements regarding the Company’s strategic and operational plan and expected financial performance (including the financial performance of new stores). Forward looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved. Forward looking statements are based on information available at the time those statements are made and/or management’s good faith belief as of that time with respect to future events, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward looking statements, including but not limited to unforeseen events that may affect the retail market or the performance of the Company’s stores. The Company does not intend, and undertakes no duty, to update this information to reflect future events or circumstances. Investors are referred to the most recent reports filed with the SEC by the Company.\nTile Shop Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n($ in thousands, except share data)\n(Unaudited) (Audited) March 31, December 31, 2018 2017 Assets Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 7,152 $ 6,621 Restricted cash 835 855 Trade receivables, net 2,885 2,381 Inventories 88,317 85,259 Income tax receivable 4,616 5,726 Other current assets, net 6,559 4,717 Total Current Assets 110,364 105,559 Property, plant and equipment, net 150,156 151,405 Deferred tax assets 11,228 11,654 Other assets 1,947 2,107 Total Assets $ 273,695 $ 270,725 Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 25,986 $ 30,771 Current portion of long-term debt 9,459 8,833 Income tax payable 43 17 Other accrued liabilities 29,665 22,413 Total Current Liabilities 65,153 62,034 Long-term debt, net 15,692 18,182 Capital lease obligation, net 543 576 Deferred rent 41,958 41,290 Other long-term liabilities 4,477 4,769 Total Liabilities 127,823 126,851 Stockholders’ Equity: Common stock, par value $0.0001; authorized: 100,000,000 shares; issued and outstanding: 52,429,157 and 52,156,850 shares, respectively 5 5 Preferred stock, par value $0.0001; authorized: 10,000,000 shares; issued and outstanding: 0 shares - - Additional paid-in-capital 178,126 180,109 Accumulated deficit (32,288 ) (36,239 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss 29 (1 ) Total Stockholders' Equity 145,872 143,874 Total Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity $ 273,695 $ 270,725\nTile Shop Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n($ in thousands, except share, and per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net sales $ 91,134 $ 92,135 Cost of sales 27,096 27,390 Gross profit 64,038 64,745 Selling, general and administrative expenses 57,927 51,212 Income from operations 6,111 13,533 Interest expense (554 ) (485 ) Other income 35 36 Income before income taxes 5,592 13,084 Provision for income taxes (1,581 ) (5,075 ) Net income $ 4,011 $ 8,009\nTile Shop Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nRate Analysis\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Gross margin rate 70.3 % 70.3 % SG&A expense rate 63.6 % 55.6 % Income from operations margin rate 6.7 % 14.7 % Adjusted EBITDA margin rate 15.1 % 22.5 %\nTile Shop Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n($ in thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Cash Flows From Operating Activities Net income $ 4,011 $ 8,009 Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities: Depreciation & amortization 7,000 6,336 Amortization of debt issuance costs 167 174 Loss on disposals of property, plant and equipment 71 75 Deferred rent 1,039 710 Stock based compensation 617 842 Deferred income taxes 426 1,223 Changes in operating assets and liabilities: Trade receivables (504 ) (559 ) Inventories (3,058 ) 5,016 Prepaid expenses and other assets (1,771 ) 4,589 Accounts payable (6,085 ) (2,413 ) Income tax receivable / payable 1,135 3,888 Accrued expenses and other liabilities 6,810 (7,836 ) Net cash provided by operating activities 9,858 20,054 Cash Flows From Investing Activities Purchases of property, plant and equipment (4,846 ) (9,963 ) Net cash used in investing activities (4,846 ) (9,963 ) Cash Flows From Financing Activities Payments of long-term debt and capital lease obligations (16,904 ) (16,272 ) Advances on line of credit 15,000 15,000 Dividends paid (2,600 ) (2,581 ) Proceeds from exercise of stock options - 42 Employee taxes paid for shares withheld - (32 ) Net cash used in financing activities (4,504 ) (3,843 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 3 5 Net change in cash 511 6,253 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash beginning of period 7,476 10,336 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash end of period $ 7,987 $ 16,589 Supplemental disclosure of cash flow information Purchases of property, plant and equipment included in accounts payable and accrued expenses $ 1,895 $ 2,867 Cash paid for interest 558 481 Cash paid (received) for income taxes, net 1 (44 )\nSource:Tile Shop Holdings, Inc.",
