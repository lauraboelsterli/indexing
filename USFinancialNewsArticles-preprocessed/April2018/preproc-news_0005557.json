    "text": "TORONTO and SPOKANE, WA, April 4, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Hydro One Limited (\"Hydro One\") (TSX: H) and Avista Corporation (\"Avista\") (NYSE: AVA) today announced the achievement of an important milestone in the regulatory approval process of their proposed merger. The companies and the City and Borough of Juneau (CBJ), the only intervenor in the case, have reached a settlement agreement in the merger proceeding currently before the Regulatory Commission of Alaska (\"RCA\"). The settlement agreement has been filed with the RCA. Avista serves customers in Juneau, Alaska through its subsidiary utility, Alaska Electric Light and Power Company (\"AEL&P\").\n\"This positive step forward speaks to the long-term benefits of the union of Hydro One and Avista for customers, communities, employees and shareholders,\" said Mayo Schmidt, President and CEO, Hydro One. \"I would like to thank the CBJ for working with us to reach this significant milestone.\"\n\"We're pleased to have been able to collaborate with the CBJ, on behalf of the residents of Juneau, to arrive at an outcome that is beneficial and that represents Avista's continued commitment to the Juneau community,\" Avista President Dennis Vermillion said. \"AEL&P customers can expect their utility to continue to operate as it does today, with reliable energy service, local decision-making and a continued focus on community giving and support. We're excited about the future partnership with Hydro One and are confident that this partnership will benefit AEL&P's customers.\"\nThe settlement agreement includes specific commitments that preserve the ownership structure and current operations of AEL&P, ensure customer rates will not be impacted by the transaction, enhance community giving and provide a $1 million rate credit over five years for AEL&P's customers. This rate credit would begin at the close of the transaction.\nThe settlement also clarifies that the transaction will not affect the ownership of Snettisham or RCA approval requirements for any future transfer of Snettisham, formalizes AEL&P's interconnection process and outlines a process for a biennial AEL&P system and planning presentation.\nPlease refer to rca.alaska.gov for the joint application, full settlement agreement and complete list of commitments.\nThe settlement agreement is subject to RCA review and approval. The parties have requested a decision from the RCA within 30 days of filing the settlement agreement.\nAn all-party settlement agreement was filed with the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission on March 27, 2018. The transaction received approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on January 16, 2018 and from Avista shareholders on November 21, 2017. Hydro One and Avista continue to anticipate closing the transaction in the second half of 2018.\nApplications for regulatory approval of the transaction are still pending with utility commissions in Washington, Idaho, Oregon, Montana and Alaska. Approval must be obtained from the Federal Communications Commission. Also required is clearance by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, and compliance with applicable requirements under the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, as well as the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.\nAbout Hydro One Limited\nWe are Ontario's largest electricity transmission and distribution provider with more than 1.3 million valued customers, over C$25 billion in assets and 2017 annual revenues of nearly C$6 billion.
