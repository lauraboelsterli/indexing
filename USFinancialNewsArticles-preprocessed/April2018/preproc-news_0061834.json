    "text": "J.A. Happ struck out nine over seven innings, Yangervis Solarte, Teoscar Hernandez and Kevin Pillar hit solo homers and the Toronto Blue Jays ended a four-game losing streak Sunday afternoon with a 7-2 victory over the visiting Texas Rangers.\nHapp (4-1) allowed two runs and five hits and did not allow a walk as the Blue Jays avoided being swept in the three-game series to complete a 2-4 homestand.\nRenato Nunez homered for the Rangers.\nRangers starter Martin Perez (2-3) allowed four runs, five hits that included three home runs, four walks and had two strikeouts in four innings.\nNunez hit his first homer of the season in the second to give Texas a 1-0 lead.\nThe Blue Jays came back with two runs in the bottom of the inning.\nSolarte led off with his seventh homer of the season. Pillar walked and took second on an infield single by Russell Martin. Lourdes Gurriel Jr.’s grounder forced Martin at second and moved Pillar to third. Randal Grichuk hit a sacrifice fly to moderate left.\nHernandez hit his fourth homer of the season in the third.\nPillar led off the bottom of the fourth with his fourth homer of the season. The Blue Jays loaded the bases, but Steve Pearce lined into an inning-ending double play.\nThe Rangers scored once in the sixth when Delino DeShields doubled, took third on a groundout and scored on Isiah Kiner-Falefa’s groundout to shortstop.\nThe Blue Jays took a 5-2 lead in the sixth. Martin reached first on an error by third baseman Nunez, took third on Gurriel’s single and scored when the Rangers could not complete the double play on Grichuk’s fielder’s choice grounder to second.\nThe Blue Jays scored twice in the seventh. Pearce walked, and Hernandez doubled against reliever Tony Barnette. Justin Smoak hit a sacrifice fly against Jake Diekman. Solarte added an RBI single.\nRyan Tepera struck out two in a perfect eighth and Aaron Loup pitched around a double in the ninth.\nBefore the game, the Blue Jays optioned second baseman Devon Travis to Triple-A Buffalo and recalled right-handed reliever Carlos Ramirez.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
