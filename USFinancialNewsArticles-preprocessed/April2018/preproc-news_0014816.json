    "text": "Jakob Silfverberg had a goal and two assists and Andrew Cogliano and Josh Manson each had a goal and an assist as the Anaheim Ducks moved into third place in the Pacific Division with a 5-3 victory over the Dallas Stars on Friday night at the Honda Center in Anaheim, Calif.\nRickard Rakell and Derek Grant also scored goals and Ryan Getzlaf chipped in with a pair of assists for Anaheim (43-25-13, 99) which leapfrogged the idle Los Angeles Kings (45-28-8, 98) into third place in the battle for home ice in the first round of the playoffs. The San Jose Sharks remain one point ahead of the Ducks with one game remaining for each team.\nAnaheim, which improved to 26-10-5 at home with its seventh straight win at the Honda Center, finishes the regular season on Saturday night at Arizona while the Kings host Dallas and the Sharks host Minnesota.\nRyan Miller had 23 saves to improve to 11-6-6 this season and tie Tom Barrasso (369) for second on the all-time wins list for U.S. born goalies. He needs five more to equal John Vanbiesbrouck for the top spot on that list.\nJamie Benn had a goal and an assist and Marc Methot and Radek Faksa also scored for Dallas (41-32-8, 90) which had a two-game win streak snapped. Mike McKenna stopped 28 shots in net for the Stars.\nThe Ducks, who entered the game with a 28-4-7 mark when scoring first, didn’t waste any time taking the lead with Silfverberg finishing a 3-on-2 rush by deflecting Manson’s pass into the right corner of the net for his 17th goal of the season at the 2:28 mark of the first period.\nRakell made it 2-0 just four minutes later with his 33rd goal of the season on a power play, getting a pass from Getzlaf in the slot and then tucking in his own rebound inside the left post after McKenna stopped his backhand attempt.\nMethot scored his first goal in 108 games dating back to March of 2016 when he beat Miller with a wrist shot through a screen from the top of the left circle to cut it to 2-1, but Grant answered with his 12th of the year to give Anaheim a 3-1 lead after the first period.\nManson batted in a rebound of a Getzlaf shot into a wide-open left side of the net to make it 4-1 early in the second period, but just three minutes later, Faksa deflected a Greg Pateryn shot to give Dallas life with his 17th goal of the season.\nBenn then scored his 33rd of the season at the 2:52 mark of the third period with a wrist shot from the top of the slot that went over Miller’s left shoulder to cut Anaheim’s lead to 4-3. Cogliano sealed the win with a breakaway goal with 5:25 remaining.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
