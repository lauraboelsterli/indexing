    "text": "1 COMMENTS Investor sentiment has quickly shifted from extremely optimistic to outright bearish—an encouraging contrarian signal for those market participants who have long worried Wall Street was overly bullish.\nAs concerns about trade and tech stocks heat up, investors are at their most pessimistic in more than seven months, according to the American Association of Individual Investors’ most recent weekly sentiment survey, which measures participants’ outlook for the stock market over the next six months. In January, survey participants were at their most bullish since late 2010.\nThe swift turnaround comes as investors pull money out of equity funds, stock market valuations drop and an increasing number of put options are taken out on the S&P 500 to protect against declines relative to calls that bet on gains. Meanwhile, the Cboe Volatility Index—known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge” is up 85% on the year.\n“There’s more of an extreme fear reaction now,” said Edmund Shing, global head of equity derivative strategy at BNP Paribas . “As a contrarian indicator, that makes me actually bullish,” he said.\nInvestors often worry most when everybody else in the market gets very bullish, with many analysts noting that Wall Street optimism has often reached its highs right before big market falls.\nBear and bull statues outside the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Photo: Alex Kraus/Bloomberg News When the mood among investors sours, many market participants think it indicates selling pressure is bottoming out and that more money could enter the market, giving the potential for gains as long as the economy remains on track.\nThe S&P 500 is down 0.4% so far this year, even as earnings expectations have climbed, share buybacks have risen and the economy has continued to grow.\nMr. Shing said signals from options markets, equity flows and sentiment gauges are collectively the most downbeat he has seen since shortly before the U.S. presidential election in November 2016. U.S. retail investors appear to be the biggest sellers of stocks, while institutional fund managers have largely bought more protection against further falls or shifted some money out of equities and into short-term debt, he added, based on his analysis of fund redemptions and options markets.\nInvestors have redeemed a net $25 billion from the popular SPDR S&P 500 exchange-traded fund so far this year, according to FactSet. More broadly, U.S. equity funds overall have posted $48 billion in year-to-date redemptions, according to fund tracker EPFR Global’s end of quarter data.\nMeanwhile, the National Association of Active Investment Managers Exposure Index, which tracks active money managers’ average exposure to U.S. equity markets, fell to 55.57 this week, down from an average of 71 in the first quarter of the year and roughly 63 since mid-2006. It was as high as 121 in December.\nTo be sure, some metrics continue to suggest sentiment is far from extremely bearish.\nOptions and derivatives on the S&P 500 currently show that investors expect more volatility ahead, but not necessarily a huge decline for the index, said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading & derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.\n“I’d expect the put-call ratio [on the S&P 500] to be a lot higher than it is now if there were concern of a much bigger downturn,” he added.\nStill, the moves mark a sharp turnaround from the mood in late 2017 and most of January, when investors poured record amounts of money into equity funds and the amount of cash squirreled away by institutional fund managers hit five-year lows, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s monthly survey.\nEd Keon, chief investment strategist at investment firm QMA, recalls speaking at an investor conference in January, when the market was already up 7% for 2018. “I remember saying the S&P 500 expected return was 10% for the year, and people mocked me for being overly cautious,” he said.\n“Expectations have tempered a bit,” Mr. Keon said.\nMany investors think the caution is warranted, given rising interest rates, rising concerns about a trade war between the U.S. and China and mounting pressure on the technology sector .\nBut some view the shift in mood as a reassuring sign about the health of the market.\n“With investor optimism lower now, it should be easier for equity markets to make further gains from here if global growth remains healthy,” said Mike Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. The firm is maintaining their sizable allocation to U.S. and emerging-market equities despite the recent downturn. The exuberance is gone, and stocks have gotten cheaper, Mr. Bell said.\nEquity valuations remain elevated compared with their historical averages, but they have come down. The forward price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 has fallen to 16.4—its lowest since November 2016—from as high as 18.6 in late January. The Stoxx Europe 600 and Japan’s Nikkei are also trading around their lowest forward PE since 2016.\n“You’ve seen a correction that has taken valuations back to less stretched levels and taken sentiment back to less stretched levels,” said John Stopford, head of multiasset income at Investec Asset Management. After an unusual period of extreme bullishness, the market mentality is now back to “climbing a wall of worry,” he said, a supportive factor in his belief that stocks have more room to climb.\nWrite to Riva Gold at riva.gold@wsj.com",
