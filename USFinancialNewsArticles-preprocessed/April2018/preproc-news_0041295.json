    "text": "Alpha males hurt alpha: Hedge fund managers with high testosterone underperform April 19, 2018 \nHigh testosterone managers “trade more frequently, have a stronger preference for lottery-like stocks and are more likely to succumb to the disposition effect,” the report said. \nThe researchers also found that hedge-fund investors — specifically, hedge fund-of-funds — select managers based on their own testosterone levels. In other words, higher testosterone fund-of-hedge funds are more likely to invest in higher testosterone managers, while the reverse is true for lower testosterone. \nThe results of the study may have implications for hedge-fund performance as well as hedge fund culture, which tends to prize aggression, competitiveness and drive. \nIf this study is true, perhaps the prevalence of alpha males is what’s eroding alpha.
