    "text": "GENEVA/ADEN (Reuters) - The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said on Saturday one of its employees had been killed in a shooting in the Yemeni city of Taiz.\nFILE PHOTO: Journalists look at an ICRC (The International Committee of the Red Cross) car in which an ICRC employee was fatally shot in Taiz, Yemen April 21, 2018. REUTERS/Stringer It made the announcement on its twitter feed, and said it was trying to find out more information about the incident.\nYemeni officials and the ICRC named the man as Hanna Lahoud, a Lebanese national, who was killed in Taiz in southwestern Yemen by unknown gunmen who opened fire on a car.\nLahoud was in charge of the ICRCâ€™s detention program in Yemen, the ICRC said in a statement. He was on his way to visit a prison this morning when he was attacked on the outskirts of Taiz, the statement said. He was taken to hospital and died from his injuries.\nA Saudi-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting Iran-allied Houthi rebels.\nIran has denied supplying weapons to the Houthis. The war has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced more than two million and driven the country to the verge of famine.\nReporting by Tom Miles and Mohammed Ghobari; Writing by Hadeel Al Sayegh; Editing by Ros Russell\n ",
