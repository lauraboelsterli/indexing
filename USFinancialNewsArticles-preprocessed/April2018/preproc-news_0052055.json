    "text": "April 28, 2018 / 11:11 AM / Updated 32 minutes ago Spain's Otaegui shares lead with Wallace in China Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Spain’s Adrian Otaegui shot a five-under 67 in the China Open third round to join England’s overnight leader Matt Wallace with a one-stroke advantage atop the leaderboard on Saturday.\nOtaegui, winner of the Paul Lawrie Match Play event last year, had five straight birdies from the eighth to reach a total of 12-under at Beijing’s Topwin Golf and Country Club.\n“I played well from the beginning to the end,” Otaegui said. “I made a couple of mistakes but was able to make pars. Those five birdies in a row helped me a lot.\n“I think I have been very consistent all week. I am striking the ball well and feeling well so I am happy with that.”\nWallace, who was ahead for much of the round, dropped a shot at the 17th and had to settle for 69 and a share of the lead.\n“I had a chance at par at 17 and missed it and then it was just a bad tee shot down the last,” Wallace said.\n“Again it was frustrating but I’m playing really good golf so there’s not much else I can do.”\nSweden’s Alexander Bjork, France’s Julien Guerrier and Spain’s Jorge Campillo, who are all chasing a maiden victory on the European Tour, were in joint second place.
