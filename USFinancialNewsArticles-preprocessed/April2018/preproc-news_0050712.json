    "text": "0 COMMENTS Assemblywoman Shelley Mayer won a Westchester Senate seat Tuesday, giving Democrats a one-person majority in New York’s Senate—but Republicans will still control of the chamber.\nAlthough Ms. Mayer gives the Democrats a razor-thin numerical majority, Democratic Sen. Simcha Felder of Brooklyn caucuses with Republicans. On Tuesday, he said he would stick with the GOP but might reconsider before a new session starts in January 2019.\n“This issue is best resolved outside of the legislative session,” he said.\nIn her victory statement Tuesday night, Ms. Mayer stressed that the Democrats will have a numerical majority, despite Mr. Felder’s decision. “This race was about finally bringing a Democratic majority to the state Senate so that New York can once again be a progressive leader,” she said.\nThe Senate is key for both parties in Albany. Democrats hold the governor’s office and a vast majority in the Assembly, so if they win the Senate in November it would give them a coveted trifecta of power. For Republicans, the chamber is the party’s last bastion of power in New York.\nA group of eight other Democrats known as the Independent Democratic Conference had been allied with Republicans, but the group decided to return to the Democrats’ side earlier this month amid political pressure.\nMs. Mayer, a 65-year-old attorney, has represented Yonkers in the Assembly since winning a 2012 special election. She defeated Republican Julie Killian, 57, who served on the Rye City Council for almost six years and is chairwoman of Rye Action for Children and Teens, a drug- and alcohol-prevention organization.\n“Despite going up against political history and voter enrollment, our candidate ran a strong race,” said Senate GOP spokesman Scott Reif. “There are a number of Democrat-held seats that present better opportunities for us in November.”\nThe seat was vacated in late 2017 by Democrat George Latimer, a state senator who defeated incumbent Republican Rob Astorino to become Westchester County executive. Democrats have framed Mr. Latimer’s win—and now Ms. Mayer’s—as part of a streak they are hoping will give them control of the U.S. Congress in this year’s midterm elections.\n“These electoral wins are part of the blue wave sweeping our state and nation which will help even more Senate Democratic candidates win in the upcoming general election,” said Senate Democratic conference leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins on Tuesday.\nDemocrats already had an advantage for the Senate seat. They outnumber Republicans by about 30,000 registered voters in the Westchester district, which includes Yonkers, Rye, Mamaroneck, Port Chester and Bedford.\nRepublicans and political fundraising groups that support real-estate development and charter schools poured money into the race to block Democrats from gaining full control in Albany. State Democrats and labor groups did the same to support Ms. Mayer.\nSuki van Dijk, a Rye resident who voted and volunteered for Ms. Mayer, said she supported Ms. Mayer’s positions on gun control and abortion, as well as the candidate’s endorsement of a measure to extend the statute of limitations for victims of child sex abuse that Republicans oppose.\nHer polling place was crowded, she added: “It looked more like during presidential years.”\nThe district is one of two New York Senate seats that were up for grabs Tuesday in special elections. Democratic Assemblyman Luis Sepulveda won the other race for a vacant seat in Bronx County, where Democrats hold a vast registration advantage.\n—Kate King contributed to this article.\nWrite to Mike Vilensky at mike.vilensky@dowjones.com",
