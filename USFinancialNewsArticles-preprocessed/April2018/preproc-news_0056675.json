Surpassed the half-billion loan origination mark with loan originations of $91.3 million (US) for the year. Increased interest revenue of 8.1% to $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 vs 2016. Reduced operating costs (excluding non-recurring costs) by 20.3% to $9.0 million for the year ended 2017. Raised $3.5 million via a private placement.\nMONTREAL, April 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - IOU FINANCIAL INC. (\"IOU\" or \"the Company\") (TSXV: IOU), a leading online lender to small businesses ( IOUFinancial.com ), announced today its results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\"Our action plan in 2017 which consisted of rightsizing the organization, managing defaults and improved pricing has resulted in positive adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and represents a significant milestone for the organization. We expect to grow adjusted earnings throughout 2018,\" said Phil Marleau, CEO.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nLoan originations for the year ended December 31, 2017 were US$91.3 million versus originations of US$107.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Loan originations decreased due to changes made to the Company's lending policies in response to increased delinquency levels. However, loan origination growth resumed in Q4 and increased 17.5% to $23.5 million compared to the same period last year. As of December 31, 2017, IOU's total loans under management amounted to approximately $61.7 million as compared to $70.3 million at the end of year 2016. On December 31, 2017, the principal balance of the loan portfolio amounted to $33.0 million compared to $42.1 million in 2016. The principal balance of IOU's servicing portfolio (loans being serviced on behalf of third-parties) amounted to approximately $28.6 million compared to $28.2 million in 2016. IOU recorded gross revenue during the for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $17.4 million versus $17.4 million for the same period last year. Interest revenue increased 8.1% to 14.4 million for the year ended 2017 compared to the same period last year. The increase is attributable to an increase in the average commercial loan receivable balance and the Company's pricing structure. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased to $3.7 million, up from $3.2 million over the previous year. The increase is attributable to an increase in borrowings under the credit facility partially offset by a reduction in the cost of funds borrowed versus the previous year. Allowance for loan losses (net of recoveries) increased to $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, up from $7.3 million for the previous year. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in defaults by borrowers and, as a result, IOU Financial made changes to its lending policies. In addition, the Company implemented certain process changes to improve its servicing and collections which includes an aggressive litigation process against businesses who intentionally default on their loan obligations. As a result of these changes, the allowance for loan losses decreased 53% to $1.5 million in the fourth quarter 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Excluding non-recurring costs, operating expenses decreased 20.3% to $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $11.3 million for the previous year. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company adopted a plan to reduce operating expenses. The Company achieved its target of quarterly operating costs of $2.0 million to $2.2 million on a normalized basis in the third quarter. Operating costs, excluding non-recurring costs, were further reduced to $1.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, representing a decrease of 28.2% compared to the same period in 2016. The Company anticipates average quarterly operating expenses of approximately $1.6 million on a normalized basis in 2018. IOU closed on the year ended December 31, 2017 with a net loss of $4.5 million, or $0.05 per share, compared to a net loss of $4.8 million, or $0.08 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. IOU closed on the year ended December 31, 2017 with an adjusted net loss of $3.1 million, which excludes certain non-cash and non-recurring items, compared to an adjusted net loss of $3.2 million during the same period in 2016. In the fourth quarter 2017, IOU attained $0.1 million of adjusted earnings compared to an adjusted net loss of $1.4 million during the same period in 2016.\nOUTLOOK\nIOU remains well placed at the forefront of the fintech revolution that is democratizing access to capital for small businesses.
