    "text": "April 26 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc reported a 43 percent jump in first-quarter revenue on Thursday, driven by a surge in online shopping and higher demand for its cloud services.\nAmazon, which reported it had over 100 million Prime subscribers last week, said its net sales rose to $51.04 billion from $35.7 billion, a year earlier.\nNet income rose to $1.63 billion, or $3.27 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31 from $724 million, or $1.48 per share, a year earlier.\nRevenue from Amazon Web Services (AWS), the companyâ€™s fast-growing cloud services business, soared 48.6 percent to $5.44 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $5.25 billion, according Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
