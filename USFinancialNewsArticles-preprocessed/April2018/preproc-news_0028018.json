    "text": "FRESNO, Calif., April 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Communities First Financial Corporation (the “Company”) (OTCQX:CFST), the parent company of Fresno First Bank (the “Bank”), today announced solid profits for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Net income was $1.5 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018, up 75% from $837,000, or $0.29 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $877,000, or $0.30 per diluted share, which included a reassessment of the deferred tax asset of $331,000, or $0.11 per share, related to the tax reforms enacted at year end.\n“The team executed well in the first quarter of 2018, fueled by strong year-over-year loan and deposit growth, solid revenues, and an expanding net interest margin,” said Steve Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer. “It was important for us to start 2018 by developing great momentum in our core business lines. We continued to expand our presence in Central California generating new business relationships focused on business checking accounts, merchant services and quality loans. Deposit growth in the first quarter was a nice surprise and offset the typical seasonal deposit run-off. In fact, our non-interest-bearing deposits increased 22% from the like quarter a year ago.” Total deposits increased 17%, while total loans grew 10%, year-over-year.\n“The local economy in the valley continues to strengthen, spurred on by tax reform, infrastructure projects and new business formation. We remain focused on expanding our franchise here in the valley and will continue to look for opportunities to grow while adding long-term value for our shareholders,” added Miller.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights (as of, or for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, except where noted):\nDiluted earnings per share was $0.50 for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $0.29 for the first quarter of 2017. After adjusting for the DTA expense of $0.11 per share, diluted EPS was $0.30 for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nPre-tax income was $2.0 million, up 43% from $1.4 million for the first quarter of 2017. Pre-tax earnings were slightly lower on a linked quarter basis.\nReturn on average assets (“ROAA”) was 1.46%, compared to 0.97% for the first quarter a year ago.\nReturn on average equity (“ROAE”) was 16.80%, compared to 11.12% for the first quarter of 2017.\nNet interest income, after provision for loan losses, increased 21% to $4.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $3.4 million for the first quarter a year ago, and grew 7% from $3.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. No provision for loan losses was taken in the first quarter of 2018 or the preceding quarter, compared to a provision for loan losses of $80,000 booked in the first quarter of 2017.\nNet interest margin (“NIM”) expanded 19 basis points to 4.26%, compared to 4.07% for the first quarter a year ago, and improved 29 basis points from 3.97% from the fourth quarter of 2017.\nTotal deposits grew 17% to $372.6 million from $319.2 million a year earlier.\nTotal loans increased 10% to $269.8 million compared to $245.1 million a year ago.\nThe efficiency ratio improved to 56.17% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 61.53% for the first quarter a year earlier.\nNonperforming loans, as a percentage of total loans, were 1.09%. Asset quality remained sound with total nonperforming assets representing only 0.71% of total assets.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses (“ALLL”) was 1.25% as a percentage of total loans, at March 31, 2018, compared to 1.21% a year earlier. The ALLL as a percentage of total nonperforming loans was 114.81%.\nCapital ratios remain strong with a ratio of tangible shareholders’ equity to total assets of 8.71% at March 31, 2018, compared to 8.95% at March 31, 2017.\nResults of Operations\nNet interest income, after the provision for loan losses, increased 21% to $4.1 million from $3.4 million in the first quarter a year ago, primarily reflecting strong year-over-year loan growth. No provision for loan losses was booked in the current or preceding quarter and a provision of $80,000 was recorded in the first quarter of 2017. Net interest income increased 7% from $3.8 million in the preceding quarter.\nNon-interest income was $406,000 for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $313,000 for the first quarter of 2017, and $410,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017. “We strategically decided not to sell any loans during the current quarter and consequently gain on sale of loans was flat on a linked quarter basis but improved by 29% year-over-year,” said Steve Canfield, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Debit/credit card interchange income was up 24% and merchant services income also increased 19% year-over-year on higher volumes.\nThe net interest margin improved to 4.26% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 4.07% a year earlier, and 3.97% for the fourth quarter of 2017. “The recent increases in the Fed Funds and Prime rates have increased yields on our earning assets while at the same time our cost of funds has remained low,” stated Canfield. The net interest margin continues to remain well above the average of 3.64% generated by the SNL MicroCap U.S. Bank Index at December 31, 2017.\nOperating expenses totaled $2.5 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $2.3 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $2.2 million on a linked quarter basis. The increase in noninterest expense, from a year ago, primarily relates to changes in accrual rates for incentive programs and associated taxes at the beginning of the year, as well as well as higher occupancy expense from the lease of office space adjacent to the current headquarters.\nThe efficiency ratio was 56.17% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 61.53% a year ago, and 52.23% for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nBalance Sheet Review\nTotal assets grew 16% to $409.8 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $352.0 million at March 31, 2017 and increased 1% from $407.4 million at December 31, 2017.\nTotal loans increased 10% to $269.8 million at March 31, 2018, from $245.1 million a year ago, and increased 2% from $263.9 million on a linked quarter basis.\nThe commercial and industrial (C&I) portfolio totaled $140.4 million, representing 52% of total loans at March 31, 2018. Commercial real estate (CRE) loans totaled $78.1 million, or 29% of total loans. Agriculture and land loans totaled $21.7 million, representing 8% of loans; residential home loans were $11.1 million, or 5% of loans, and real estate construction and land development loans were $18.4 million, or 7% of loans. At March 31, 2018, $88.0 million or 32.6% of the loan portfolio was guaranteed by the SBA, USDA or other government agencies.\nTotal deposits increased 17% to $372.6 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $319.2 million from a year earlier and remained flat from $371.4 million at December 31, 2017. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits grew by 22% to $216.3 million at March 31, 2018, representing 58% of total deposits, compared to $177.1 million, or 55% of total deposits a year ago. The ratio of loans to deposits was 72.41% at March 31, 2018, compared to 76.79% one year earlier and 71.05% at December 31, 2017.\nNet shareholder’s equity increased to $35.7 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $31.5 million a year ago. Book value per common share increased to $12.50 at March 31, 2018, compared to $11.18 a year ago .\nAsset Quality\nNonperforming assets (“NPAs”) totaled $2.9 million at both March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, compared to zero NPAs one year earlier. “The NPAs are related to a series of loans isolated to one borrower, which are well-secured with good collateral,” added Miller.\nLoans delinquent 30 to 60 days totaled $1.3 million, and consist of two loans. One is a USDA loan purchased from a Midwest bank in the amount of $1.25 million, which is 100% government guaranteed. “The loan was late for its annual payment and is expected to be brought current by the end of the second quarter. In the meantime, we continue to earn interest on the entire balance,” said Miller.\nWith ample reserves, there was no provision for loan losses booked for the current quarter or the preceding quarter, compared to a provision of $80,000 taken in the first quarter of 2016. There was a recovery of $1,000 in the first quarter of 2018, compared to net charge-offs of $1,000 a year ago. The allowance for loan losses to total loans ratio was 1.25% at March 31, 2018, compared to 1.21% a year earlier and 1.27% at December 31, 2017.\nAbout Communities First Financial Corporation\nCommunities First Financial Corporation, a bank holding company established in 2014, is the parent company of Fresno First Bank, founded in 2005 in Fresno, California.
