This action is pending in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.\nGet Help\nCelgene investors should visit us at https://www.claimsfiler.com/cases/view-celgene-corporation-securities-litigation or call to speak to our claim center toll-free at (844) 367-9658.\nAbout the Lawsuit\nCelgene and certain of its executives are charged with failing to disclose material information during the Class Period, violating federal securities laws.\nOn October 19, 2017, the Company disclosed that it was discontinuing trials of its long-touted drug GED-0301 and recording a $1.6 billion impairment charge due to the drug's failure. Then, on February 27, 2018, the Company revealed that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had issued a refusal-to-file letter rejecting the New Drug Application (\"NDA\") for Ozanimod, another of its leading drug candidates, because \"the nonclinical and clinical pharmacology sections in the NDA were insufficient to permit a complete review.\"\nOn this news, the price of Celgene's shares plummeted.\nAbout ClaimsFiler\nClaimsFiler has a single mission: to serve as the information source to help retail investors recover their share of billions of dollars from securities class action settlements.
