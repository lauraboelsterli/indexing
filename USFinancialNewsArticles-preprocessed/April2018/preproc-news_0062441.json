Through efforts of many parties, we successfully transitioned from our apparel business and became a microfinance lender in Hubei Province. Listing on the NYSE American is only the first step, just the seed of our growth story. Dunxin Financial achieved a total loan size of RMB0.8 billion in 2017, a year-on-year growth of 17.4%. We believe that we will continue this momentum in 2018, we will continue to strengthen the brand effect in Wuhan, Hubei province, consolidate the market leading position and expand our service area. We believe that although China's microfinance market has experienced 8 years of development, it is still at an early stage of development, providing us with many opportunities for healthy organic growth, new business expansion and selective acquisitions. With the growing intensity of industry competition, consolidation opportunities in the industry will grow rapidly. Thanks to Hubei Province high GDP growth rate, which is above the national GDP growth, the national 'belt and road initiative' and the impact of the NYSE listing on our brand, we firmly believe in our long-term sustainable growth.\"\n2017 Financial Results\nInterest income on loans\nThe interest income on loans increased by RMB31.9 million ($4.9 million), or 38.0%, from RMB83.9 million in 2016 to RMB115.8 million ($17.8 million) in 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in outstanding loans during the year from RMB930.2 million in 2016 to RMB1,094.2 million ($168.2 million) in 2017, which resulted in a RMB16.4 million ($2.5 million) increase in interest income on loans. Also, the increase was attributable to the increase in average interest rate from 19.8% in 2016 to 21.6% in 2017, which resulted in a RMB8.8 million ($1.4 million). Additionally, the increase in average loan duration from approximately 164 days in 2016 to approximately 176 days in 2017, which resulted in a RMB6.7 million ($1.0 million) increase in interest income on loans.\nFees on loans\nThe fees on loans decreased by RMB17.1 million ($2.6 million), or 81.4%, from RMB21.0 million in 2016 to RMB3.9 million ($0.6 million) in 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in loans subject to fees charged from RMB446.3 million in 2016 to RMB169.4 million ($26.0 million) in 2017, which resulted in a RMB9.7 million ($1.5 million) decrease in fees on loans. Also, the decrease in average loan duration from approximately 174 days in 2016 to approximately 86 days in 2017, which resulted in a RMB7.4 million ($1.1 million) decrease in fees on loans.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased by RMB15.9 million ($2.4 million), or 71.6%, from RMB22.2 million in 2016 to RMB38.1 million ($5.9 million) in 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in borrowings during the year from RMB535.5 million in 2016 to RMB616.8 million ($94.8 million), which resulted in a RMB5.0 million ($0.8 million) increase in interest expense on borrowings. Also, the increase in the average duration of the borrowings from approximately 118 days in 2016 to approximately 199 days in 2017, which resulted in a RMB15.6 million ($2.4 million) increase in interest expense on borrowings. The increase was partially offset by average interest rate on borrowings from 12.6% in 2016 to 11.2% in 2017, which resulted in a RMB4.7 million ($0.7 million) decrease in interest expense on borrowings.\nBusiness related taxes and surcharges\nBusiness related taxes and surcharges decreased by RMB0.5 million ($0.1 million), or 41.7%, from RMB1.2 million in 2016 to RMB0.7 million ($0.1 million) in 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to the tax reform implemented since May 1, 2016, whereby business taxes of 6% were changed to value added taxes of 6%. Business taxes are reported as a deduction to revenue when incurred. Entities that are value added taxes taxpayers are allowed to offset qualified input value added taxes paid to suppliers against their output value added taxes liabilities. Net value added taxes balance between input value added taxes and output value added taxes are recorded either in the line item of accrued expenses or other liabilities on the face of balance sheet.\nAllowance for loan losses\nAllowance for loan losses decreased by RMB2.8 million ($0.4 million), or 43.8%, from RMB6.4 million in 2016 to RMB3.6 million ($0.6 million) in 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to the lesser allowance required to achieve the rate of allowance similar to last year.\nOther interest and other income\nOther interest and other income decreased by RMB1.0 million ($0.2 million), or 55.6%, from RMB1.8 million in 2016 to RMB0.8 million ($0.1 million) in 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to the redemption of principal guaranteed investment products in 2016, as there was no such investment in 2017.\nSales and marketing expenses\nSales and marketing expenses decreased by RMB1.8 million ($0.3 million), or 36.7%, from RMB4.9 million in 2016 to RMB3.1 million ($0.5 million) in 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to the reduction of marketing expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by RMB11.8 million ($1.8 million), or 79.2%, from RMB14.9 million in 2016 to RMB26.7 million ($4.1 million) in 2017. The increase was primarily due to the increase in legal, consulting and professional expenses for the listing initiative.\nIncome tax expenses\nThe income tax expenses decreased by RMB0.6 million ($0.1 million), or 3.9%, from RMB15.2 million in 2016 to RMB14.6 million ($2.2 million) in 2017. The decrease was primarily attributed to lower income before taxation in 2017 as compared to 2016.\nNet income\nAs a result of the foregoing, net income decreased by RMB8.3 million ($1.3 million), or 19.8%, from RMB41.9 million in 2016 to RMB33.6 million ($5.2 million) in 2017.\nEarnings per ADS\nEarnings per ADS were $1.05 in 2017, as compared to earnings per ADS of $1.27 in 2016.\nFinancial Position\nAs of December 31, 2017, the size of the Company loan portfolio was RMB818.1 million ($125.7 million), a year-on-year growth of 17.4%.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call and live webcast at 8 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (EDT) on April 30, 2018, (8 p.m. Beijing time on the same day).\nThe toll free dial-in details for the live conference call are as follows:\nUSA: 1866-836-0101 China: 800-803-6015, 400-603-9015 Hong Kong: 800-968-966 International access: +886-2-2192-8018 Participant PIN Code: 588998 #\nA telephone replay of the call will be available 2 hours after the end of the conference through May 30, 2018 at 8 a.m. EDT.\nConference playback number: +886-2-2192-8015\nEnter conference playback reference number: 204589#\nEnter participant pin code: 652712#\nAccessible Duration: 30 Days\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined in the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
