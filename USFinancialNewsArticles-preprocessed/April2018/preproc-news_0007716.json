    "text": "EditorsNote: adds “in regulation” in fifth graf; fixes “Puljujarvi” in last graf\nConnor McDavid had three assists to increase his league-leading points total to 106, and Ty Rattie had a goal and an assist as the Edmonton Oilers scored three unanswered third period goals to pull out a 4-3 victory over the visiting Vegas Golden Knights on Thursday night.\nMichael Cammalleri, Matt Benning and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins also scored goals for Edmonton (35-40-6, 76 points), which snapped a five-game losing streak and won the regular-season series with the Golden Knights, 3-1.\nOilers goalie Cam Talbot finished with 30 saves.\nOscar Lindberg, Brandon Pirri and Brayden McNabb scored for Pacific Division champion Vegas (51-23-7, 109), which had a three-game winning streak snapped. The Golden Knights once again rested regulars Marc-Andre Fleury, Jonathan Marchessault, David Perron, Nate Schmidt and Reilly Smith in preparation for next week’s Stanley Cup playoffs.\nMalcolm Subban had 29 saves in losing for just the fourth time (13-4-2) this season. Vegas, which lost in regulation for the first time in its last seven road contests (4-1-2), finishes the regular season on Saturday night at Calgary.\nEdmonton, which handed the Golden Knights their worst road loss of the year, 8-2, on Nov. 14, took a 1-0 lead in the first period when Nugent-Hopkins, left alone at the right of the net, one-timed a crossing pass from Rattie for his 23rd goal of the season.\nVegas bounced back to take a 2-1 lead in the second period with two goals in less than three minutes. McNabb got the first when he got the puck at the top of the right circle and skated unobstructed to the net where he snapped a wrist shot past Talbot for his fifth goal of the season.\nPirri followed with his third goal in five periods since being recalled from Chicago of the AHL on Tuesday, finishing an odd-man rush with Alex Tuch with a wrist shot past Talbot’s glove side.\nBenning tied it early in the third period when he beat Subban with a wrist shot from the top of the slot for his sixth goal of the season. Cammalleri then gave the Oilers a 3-2 lead with a power-play goal just seconds after Vegas center Ryan Carpenter hit the post in an attempt for a short-handed goal. Rattie followed with his fifth goal of the season off a pass from McDavid to extended Edmonton’s lead to 4-2.\nLindberg cut it to 4-3 with his ninth goal with 5:23 to go.\nVegas pulled Subban and had a six-on-four power play when Jesse Puljujarvi was called for tripping with 1:48 to go, but Talbot was up to the challenge and made three saves down the stretch, including one on a tip-in try by James Neal.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
