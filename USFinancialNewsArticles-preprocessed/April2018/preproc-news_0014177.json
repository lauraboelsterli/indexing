    "text": "SAN DIEGO, April 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Trucept Inc. (OTC Pink: TREP) Trucept Inc. has published its annual report for 2017. The Company earned a net profit of approximately $602,438 for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ending December 31, 2017 and 2016, revenues were $8,030,555 and $6,738,432 respectively, for an increase of $1,292,123 (19.2%) over the same period in 2016.\nEffective December 27, 2017 Trucept became the marketing arm of several nationally known Professional Employer Organizations. Trucept facilitates the sales for these PEOs and spun off its current payroll team while retaining its customer service platform. These moves allowed Trucept to leverage its extensive client contacts. Current Trucept clients will continue to be serviced by their familiar customer service associates.\nSafe Harbor:\nStatements in this press release that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding future revenues and sales projections, plans for future financing, the ability to meet operational milestones, marketing arrangements and plans, and shipments to and regulatory approvals in international markets.

Actual results, events, or performance may differ materially from the above forward-looking statements due to a number of important factors, and will be dependent upon a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to obtain additional financing that will allow us to continue our current and future operations and whether demand for our products and services in domestic and international markets will continue to expand. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date hereof or to reflect any change in the Company's expectations with regard to these forward-looking statements or the occurrence of unanticipated events.
