    "text": "April 23, 2018 / 5:43 AM / Updated 16 minutes ago Australia's Myer names ex-House of Fraser head as new CEO; shares jump Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Australia’s Myer Holdings ( MYR.AX ) has hired John King, a former head of British retailer House of Fraser, as its new chief executive as the nation’s biggest department store struggles against Amazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ) and other online competitors. A customer is seen inside a retail store for Australia's Myer Holdings Ltd's in central Sydney, Australia, February 19, 2018. REUTERS/David Gray \nShares of Myer were up about 5.6 percent on Monday after the announcement, compared to a 0.3 percent rise in the wider market . \nKing’s hiring comes two months after Myer announced the unexpected departure of its last chief executive, Richard Umbers, and a month after it posted its biggest half yearly loss since listing. \nUmbers had stepped down in February amid calls for a revamp of the company’s board from several shareholders, including from billionaire retail investor Solomon Lew. \nOnce a retail heavyweight in the world’s 12th largest economy, Myer has seen its market capitalisation shrink to less than a tenth of its 2009 listing value as it struggles to attract customers amid an explosion in online sales. \nThe 118-year old retailer’s woes have grown after \nAmazon.com made its first foray into Australia last year. \nThe S&P Dow Jones Indices has also excluded Myer from the benchmark Australian Index since last month.
