    "text": "GREENEVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Forward Air Corporation (NASDAQ:FWRD) today reported operating revenue, income from operations, net income and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nOperating revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased 15.5% to $302.6 million from $262.0 million for the same quarter in 2017. Income from operations was $24.2 million, compared to $23.7 million in the prior year quarter. Net income during the period was $17.7 million compared to $14.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net income per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.60 compared to $0.48 in the prior year quarter.\nBruce A. Campbell, President, and CEO, commenting on first quarter results said, “Our first quarter results were ahead of our guidance despite some adverse weather. Expedited LTL drove strong volume growth amid a tight Truckload market to deliver solid performance despite a higher use of brokered transportation. Truckload Premium Services also faced a higher use of brokered transportation as it continued adjusting its customer contracts to market rates. Our Intermodal group delivered broad-based growth that extended beyond its recently completed acquisitions. Pool Distribution had a solid quarter driven by volume growth and new business wins.”\nCommenting on the Company’s second quarter 2018 guidance, Michael J. Morris, Senior Vice President and CFO, said, “We expect second quarter year-on-year revenue growth to be 16% to 20%. This revenue outlook contemplates our 2018 implementation of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which now requires that we report fuel surcharge revenue on a gross basis. As such, our growth outlook reflects a comparison to our second quarter 2017 revenue which reported fuel surcharge on a net basis. After adjusting this prior year period to reflect fuel surcharge revenue on a gross basis, we expect our year-on-year revenue growth to be 9% to 13%. We expect net income per diluted share to be between $0.73 and $0.77 in the second quarter of 2018, compared to $0.65 in the prior year quarter. The prior year earnings per share for the second quarter of 2017 increased $0.01 per diluted share from the originally reported $0.64 per diluted share following the implementation of ASC 606.”\nOn April 20, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share of common stock. The dividend is payable to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 25, 2018, and is expected to be paid on June 8, 2018.\nThis quarterly dividend is pursuant to a cash dividend policy approved by the Board of Directors, which anticipates a total annual dividend of $0.60 per share of common stock, payable in quarterly increments of $0.15 per share of common stock. The actual declaration of future cash dividends, and the establishment of record and payment dates, is subject to final determination by the Board of Directors each quarter after its review of the Company's financial performance.\nReview of Financial Results\nForward Air will hold a conference call to discuss first quarter 2018 results on Thursday, April 26, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. EDT. The Company’s conference call will be available online at www.forwardaircorp.com or by dialing (800) 398-9379. A replay of the conference call will be available at www.forwardaircorp.com beginning shortly after the completion of the live call.\nAbout Forward Air Corporation\nForward Air keeps your business moving forward by providing services within four business segments: Expedited LTL (provides expedited regional, inter-regional and national LTL services, including local pick-up and delivery, shipment consolidation/deconsolidation, warehousing, and customs brokerage by utilizing a comprehensive national network of terminals); Truckload Premium Services (provides expedited truckload brokerage, dedicated fleet services, as well as high-security and temperature-controlled logistics services); Intermodal (provides first-and last-mile high-value drayage services both to and from seaports and railheads, dedicated contract and Container Freight Station warehouse and handling services); and Pool Distribution (provides high-frequency handling and distribution of time sensitive product to numerous destinations within a specific geographic region).

Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as:“anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “seek,” “believe,” “project,” “estimate,” “expect,” “strategy,” “future,”“likely,” “may,” “should,” “will” and similar references to future periods. Forward-looking statements included in this press release relate to expected second quarter 2018 revenue growth and net income per diluted shares as well as full year 2018 projected tax rate, fully diluted share count (before consideration of future share repurchase) and projected capital expenditures.\nForward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. The following is a list of factors, among others, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements: economic factors such as recessions, inflation, higher interest rates and downturns in customer business cycles, the creditworthiness of our customers and their ability to pay for services rendered, the availability and compensation of qualified independent owner-operators and freight handlers as well as contracted, third-party carriers needed to serve our customers’ transportation needs, the inability of our information systems to handle an increased volume of freight moving through our network, changes in fuel prices, our inability to maintain our historical growth rate because of a decreased volume of freight or decreased average revenue per pound of freight moving through our network, loss of a major customer, increasing competition and pricing pressure, our ability to secure terminal facilities in desirable locations at reasonable rates, our inability to successfully integrate acquisitions, claims for property damage, personal injuries or workers’ compensation, enforcement of and changes in governmental regulations, environmental and tax matters, insurance matters, the handling of hazardous materials and the risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nAny forward-looking statement made by us in this press release is based only on information currently available to us and speaks only as of the date on which it is made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180425006602/en/\nForward Air Corporation\nMichael J.
