Weinberg, Executive Chairman\n\"Five experienced Advisory bankers committed to join Evercore during the first quarter, strengthening our ability to serve clients in targeted markets and sectors, including in Consumer / Retail, a strategic priority for many years. This is a strong start as we continue to invest for the future,\" said John S.

Altman, Founder and Senior Chairman\n\"We are fortunate to be involved in some of the largest and most complex transactions that are currently being considered by our clients, and we continue to experience a high level of dialogue and activity with clients as economic conditions continue to be supportive of high levels of M&A and capital advisory,\" said Roger C.

See the Business Line Reporting - Discussion of U.S. GAAP Results below for further information.\nThe Company adopted the new accounting standard, ASC 606, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" on January 1, 2018. The application of this standard did not result in significant changes to the Company's results; client related expenses for underwriting transactions are now presented gross (previously presented net) in related U.S. GAAP reported revenues and expenses.\nCompensation Ratio\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the compensation ratio was 59.4% versus 53.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2017, reflecting the elevated level of expense associated with the expected significant investment in Advisory talent in 2018, as well as elevated costs associated with recruiting senior talent in 2016 and 2017. The compensation ratio was also lower for the three months ended March 31, 2017 due to the expense reversal associated with acquisition-related LP Interests during the first quarter of 2017. See the Business Line Reporting - Discussion of U.S. GAAP Results below for further information.\nOperating Income\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, Operating Income of $112.5 million increased 1% versus the three months ended March 31, 2017, driven by an increase in Net Revenues, partially offset by increased compensation and non-compensation costs in the Investment Banking business. See the Business Line Reporting - Discussion of U.S. GAAP Results below for further information.\nEffective Tax Rate\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the effective tax rate was 4.3% versus 16.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nIn conjunction with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017, which reduced income tax rates in the U.S. in 2018 and future years, our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was reduced by 12 percentage points, before the impact of the application of the share-based compensation accounting standard, described below.\nThe provision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 includes a benefit of $21.9 million and $23.0 million, respectively, following the application of a new accounting standard, effective January 1, 2017, related to share-based compensation, which requires that the tax deduction associated with the appreciation in the Firm's share price upon vesting of employee share-based awards above the original grant price be reflected in income tax expense. This benefit resulted in a decrease in the effective tax rate of 19.1 and 20.3 percentage points for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe effective tax rate is also impacted by the non-deductible treatment of compensation associated with Evercore LP Units/Interests.\nNet Income and Earnings Per Share\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, Net Income Attributable to Evercore Inc. and Earnings Per Share of $95.5 million and $2.10, respectively, increased 18% and 19%, respectively, versus the three months ended March 31, 2017, principally driven by an increase in Net Revenues in the Investment Banking business and a decrease in the effective tax rate.\nSelected Financial Data - Adjusted Results:\nThe following is a discussion of Evercore's results on an Adjusted basis. See pages 7 and A-2 to A-11 for further information and reconciliations of these non-GAAP metrics to our U.S. GAAP results.\nAdjusted\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\n%\nChange\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nNet Revenues\n$\n460,492\n$\n384,739\n20%\nOperating Income\n$\n124,993\n$\n96,541\n29%\nNet Income Attributable to Evercore Inc.\n$\n113,784\n$\n83,640\n36%\nDiluted Earnings Per Share\n$\n2.24\n$\n1.61\n39%\nCompensation Ratio\n59.0%\n59.0%\nOperating Margin\n27.1%\n25.1%\nEffective Tax Rate\n6.3%\n10.9%\nTrailing Twelve Month Compensation Ratio\n58.5%\n57.6%\nAdjusted Net Revenues\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, Adjusted Net Revenues of $460.5 million increased 20% versus the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily driven by increases in Advisory Fees and Underwriting Fees. See the Business Line Reporting - Discussion of Adjusted Results below for further information.\nAdjusted Compensation Ratio\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Adjusted compensation ratio was 59.0%, flat compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, reflecting the elevated level of expense associated with the expected significant investment in Advisory talent in 2018, as well as elevated costs associated with recruiting senior talent in 2016 and 2017. See the Business Line Reporting - Discussion of Adjusted Results below for further information.\nAdjusted Operating Income\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, Adjusted Operating Income of $125.0 million increased 29% versus the three months ended March 31, 2017, driven by an increase in Net Revenues, partially offset by increased compensation and non-compensation costs in the Investment Banking business. See the Business Line Reporting - Discussion of Adjusted Results below for further information.\nAdjusted Effective Tax Rate\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Adjusted effective tax rate was 6.3% versus 10.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nIn conjunction with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017, which reduced income tax rates in the U.S. in 2018 and future years, our Adjusted effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was reduced by 13 percentage points, before the impact of the application of the share-based compensation accounting standard, described below.\nThe Adjusted effective tax rate includes a benefit of $22.8 million and $25.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, following the application of a new accounting standard, effective January 1, 2017, related to share-based compensation, which requires that the tax deduction associated with the appreciation in the Firm's share price upon vesting of employee share-based awards above the original grant price be reflected in income tax expense. This benefit resulted in a decrease in the Adjusted effective tax rate of 18.6 and 26.9 percentage points for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nChanges in the Adjusted effective tax rate are also driven by the level of earnings in businesses with minority owners.\nAdjusted Net Income and Earnings Per Share\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Evercore Inc. and Adjusted Earnings Per Share of $113.8 million and $2.24, respectively, increased 36% and 39%, respectively, versus the three months ended March 31, 2017, driven by an increase in Net Revenues in the Investment Banking business and a decrease in the effective tax rate, partially offset by increased compensation and non-compensation costs.\nEvercore's quarterly results may fluctuate significantly due to the timing and amount of transaction fees earned, as well as other factors. Accordingly, financial results in any particular quarter may not be representative of future results over a longer period of time.\nNon-GAAP Measures:\nThroughout this release certain information is presented on an Adjusted basis, which is a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted results begin with information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"), and then those results are adjusted to exclude certain items and reflect the conversion of vested and certain unvested Evercore LP Units and Interests into Class A shares. Evercore believes that the disclosed Adjusted measures and any adjustments thereto, when presented in conjunction with comparable U.S. GAAP measures, are useful to investors to compare Evercore's results across several periods and facilitate an understanding of Evercore's operating results. Evercore uses these measures to evaluate its operating performance, as well as the performance of individual employees. These measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nEvercore's Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Evercore Inc. for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was higher than U.S. GAAP as a result of the exclusion of expenses associated with awards granted in conjunction with certain of the Company's acquisitions, and certain other business acquisition-related charges and Special Charges.\nAcquisition-related compensation charges for 2018 include expenses associated with awards granted in conjunction with the Company's acquisition of ISI. Acquisition-related charges for 2018 also include professional fees incurred and amortization of intangible assets.\nSpecial Charges for 2018 relate to separation benefits and costs of terminating certain contracts associated with closing the agency trading platform in the U.K.\nIn addition, for Adjusted purposes, client related expenses have been presented as a reduction from Revenues and Non-compensation costs.\nEvercore's Adjusted Diluted Shares Outstanding for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were higher than U.S. GAAP as a result of the inclusion of certain Evercore LP Units.\nThis release also presents changes in Adjusted Investment Management Operating Income and Adjusted Investment Management Operating Margin from the prior-year periods assuming that the restructuring of certain Investment Management affiliates occurred on December 31, 2016. This includes the sale of the Institutional Trust and Independent Fiduciary business of ETC that occurred on October 18, 2017. Evercore believes this is useful additional information for investors because it improves the comparability of period-over-period results and aligns with management's view of business performance.\nFurther details of these adjustments, as well as an explanation of similar amounts for the three months ended March 31, 2017 are included in Annex I, pages A-2 to A-11.\nCertain balances in the prior period were reclassified to conform to their current presentation in this release. \"Investment Banking Revenue\" has been disaggregated into \"Advisory Fees,\" \"Underwriting Fees\" and \"Commissions and Related Fees\" and \"Investment Management Revenue\" has been renamed to \"Asset Management and Administration Fees.\" \"Other Revenue, Including Interest\" has been renamed to \"Other Revenue, Including Interest and Investments\" and principal trading gains and losses and realized and unrealized gains and losses on private equity investments have been reclassified from Investment Banking Revenue and Investment Management Revenue to \"Other Revenue, Including Interest and Investments.\"\nBusiness Line Reporting - Discussion of U.S. GAAP Results\nThe following is a discussion of Evercore's segment results on a U.S. GAAP basis.\nInvestment Banking\nU.S. GAAP\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\n%\nChange\n(dollars in thousands)\nNet Revenues:\nInvestment Banking:\nAdvisory Fees\n$\n378,315\n$\n312,284\n21%\nUnderwriting Fees (1)\n30,279\n9,980\n203%\nCommissions and Related Fees\n43,034\n49,684\n(13%)\nOther Revenue, net (2)\n(1,428)\n(1,178)\n(21%)\nNet Revenues\n450,200\n370,770\n21%\nExpenses:\nEmployee Compensation and Benefits\n267,539\n196,125\n36%\nNon-compensation Costs\n70,284\n66,488\n6%\nSpecial Charges\n1,897\n—\nNM\nTotal Expenses\n339,720\n262,613\n29%\nOperating Income\n$\n110,480\n$\n108,157\n2%\nCompensation Ratio\n59.4%\n52.9%\nNon-compensation Ratio\n15.6%\n17.9%\nOperating Margin\n24.5%\n29.2%\nAdvisory Client Transactions (3)\n201\n163\n23%\nAdvisory Fees in Excess of $1 million (3)\n63\n53\n19%\n(1) The application of the new revenue accounting standard resulted in client related expenses for underwriting transactions being presented gross in related revenues and expenses on a U.S. GAAP basis for the three months ended March 31, 2018.

Commissions and Related Fees for the three months ended March 31, 2018 decreased 13% from the first quarter of last year principally driven by the trend of institutional clients adjusting the level of payments for research services.\nExpenses\nCompensation costs were $267.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of 36% from the first quarter of last year. The compensation ratio was 59.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to 52.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2017, reflecting the elevated level of expense associated with the expected significant investment in Advisory talent in 2018, as well as elevated costs associated with recruiting senior talent in 2016 and 2017. The compensation ratio was also lower for the three months ended March 31, 2017 due to the expense reversal associated with acquisition-related LP Interests during the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-compensation costs for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $70.3 million, up 6% compared to the first quarter of last year. The increase in non-compensation costs versus last year reflects the addition of personnel and the inclusion of underwriting expenses.

The aggregate 1.4 million shares/units were acquired at an average price per share/unit of $97.94.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, as part of the 2017 bonus awards, the Company granted to certain employees approximately 1.8 million unvested RSUs at a grant date fair value of $94.35.

Adjusted results begin with information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"), adjusted to exclude certain items and reflect the conversion of vested and certain unvested Evercore LP Units and Interests, as well as Acquisition Related Share Issuances and Unvested Restricted Stock Units granted to ISI employees, into Class A shares. Evercore believes that the disclosed Adjusted measures and any adjustments thereto, when presented in conjunction with comparable U.S. GAAP measures, are useful to investors to compare Evercore's results across several periods and facilitate an understanding of Evercore's operating results. The Company uses these measures to evaluate its operating performance, as well as the performance of individual employees. These measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These Adjusted amounts are allocated to the Company's two business segments: Investment Banking and Investment Management. The differences between the Adjusted and U.S. GAAP results are as follows:\n1. Assumed Vesting of Evercore LP Units and Exchange into Class A Shares. The Company incurred expenses, in Employee Compensation and Benefits, resulting from the vesting of Class E LP Units issued in conjunction with the acquisition of ISI, as well as Class G and H LP Interests and Class J LP Units. The amount of expense or the reversal of expense for the Class G and H LP Interests is based on the determination if it is probable that Evercore ISI will achieve certain earnings and margin targets in 2017 and in future periods. The Adjusted results assume these LP Units and certain Class G and H LP Interests have vested and have been exchanged for Class A shares. Accordingly, any expense or reversal of expense associated with these units and interests, and related awards, is excluded from the Adjusted results, and the noncontrolling interest related to these units is converted to a controlling interest. The Company's Management believes that it is useful to provide the per-share effect associated with the assumed conversion of these previously granted equity interests, and thus the Adjusted results reflect the exchange of certain vested and unvested Evercore LP partnership units and interests and IPO related restricted stock unit awards into Class A shares.\n2. Adjustments Associated with Business Combinations and Divestitures. The following charges resulting from business combinations and divestitures have been excluded from the Adjusted results because the Company's Management believes that operating performance is more comparable across periods excluding the effects of these acquisition-related charges:\na. Amortization of Intangible Assets and Other Purchase Accounting-related Amortization. Amortization of intangible assets and other purchase accounting-related amortization from the acquisitions of ISI, SFS and certain other acquisitions.\nb. Acquisition and Transition Costs. Primarily professional fees incurred and costs related to transitioning acquisitions or divestitures.\nc. Gain on Transfer of Ownership of Mexican Private Equity Business. The gain resulting from the transfer of ownership of the Mexican Private Equity business in the third quarter of 2016 is excluded from the Adjusted Results.\nd. Gain on Sale of Institutional Trust and Independent Fiduciary business of ETC. The gain resulting from the sale of the Institutional Trust and Independent Fiduciary business of ETC in the fourth quarter of 2017 is excluded from the Adjusted Results.\ne. Foreign Exchange Gains / (Losses). Release of cumulative foreign exchange losses resulting from the restructuring of our equity method investment in G5 in the fourth quarter of 2017 are excluded from the Adjusted presentation.\n3. Client Related Expenses. Client related expenses, expenses associated with revenue sharing engagements with third parties and provisions for uncollected receivables have been classified as a reduction of revenue in the Adjusted presentation. The Company's Management believes that this adjustment results in more meaningful key operating ratios, such as compensation to net revenues and operating margin.\n4. Special Charges. Expenses during 2018 relate to separation benefits and costs of terminating certain contracts associated with closing the agency trading platform in the U.K.\n5. Income Taxes. Evercore is organized as a series of Limited Liability Companies, Partnerships, C-Corporations and a Public Corporation and therefore, not all of the Company's income is subject to corporate-level taxes. As a result, adjustments have been made to the Adjusted earnings to assume that the Company is subject to the statutory tax rates of a C-Corporation under a conventional corporate tax structure in the U.S. at the prevailing corporate rates and that all deferred tax assets relating to foreign operations are fully realizable within the structure on a consolidated basis. This assumption is consistent with the assumption that certain Evercore LP Units and Interests are vested and exchanged into Class A shares, as discussed in Item 1 above, as the assumed exchange would change the tax structure of the Company.\nExcluded from the Company's Adjusted results are adjustments related to the impact of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on December 22, 2017, which resulted in a reduction in income tax rates in the U.S. in future years. The tax reform resulted in an estimated adjustment to Other Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $77.5 million related to the re-measurement of amounts due pursuant to our tax receivable agreement, which was reduced due to the lower enacted income tax rates in the U.S. in future years.\n6. Presentation of Interest Expense. The Adjusted results present interest expense on short-term repurchase agreements, within the Investment Management segment, in Other Revenues, net, as the Company's Management believes it is more meaningful to present the spread on net interest resulting from the matched financial assets and liabilities. In addition, Adjusted Investment Banking and Investment Management Operating Income are presented before interest expense on debt, which is included in interest expense on a U.S. GAAP basis.\n7. Presentation of Income from Equity Method Investments. The Adjusted results present Income from Equity Method Investments within Revenue as the Company's Management believes it is a more meaningful presentation.\nThis release also presents changes in Adjusted Investment Management Operating Income and Adjusted Investment Management Operating Margin from the prior-year periods assuming that the restructuring of certain Investment Management affiliates occurred on December 31, 2016. This includes sale of the Institutional Trust and Independent Fiduciary business of ETC that occurred on October 18, 2017. Evercore believes this is useful additional information for investors because it improves the comparability of period-over-period results and aligns with management's view of business performance.\nEVERCORE INC.\nU.S. GAAP RECONCILIATION TO ADJUSTED RESULTS\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n(UNAUDITED)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\nNet Revenues

revenue sharing engagements with third parties and provisions for uncollected receivables have been reclassified as a reduction of Revenue in the Adjusted presentation.\n(2) Income (Loss) from Equity Method Investments has been reclassified to Revenue in the Adjusted presentation.\n(3) Interest Expense on Debt is excluded from the Adjusted Investment Banking and Investment Management segment

Interests and Class J LP Units issued in conjunction with the acquisition of ISI are excluded from the Adjusted presentation.\n(5) Expenses during 2018 relate to separation benefits and costs of terminating certain contracts associated with closing the agency trading platform in the U.K.\n(6) Non-compensation Costs on an Adjusted basis reflect the following adjustments:\nThree Months Ended

intangible assets and other purchase accounting-related amortization from the acquisitions of ISI, SFS and certain other acquisitions.\n(6b) Primarily professional fees incurred and costs related to transitioning acquisitions or divestitures.\n(7) Evercore is organized as a series of Limited Liability Companies, Partnerships, C-Corporations and a Public Corporation and therefore, not all of the Company's income is subject to corporate-level taxes. As a result, adjustments have been made to the Adjusted earnings to assume that the Company is subject to the statutory tax rates of a C-Corporation under a conventional corporate tax structure in the U.S. at the prevailing corporate rates and that all deferred tax assets relating to foreign operations are fully realizable within the structure on a consolidated basis. This assumption is consistent with the assumption that certain Evercore LP Units and Interests are vested and exchanged into Class A shares, as the assumed exchange would change the tax structure of the Company.\nExcluded from the Company's Adjusted results are adjustments related to the impact of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on December 22, 2017, which resulted in a reduction in income tax rates in the U.S. in future years. The tax reform also resulted in an estimated adjustment to Other Revenue of $77.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the re-measurement of amounts due pursuant to our tax receivable agreement, which was reduced due to the lower enacted income tax rates in the U.S. in future years.\n(8) Reflects an adjustment to eliminate noncontrolling interest related to all Evercore LP partnership units which are assumed to be converted to Class A common stock in the Adjusted presentation.\n(9) Assumes the vesting, and exchange into Class A shares, of certain Evercore LP partnership units and interests and IPO related restricted stock unit awards in the Adjusted presentation. In the computation of outstanding common stock equivalents for U.S. GAAP net income per share, the Evercore LP partnership units are anti-dilutive.\n(10) Assumes the sale of the Institutional Trust and Independent Fiduciary business of ETC had occurred as of the beginning of the prior period presented and reflects adjustments to eliminate revenue and expenses that were previously consolidated from the Institutional Trust and Independent Fiduciary business of ETC. Management believes this adjustment is useful to investors to compare Evercore's results across periods.\n(11) Reflects the impact of the application of ASU 2016-09, \"Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,\" which requires that excess tax benefits and deficiencies from the delivery of Class A common stock under share-based payment arrangements be recognized in the Company's Provision for Income Taxes rather than in Additional Paid-In-Capital under prior U.S. GAAP.\n(12) The gain resulting from the sale of the Institutional Trust and Independent Fiduciary business of ETC in the fourth quarter of 2017 is excluded from the Adjusted presentation.\n(13) Release of cumulative foreign exchange losses resulting from the restructuring of our equity method investment in G5 in the fourth quarter of 2017 are excluded from the Adjusted presentation.\n(14) The gain resulting from the transfer of ownership of the Mexican Private Equity business in the third quarter of 2016 is excluded from the Adjusted presentation.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/evercore-reports-record-first-quarter-2018-results-increases-quarterly-dividend-to-0-50-per-share-300635939.html\nSOURCE Evercore",
