    "text": "(Adds details on exports, output, background)\nMEXICO CITY, April 9 (Reuters) - Mexican auto exports rose 7.5 percent in March from the same month last year, while production fell 10.9 percent, auto industry group AMIA said on Monday.\nMexico exported 327,955 autos in March, up from 304,950 in the same month last year, AMIA said. Production fell to 331,109 units from 371,447 produced in March 2017.\nAMIA’s director general, Fausto Cuevas, attributed the fall in production to the Easter national holiday in Mexico.\nMexico is in the midst of fraught talks with the United States and Canada to redraw the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Discussions over so-called rules of origin in the auto sector are among the thorniest facing negotiators.\nEarlier Monday, Mexico’s economy minister said he saw an 80 percent chance of reaching a new NAFTA deal by the first week of May, but added that conditions were not right for a deal this week.\nAMIA said domestic car sales totaled 118,600 units in March, down 13.4 percent from the same month last year.\nGuillermo Rosales, deputy director of the Mexican association of automobile distributors, attributed the fall to the impact of higher inflation and interest rates on consumers.\nJust under 70 percent of exports went to the United States, with 6.9 percent headed to Canada, and 12 percent bound for Latin America, AMIA said.
