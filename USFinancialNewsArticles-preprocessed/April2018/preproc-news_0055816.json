    "text": "ENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, N.J., April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq:CNOB) (the “Company” or “ConnectOne”), parent company of ConnectOne Bank (the “Bank”), today reported net income of $4.3 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared with $10.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $11.9 million for the first quarter of 2017. Diluted earnings per share were $0.13 for the current quarter versus $0.33 earned in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $0.37 earned in the first quarter of 2017. Earnings for the first quarter 2018 included a $17.0 million pretax provision for loan losses related to the Bank’s New York City taxi medallion loan portfolio.\nAdjusted net income amounted to $17.1 million, or $0.53 earnings per share, for the first quarter of 2018; $16.3 million, or $0.51 earnings per share, for the fourth quarter of 2017; and $12.3 million, or $0.38 earnings per share, for the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income excludes taxi medallion after-tax charges of $13.4 million for the first quarter 2018, $0.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, and $1.5 million for the first quarter 2017. In addition, the first quarter of 2018 excludes $0.5 million of income tax benefit from ASU 2016-19, the fourth quarter of 2017 excludes a $5.6 million deferred tax asset (“DTA”) estimated valuation charge resulting from the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Act”), and the first quarter of 2017 excludes $1.1 million of after-tax net gains on sales of securities.\nFrank Sorrentino, ConnectOne’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer stated, “We are pleased to report continued strong operating performance in the first quarter of 2018 resulting in an adjusted return on average assets of 1.37% and an adjusted return on average tangible common equity of 16.4%. On a quarterly average basis, total loans for the 2018 first quarter increased by an annualized 15.1% sequentially from the 2017 fourth quarter, while average deposits increased by 7.0% on the same basis. Although sequential point-to-point loan and deposit growth was less than typical for ConnectOne due to a large volume of business booked at year-end, we remain on track to achieve strong deposit and loan growth during 2018. We continue to build upon our C&I origination capabilities demonstrated by more than 25% annualized sequential growth in average C&I loans in the 2018 first quarter and, combined with the previously announced $75 million subordinated debt issuance in January 2018, have made substantial headway in reducing our commercial real estate concentration as a percentage of regulatory capital to 509% at March 31, 2018 from 568% at year-end 2017. On the technology front, the implementation of nCino continues, effectively digitizing our loan onboarding process, enhancing our client service capabilities and client experience while also providing additional operating leverage. While our net interest margin in the quarter appeared to contract significantly on a sequential quarter basis, the decrease was primarily attributable to known events and non-recurring items including the early first quarter issuance of $75 million of subordinated debt and a decrease in yield related loan fees. As we continue to invest in our infrastructure and new team members, the efficiency ratio, which due to seasonal factors is typically higher in the first quarter of the year, temporarily increased to 42.5%. In comparison to the first quarter of 2017, the ratio showed an improvement from 44.0%, and still places our organization as one of the best in the industry.”\nMr. Sorrentino added, “Our growth plans include new office centers in Melville, Long Island, which opened in April 2018, and in the Astoria, Queens Market, which is projected to open in the second half of the year. We are pleased with the groundwork we're laying for the continued success of the business and, going forward, our loan and deposit pipeline remains very strong. We continue to project 2018 loan growth to be in the low to mid-teens and remain well positioned to produce strong, sustainable long-term growth.”\nOperating Results\nFully taxable equivalent net interest income for the first quarter of 2018 was $38.6 million, a decrease of $2.1 million, or 5.2%, from the fourth quarter of 2017, resulting from the effects of a lower day count and a 25 basis-points contraction in the net interest margin to 3.26% from 3.51%, partially offset by a 4.3% increase in average interest earning assets, primarily loans, to $4.8 billion in the first quarter 2018 from $4.6 billion in the fourth quarter 2017. Included in net interest income was accretion and amortization of purchase accounting adjustments of $0.2 million during the first quarter of 2018 and $1.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding these purchase accounting adjustments, the adjusted net interest margin was 3.24% in the first quarter of 2018, contracting by 18 basis-points from the fourth quarter of 2017 adjusted net interest margin of 3.42%. Contributing 9 basis-points to the margin contraction were the subordinated debt issuance and the change in the taxable equivalent adjustment, both of which were anticipated. The margin contraction also reflected approximately 6 basis-points of lower yield related fees which tend to fluctuate from quarter to quarter, with the remaining variance attributable to an increasingly competitive environment on both sides of the balance sheet negatively affecting both spreads and volumes of new business.\nFully taxable equivalent net interest income for the first quarter of 2018 increased by $4.7 million, or 13.7%, from the first quarter of 2017, resulting from an increase in average interest-earning assets of 18.4%, primarily loans, offset by a contraction in the net interest margin of 14 basis-points to 3.26% from 3.40%. Included in net interest income was accretion and amortization of purchase accounting adjustments of $0.2 million during the first quarter of 2018 and $0.6 million during the first quarter of 2017. Excluding these purchase accounting adjustments, the adjusted net interest margin was 3.24% in the first quarter of 2018, contracting by 9 basis-points from the first quarter of 2017 adjusted net interest margin of 3.33%. The decrease in the adjusted net interest margin was primarily attributable to the aforementioned long-term subordinated debt issuance, the change in the taxable equivalent adjustment due to the Tax Act, and increased deposit rates, partially offset by higher rates earned on loans.\nNoninterest income totaled $1.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $3.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Included in the $3.0 million for the first quarter of 2017 were net gains on sale of investment securities of $1.6 million. There were no net gains on sale of investment securities during the first quarter of 2018 or the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease from the prior sequential quarter was mainly attributable to a $0.5 million gain on sale of non-relationship multifamily loans that took place during the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease from the prior year quarter was mainly attributable to the aforementioned net gains on sale of investment securities.\nNoninterest expenses totaled $17.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $0.5 million from $16.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and a decrease of $1.2 million from $18.2 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase from the prior sequential quarter was mainly attributable to increases in salaries and employee benefits ($0.3 million), occupancy and equipment expenses ($0.2 million) and other expenses ($0.3 million), offset by a valuation allowance adjustment on taxi medallion loans held-for-sale of $0.3 million that occurred during the prior sequential quarter. The decrease in noninterest expenses from the prior year first quarter was mainly attributable to increases in salaries and employee benefits ($1.5 million), offset by valuation allowance adjustment on taxi medallion loans held-for-sale of $2.6 million that occurred during the prior year quarter. The increases over the prior year fourth quarter were the result of increased levels of business and staff resulting from organic growth.\nIncome tax expense was $0.4 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $12.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $4.9 million for the first quarter of 2017. Included in income tax expenses for the first quarter of 2018 was an income tax benefit of $0.5 million resulting from the effect of ASU 2016-09 , Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . Included in income tax expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 was a $5.6 million DTA valuation estimated charge related to the Tax Act. At the present time, the Bank is projecting a 2018 effective tax rate of approximately 21%, exclusive of ASU 2016-09 benefits.\nAsset Quality\nThe provision for loan losses was $17.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase from the prior sequential quarter was largely attributable to $17.0 million of provision related to the taxi medallion loan portfolio, offset by a decrease in loan growth. The increase from the prior year quarter was mainly attributable to the aforementioned taxi medallion loan provision. The provision related to taxi medallions primarily resulted from decreases in the transfer values as reported by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission and a reduction in the Bank’s cash flow valuation model.\nAs of March 31, 2018, loans secured by New York City taxi medallions had a carrying value of $29.4 million, down significantly from $46.8 million as of December 31, 2017, reflecting the aforementioned provision (and subsequent charge-off) and cash flow applied to principal. As of March 31, 2018, the medallion loans had a carrying value of approximately $216,000 per medallion, compared to $343,000 as of December 31, 2017.\nNonperforming assets, which includes nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned, were $51.1 million at March 31, 2018, $66.2 million at December 31, 2017 and $72.4 million at March 31, 2017. Included in nonperforming assets were taxi medallion loans totaling $29.4 million at March 31, 2018, $46.8 million at December 31, 2017 and $59.1 million at March 31, 2017. Excluding the taxi medallion loans, nonaccrual loans were $20.6 million at March 31, 2018, $18.8 million at December 31, 2017 and $12.8 million at March 31, 2017, representing 0.49%, 0.46% and 0.36%, respectively, of nonaccrual loans (excluding taxis) as a percentage of loans receivable. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were 0.99% at March 31, 2018, 1.29% at December 31, 2017 and 1.62% at March 31, 2017.\nThe net loan charge-offs (recoveries) ratio was 1.63% for the first quarter of 2018, 0.01% for the fourth quarter of 2017 and (0.01%) for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in the net loan charge-off ratio for the first quarter of 2018 was attributable to a $17.0 million charge-off related to the taxi medallion portfolio. The allowance for loan losses represented 0.77%, 0.76%, and 0.75% of loans receivable as of March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans was 65.0% as of March 31, 2018, 48.4% as of December 31, 2017 and 37.4% as of March 31, 2017. Excluding the taxi medallion loans, allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans was 157.7% as of March 31, 2018, 168.4% as of December 31, 2017 and 210.3% as of March 31, 2017.\nSelected Balance Sheet Items\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company’s total assets were $5.2 billion, an increase of $50 million from December 31, 2017, largely a result of net loan growth (loan originations less pay-downs and pay-offs) of $52 million. The Company’s stockholders’ equity was $564 million at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $1 million from December 31, 2017. The decrease in stockholders’ equity was primarily attributable to increases in other comprehensive losses of $3 million, offset by an increase of $2 million in retained earnings. As of March 31, 2018, the Company’s tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per share were 8.31% and $12.93, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per share were 8.41% and $13.01, respectively. Total goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $148 million as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to the results presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), ConnectOne routinely supplements its evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP/adjusted financial measures including an adjusted net income available to common shareholders.
