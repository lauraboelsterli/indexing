    "text": "JACKSON, Miss.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (NASDAQ: CALM) today announced the Company was notified after the close of business on April 13, 2018, by Rose Acre Farms of Seymour, Indiana, of a voluntary egg recall. The eggs involved in the recall have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella Braenderup and were distributed from Rose Acre Farms’ Hyde County, North Carolina, facility from January 11, 2018, through April 12, 2018. Salmonella Braenderup can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy individuals infected with Salmonella Braenderup can experience fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella Braenderup can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.\nThis press release features multimedia.
