We don’t think so. We think that the ECB will keep its policy normalisation stable.”\nBetter than expected activity in the French private sector in April, according to a survey, was offset by worse than forecast activity in Germany.\nAgainst a basket of currencies the dollar rose 0.2 percent to 90.453, staying within sight of a two-week high of 90.477 set on Friday. The rise in bond yields also weakened Asian emerging market currencies versus the dollar, with the Chinese yuan down and the Indonesian rupiah hitting a two-year low of 13,895 per dollar.\nAgainst the yen, the dollar hit a two-month high of 107.94 yen, up 0.2 percent on the day.\nEasing concerns over global political risks weighed on the Japanese currency, market participants said, as the yen tends to attract demand in times of economic uncertainty and market turmoil, and sell off when confidence returns.\nNorth Korea said on Saturday it would immediately suspend nuclear and missile tests, scrap its nuclear test site and pursue economic growth and peace instead. It made these comments ahead of planned summits with South Korea and the United States.\n“The dollar momentum...is probably going to carry the way at least until the next negative headline comes out,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for Oanda in Singapore.\nEven traders who had been bearish on the dollar seem to be looking for opportunities to take long positions, Innes added.\nOther analysts said net long dollar positions had not risen significantly in recent weeks, despite concerns over geopolitical risks and worries over U.S.-China trade tensions appearing to be waning.\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Saturday he may travel to China, a move that could ease tensions between the world’s two largest economies.
