    "text": "Associated British Foods on Tuesday reported a 1 percent fall in first-half profit, with a resilient performance at its Primark fashion business offset by a previously flagged reduction in sugar revenues.\nFor the six months to March 3 AB Foods, which also owns major ingredients and grocery businesses, made adjusted operating profit of 648 million pounds ($929 million). That compares with company guidance of a \"flat\" outcome and 652 million pounds made in the first half of its 2016-17 year.\nThe group maintained its full-year outlook, forecasting \"progress\" in both adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share (EPS).",
