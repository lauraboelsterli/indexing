    "text": "HAUPPAUGE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TSR, Inc. (Nasdaq:TSRI), a provider of computer programming consulting services, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended February 28, 2018.\nFor the quarter ended February 28th, revenue decreased to $15,058,000 from $15,390,000 in the same quarter last year. Net loss attributable to TSR was $19,000 in the current quarter, as compared with a loss attributable to TSR of $68,000 in the prior year quarter. Additionally, net loss per share was $0.01 in the current quarter compared with a loss of $0.03 in the prior year quarter.\nChristopher Hughes, CEO, stated, “Our revenue for the quarter ended February 28, 2018 decreased $332,000 from the prior year comparable quarter. This decrease resulted primarily from heavier than usual furloughing of consultants on billing with customers around the holidays and other customer budget reduction measures. The overall average number of consultants on billing with customers decreased from 394 for the quarter ended February 28, 2017 to 370 for the quarter ended February 28, 2018, while the average number of computer programming consultants decreased from 328 in the quarter ended February 28, 2017 to 324 in the current quarter. The 370 consultants on billing for the current quarter include 46 administrative workers, compared with 66 in the prior year quarter, which we placed at billing rates substantially lower than those charged for computer programming consultants. The net loss decreased from the prior year quarter due to a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses of $197,000 compared with the prior year quarter resulting primarily from the retirement of the former Chairman and other cost savings.”\nCertain statements contained herein, including statements as to the Company’s plans, future prospects and future cash flow requirements are forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements due to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, the following: the success of the Company’s plan for internal growth, the impact of adverse economic conditions on client spending which has a negative impact on the Company’s business; risks relating to the competitive nature of the markets for contract computer programming services; the extent to which market conditions for the Company’s contract computer programming services will continue to adversely affect the Company’s business; the concentration of the Company’s business with certain customers; uncertainty as to the Company’s ability to maintain its relations with existing customers and expand its business; the impact of changes in the industry such as the use of vendor management companies in connection with the consultant procurement process; the increase in customers moving IT operations offshore and the Company’s ability to adapt to changing market conditions and other risks and uncertainties described in the Company’s filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company is under no obligation to publicly update or revise forward-looking statements.\nThree Months Ended\nFebruary 28,\n(unaudited)\nNine Months Ended\nFebruary 28,\n(unaudited)\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nRevenue, net\n$\n15,058,000\n$\n15,390,000\n$\n48,610,000\n$\n45,675,000\nCost of sales 12,772,000 12,988,000 40,760,000 38,082,000 Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,324,000\n2,521,000\n7,180,000 7,181,000 Total operating expenses 15,096,000 15,509,000 47,940,000 45,263,000 Income (loss) from operations (38,000 ) (119,000 ) 670,000 412,000 Other income (expense), net 7,000 4,000 19,000 12,000 Pre-tax income (loss) (31,000 ) (115,000 ) 689,000 424,000 Income tax provision (benefit) (23,000 )\n(58,000 ) 283,000 188,000 Consolidated net income (loss) (8,000\n)\n(57,000\n)\n406,000\n236,000\nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest\n11,000\n11,000\n57,000\n30,000\nNet income (loss) attributable to TSR, Inc.\n$ (19,000 ) $ (68,000 ) $ 349,000 $ 206,000 Net income (loss) per TSR, Inc. common share\n$\n(0.01\n)\n$\n(0.03\n)\n$\n0.18\n$\n0.10\nWeighted average common shares outstanding 1,962,000\n1,962,000\n1,962,000\n1,962,000\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180412006060/en/\nTSR, Inc.\nJohn Sharkey, 631-231-0333\nSource: TSR, Inc.",
