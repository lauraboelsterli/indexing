FILE PHOTO: A TSB sign is seen outside the bank's Baker Street branch in London September 9, 2013. REUTERS/Andrew Winning \n“We are currently experiencing large volumes of customers accessing our mobile app and internet banking which is leading to some intermittent issues with people accessing our services,” TSB said in a statement. \n“We are really sorry for the inconvenience this is causing our customers and want them to know we are working as hard and as fast as we can to resolve this problem.” \nIt gave no further details on how many customers had been affected.
