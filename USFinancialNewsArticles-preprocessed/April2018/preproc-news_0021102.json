    "text": "(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has collected more than $762 million in fines since 2007, after the U.S. Energy Policy Act of 2005 significantly increased the penalties it can impose.\nThe Energy Policy Act boosted the penalties FERC can assess to up to $1 million per day per violation from a prior cap of $10,000 per day.\nIn addition, FERC has ordered companies to disgorge over $478 million since 2007.\nReporting by Scott DiSavino\n ",
