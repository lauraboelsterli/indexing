    "text": "0 COMMENTS BERLIN—German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday kick-started what promised to be difficult talk about strengthening the eurozone’s architecture, as Berlin maintained its skepticism over ambitious French proposals to deepen the integration of the currency union’s economies.\nMr. Macron has been seeking support from Ms. Merkel for his campaign to overhaul the eurozone’s institutions, with proposals for common spending and burden-sharing, and was counting on Thursday’s meeting to overcome resistance from the German chancellor.\nHowever, at a joint press conference ahead of the talks, Ms. Merkel remained noncommittal.\n“We both are of the opinion that the eurozone is not yet fortified against crises. There are French proposals to resolve this, but there are also German ones,” she said.\nThe meeting comes just days before both leaders travel in succession to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump next week. During Thursday’s meeting, the two leaders will discuss ways to avert a trade war with the U.S., as Paris and Berlin seek to hammer out a joint line on trade before their arrival in Washington, officials on both sides said.\nMs. Merkel and Mr. Macron will also discuss a range of other critical issues, including the Iran nuclear deal, the Syrian crisis and diplomatic tensions with Russia, a French official said.\nDuring the press conference, Mr. Macron offered renewed enthusiasm for his vision of a strengthened eurozone that would be better able to withstand future financial crisis.\nMr. Macron’s proposals include creating a substantial eurozone budget to be used for investment and to insulate weaker economies from market pressure, as well as a banking union that would enable sharing of liabilities.\n“The most important thing isn’t to react to such-and-such instrument, but to be sure that we share the same purpose and to have a political objective,” Mr. Macron said.\nMr. Macron has been counting on Thursday’s meeting as an opportunity to persuade Ms. Merkel to see the virtues of his plans for overhauling the euro, EU’s common currency, after members of her governing coalition criticized them and ruled out major progress at the summit of European leaders in June.\n“What counts for us is what the chancellor says, and the chancellor is clearly open-minded and open to discussion,” a French official said. “I’m not saying it’s easy—we’re talking about subjects that are almost as important as the creation of the single currency.”\nHowever, German officials as well as politicians from Ms. Merkel’s own party say their government won’t be able to support any initiatives requiring the sharing of liabilities or major investments.\nDespite the growing signs of inertia in Germany, Mr. Macron continues to insist that the European project can’t advance in the coming years unless steps are taken to deepen the ties among eurozone countries.\nThe two leaders are likely to find more common ground on approaching the trade talks with the U.S. that were prompted by President Donald Trump’s threat of tariffs on steel and aluminum.\nGermany is driving a push for the EU to offer Mr. Trump a wide-ranging trade agreement that would give significant concessions, such as lowering tariffs on U.S.-made cars, agricultural products and pharmaceuticals. Under the proposals still being discussed, Europe would also join forces with the U.S. in tackling what both see as China’s unfair trade practices, according to several senior European officials.\n“The trans-Atlantic partnership is important for me…this bond is a great treasure in the light of the many undemocratic developments in this world and we must nurture it,” Ms. Merkel said.",
