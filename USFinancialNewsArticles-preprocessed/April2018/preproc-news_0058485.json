    "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - New U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said President Donald Trump has not taken a decision on whether to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal but was not likely to keep to it without substantial changes.\n“There’s been no decision, so the team is working and I am sure we will have lots of conversations to deliver what the president has made clear,” Pompeo told a news conference after a NATO meeting of foreign ministers.\n“Absent a substantial fix, absent overcoming the flaws of the deal, he is unlikely to stay in that deal,” Pompeo said.\nReporting by Robin Emmott and Lesley Wroughton; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ",
