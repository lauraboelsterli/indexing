Sarah Clarke is introduced as the new Black Rod to the House of Lords in London, Britain February 20, 2018. REUTERS/Victoria Jones/Pool\nLords, who sit in parliament’s upper chamber, voted 335 to 244 in favour of an amendment that could allow parliament to send Britain back to the negotiating table in Brussels or even halt the Brexit process.\nThe amendment is opposed by the government and can be overturned in parliament’s lower chamber, where May has a slim majority.
