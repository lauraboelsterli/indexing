Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attends a news conference at Canada's Embassy in London, Britain, April 19, 2018. REUTERS/Henry Nicholls \nThe Queen said earlier on Thursday that she hoped her son and heir would take on leadership of the Commonwealth, answering some who argue the position should be rotated around member states. \n“I very much agree with the wishes of her majesty that the Prince of Wales be the next head of the Commonwealth,” Trudeau said at an event in London.
