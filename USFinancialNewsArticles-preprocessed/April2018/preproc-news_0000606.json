(OTCPK: CVOVQ) (the \"Company\"), a diversified manufacturer of print-related products including envelopes, custom labels, commercial print, and publisher solutions, today announced that it has filed a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization (the \"Plan\") and related disclosure statement (\"Disclosure Statement\") with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, White Plains. The Plan outlines a proposed path to strengthen the Company's balance sheet, increase its financial flexibility, and position it for long-term success.\n\"We are continuing to make significant progress as we enter the next phase of our restructuring,\" said Robert G.

We will continue to work closely with all of our stakeholders to refine the Plan, as this is a critical step to achieving our timeline of emerging from this restructuring process in the summer of 2018.\"\nA hearing has been scheduled with the Court on May 16, 2018 to consider approval of the Disclosure Statement related to the Plan.

It is possible the Company's outstanding securities may be cancelled and extinguished upon confirmation of a restructuring plan by the Bankruptcy Court. In such an event, the Company's stockholders and other security holders would not be entitled to receive or retain any cash, securities or other property on account of their cancelled securities. Trading prices for the Company's common stock and other securities may bear little or no relation to actual recovery, if any, by holders thereof in the Company's Chapter 11 cases. Accordingly, the Company urges extreme caution with respect to existing and future investments in its securities.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis document contains certain forward-looking statements.
