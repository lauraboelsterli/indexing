    "text": "PODGORICA (Reuters) - Veteran pro-European Union politician Milo Djukanovic was set to win Montenegro’s presidential election on Sunday with 54 percent of votes, according to a projection by the Centre for Monitoring and Research (CeMI) pollster.\nMilo Djukanovic, the presidential candidate of the ruling DPS party (Democratic party of Socialists), casts his vote during Montenegro's presidential election, in Podgorica, Montenegro April 15, 2018. REUTERS/Marko Djurica Mladen Bojanic, a businessman backed by an alliance of parties, including some wanting closer ties with Russia, was set to come second with 33 percent, CeMI said, based on a partial count of the votes in a sample of polling stations.\nDjukanovic and his ruling Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) led Montenegro into NATO last year and have pledged to complete talks for EU membership.\n“There will be no second round,” Milos Nikolic, a DPS parliamentary deputy told reporters at the party’s headquarters. “Djukanovic is the new president of Montenegro.”\nSupporters of Milo Djukanovic, the presidential candidate of the ruling DPS party (Democratic Party of Socialists), are seen celebrating in the DPS' headquarters in Podgorica, Montenegro, April 15, 2018. REUTERS/Marko Djurica The state election commission said turnout at 7.30 p.m (1730 GMT), half an hour before the polling stations closed, stood at 61.6 percent.\n“This (result) is a serious indication of how final results might look, though results might deviate slightly,” said Milos Besic, an lecturer in political sciences at the Belgrade University who monitors Montenegro’s vote.\nSlideshow (10 Images) After casting his ballot, Djukanovic said he was convinced he would win in the first round.\n“I am convinced Montenegro will confirm its determination to continue on the path of European development,” Djukanovic said.\nNo significant election irregularities have been reported.\nAlthough the presidential role is largely ceremonial, if Djukanovic wins and replaces his ally Filip Vujanovic, he is expected to wield considerable power and influence policy through the ranks of the DPS.\nHaving dominated politics in the tiny Adriatic country of only 620,000 and an ex-Yugoslav republic since 1991, either as prime minister or president, Djukanovic last stepped down as prime minister in 2016. He announced his comeback last month citing “responsibility for Montenegro’s future”.\nDuring the campaign, opposition candidates accused Djukanovic of fostering cronyism, nepotism, corruption and ties with organized crime, which he denies.\n“I am proud of my result,” Bojanic told repoters after projections were released. “I will continue the struggle to liberate Montenegro from Djukanovic’s dictatorship,” he said.\nReporting by Aleksandar Vasovic; Editing by Ivana Sekularac, Adrian Croft and David Evans\n ",
