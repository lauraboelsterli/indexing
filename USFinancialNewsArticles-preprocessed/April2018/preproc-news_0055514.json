(Nasdaq:BOOM) today reported financial results for its\nSales were $67.3 million, a 24% sequential increase and a 73% improvement versus 2017. The increase was due to strong demand and improved pricing at DynaEnergetics, DMC’s oilfield products business, and better-than-expected sales at NobelClad, the Company’s explosion welding business. First quarter gross margin was 34% versus 33% in the fourth quarter and 27% in the year-ago first quarter.\nOperating income was $5.3 million versus an operating loss of $2.3 million in last year’s first quarter. Net income was $3.9 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, versus a net loss of $3.0 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, in the year-ago first quarter.\nExcluding $3.1 million in accrued anti-dumping penalties and $144,000 in restructuring expenses, first quarter adjusted operating income was $8.6 million and adjusted net income was $7.2 million, or $0.49 per diluted share. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $11.6 million versus $7.7 million in the fourth quarter and $930,000 in last year’s first quarter.\nNet debt* (lines of credit less cash and cash equivalents) at March 31, 2018, was $18.6 million versus $9.0 million at December 31, 2017. The increase primarily was attributable to borrowings to fund working capital and for the construction of DynaEnergetics' new 74,000-square-foot manufacturing, assembly and administrative facility at its manufacturing site in Blum, Texas.\nDynaEnergetics\nFirst quarter sales at DynaEnergetics were a record $49.1 million, up 32% sequentially and 123% versus last year’s first quarter. Gross margin was 40%, up from 33% in last year's first quarter. Operating income was $8.7 million versus $40,000 in the comparable year-ago quarter. Excluding accrued anti-dumping penalties, adjusted operating income was $11.8 million dollars. Adjusted EBITDA was $13.4 million versus $1.7 million in the 2017 first quarter.\nNobelClad\nNobelClad reported third-quarter sales of $18.2 million, up 5% sequentially and 7% versus the 2017 first quarter. Gross margin was 18% versus 19% in last year's first quarter. Operating loss was $12,000 versus operating income of $395,000 in the year-ago quarter. Excluding restructuring charges related to NobelClad’s European consolidation program, adjusted operating income was $132,000. Adjusted EBITDA was $948,000 versus $1.4 million in last year's first quarter.\nNobelClad’s trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio at the end of the first quarter was 1.04. Order backlog was $35.6 versus $37.5 million at the end of the 2017 fourth quarter.\nManagement Commentary\nKevin Longe, president and CEO, said, “Stronger-than-expected sales of DynaEnergetics’ intrinsically safe DynaSelect™ detonators and the Factory-assembled, Performance-assured™ DynaStage™ system, combined with improved pricing, resulted in first quarter consolidated financial results that exceeded our forecasts. North America’s unconventional onshore oil and gas industry remains very active, and a growing number of operators and service companies are turning to these systems to enhance well-completion efficiencies, improve reliability and drive down operating costs.\n“The capacity expansion initiatives underway at DynaEnergetics’ facilities in Texas, Pennsylvania and Germany are all progressing on schedule. In addition, the business has successfully addressed various bottlenecks in its supply chain, which should accelerate the ramp up in DynaStage production.\n“I am very encouraged by our start to fiscal 2018, and by our prospects for continued operational and financial growth. I would like to thank our employees around the world for their continued commitment to the Company’s growth and success.”\nGuidance\nMichael Kuta, CFO, said second quarter sales are expected in a range of $74 million to $76 million versus the $47.2 million reported in the 2017-second quarter. At the business level, DynaEnergetics is expected to report sales in a range of $54 million to $56 million versus the $26.8 million reported in last year’s second quarter, while NobelClad’s sales are expected to be approximately $20 million versus the $20.4 million reported in last year’s second quarter. Consolidated gross margin is expected to be 33% to 34% versus the 30% in last year’s second quarter.\nSecond quarter selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense is expected to be in a range of $14.5 million to $15 million versus the $10.6 million in the 2017 second quarter. The anticipated increase principally relates to higher litigation expense at DynaEnergetics. Amortization expense is expected to be approximately $800,000 versus $1.0 million in the second quarter last year, while interest expense is expected to be approximately $500,000.\nSecond quarter adjusted EBITDA is expected in a range of $12 million to $13 million versus $6.0 million in last year’s second quarter.\nKuta said consolidated sales for the full fiscal year are now expected in a range of $290 million to $305 million versus a prior forecast of $255 million to $270 million. DynaEnergetics’ sales are expected in a range of $215 million to $225 million versus a prior forecast of $180 million to $190 million. The increase reflects increased confidence at DynaEnergetics that recent supply chain improvements and accelerated capacity-expansion efforts will enable the business to more rapidly address growing customer demand. The forecast for NobelClad’s sales are unchanged at $75 million to $80 million. Full-year gross margin is expected in a range of 33% to 34% versus the previously forecasted range of 31% to 32%.\nFull-year SG&A is now expected to be approximately $55 million versus a prior forecast of $50 million to $52 million. The increase relates to higher-than-expected litigation expense at DynaEnergetics, as certain patent infringement cases proceed to trial in October 2018. Amortization expense is expected to be approximately $3.0 million. Full-year interest expense is expected in a range of $2.0 million to $2.25 million. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2018 is expected in a range of 28% to 30%.\nEarnings per diluted share for 2018 are expected in a range of $1.60 to $1.70. Excluding restructuring and potential anti-dumping penalties, adjusted net income per share* is expected in a range of $1.90 to $2.00.\nAdjusted EBITDA is now expected to be in a range of $52 million to $56 million, up from a prior forecast range of $39 million to $43 million.\nAnticipated full-year capital expenditures are unchanged from a prior forecast of $30 million, $25 million of which relates to the capacity expansion at DynaEnergetics.\nConference call information\nManagement will hold a conference call to discuss these results today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern (3:00 p.m. Mountain).

Non-GAAP results are presented only as a supplement to the financial statements based on U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial information is provided to enhance the reader's understanding of DMC’s financial performance, but no non-GAAP measure should be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of the most directly comparable GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided within the schedules attached to this release.\nEBITDA is defined as net income plus or minus net interest plus taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA excludes from EBITDA stock-based compensation, restructuring and impairment charges and, when appropriate, other items that management does not utilize in assessing DMC’s operating performance (as further described in the attached financial schedules). Adjusted operating income (loss) is defined as operating income (loss) plus restructuring and impairment charges and, when appropriate, other items that management does not utilize in assessing DMC’s operating performance. Adjusted net income (loss) is defined as net income (loss) plus restructuring and impairment charges and, when appropriate, other items that management does not utilize in assessing DMC’s operating performance. Adjusted net income per diluted (loss) share is defined as diluted net income (loss) per share plus restructuring and impairment charges and, when appropriate, other items that management does not utilize in assessing DMC’s operating performance. Net debt is defined as lines of credit less cash and cash equivalents. None of these non-GAAP financial measures are recognized terms under GAAP and do not purport to be an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or any other GAAP measure.\nManagement uses adjusted EBITDA in its operational and financial decision-making, believing that it is useful to eliminate certain items in order to focus on what it deems to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance. As a result, internal management reports used during monthly operating reviews feature adjusted EBITDA measures. Management believes that investors may find this non-GAAP financial measure useful for similar reasons, although investors are cautioned that non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for GAAP disclosures. In addition, management incentive awards are based, in part, on the amount of adjusted EBITDA achieved during relevant periods. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are also used by research analysts, investment bankers and lenders to assess operating performance. For example, a measure similar to adjusted EBITDA is required by the lenders under DMC’s credit facility.\nNet debt is used by management to supplement GAAP financial information and evaluate DMC’s performance, and management believes this information may be similarly useful to investors. Adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share are presented because management believes these measures are useful to understand the effects of restructuring and impairment charges on DMC’s operating income (loss), net income (loss) and diluted earnings (loss) per share, respectively.\nBecause not all companies use identical calculations, DMC’s presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. However, these measures can still be useful in evaluating the company’s performance against its peer companies because management believes the measures provide users with valuable insight into key components of GAAP financial disclosures. For example, a company with greater GAAP net income may not be as appealing to investors if its net income is more heavily comprised of gains on asset sales. Likewise, eliminating the effects of interest income and expense moderates the impact of a company's capital structure on its performance.\nAll of the items included in the reconciliation from net income to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are either (i) non-cash items (e.g., depreciation, amortization of purchased intangibles and stock-based compensation) or (ii) items that management does not consider to be useful in assessing DMC’s operating performance (e.g., income taxes, restructuring and impairment charges). In the case of the non-cash items, management believes that investors can better assess the company’s operating performance if the measures are presented without such items because, unlike cash expenses, these adjustments do not affect DMC's ability to generate free cash flow or invest in its business. For example, by adjusting for depreciation and amortization in computing EBITDA, users can compare operating performance without regard to different accounting determinations such as useful life. In the case of the other items, management believes that investors can better assess operating performance if the measures are presented without these items because their financial impact does not reflect ongoing operating performance.\nAbout DMC\nBased in Boulder, Colorado, DMC operates in two sectors: industrial infrastructure and oilfield products and services.
