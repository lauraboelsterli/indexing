    "text": "EULESS, Texas, April 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- U.S. Concrete, Inc. (NASDAQ: USCR), a leading producer of construction materials in select major markets across the United States, today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 HIGHLIGHTS COMPARED TO FIRST QUARTER 2017\nConsolidated revenue increased 9.6% to $327.8 million Ready-mixed concrete revenue increased 5.0% to $289.2 million Ready-mixed concrete average sales price improved 2.0% to $136.99 per cubic yard Aggregate products revenue increased 83.3% to $32.7 million Aggregate products average sales price increased 14.1% to $14.36 per ton Completed three acquisitions, including ready-mixed concrete plants in key growth markets enhancing the Company's established presence in the New York metro and Philadelphia regions, and ready-mixed concrete plants and aggregate reserves within Texas, which increased vertical integration Ready-mixed concrete backlog increased 11.0% to an all-time high of 8.2 million cubic yards\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 RESULTS COMPARED TO FIRST QUARTER 2017\nConsolidated revenue increased 9.6% to $327.8 million, compared to $299.1 million in the prior year first quarter. Revenue from the ready-mixed concrete segment increased $13.8 million, or 5.0%, compared to the prior year first quarter, driven by acquisition volume and pricing. The Company's ready-mixed concrete sales volume was 2.1 million cubic yards, up 2.2% compared to the prior year first quarter. Ready-mixed concrete average sales price per cubic yard increased $2.71, or 2.0%, to $136.99 compared to $134.28 in the prior year first quarter. Ready-mixed concrete material spread increased to $67.34 per cubic yard, compared to $66.70 per cubic yard in the prior year first quarter. Ready-mixed concrete backlog at the end of the 2018 first quarter was approximately 8.2 million cubic yards, up 11.0% compared to the end of the prior year first quarter and up 4.0% compared to 2017 year end. Aggregate products sales volume was 2.1 million tons, up 71.3% compared to the prior year first quarter, including the benefit of 2017 acquisitions. Aggregate products average sales price increased 14.1% to $14.36 per ton in the 2018 first quarter compared to the prior year first quarter.\nDuring the 2018 first quarter, operating income was $7.5 million compared to $21.3 million in the first quarter of 2017, with an operating income margin of 2.3% compared to 7.1% in the first quarter of 2017. The first quarter of 2018 included the negative impact of weather-related challenges as we experienced the wettest February on record in the Dallas/Ft. Worth metroplex and four nor'easters impacted our Atlantic region during March. These weather delays did not result in the cancellation of work, only deferring it into future quarters. On a non-GAAP basis, our consolidated Adjusted Gross Profit was $61.7 million in the 2018 first quarter compared to $63.4 million in the prior year first quarter, with an Adjusted Gross Margin of 18.8% compared to 21.2% in the prior year first quarter. Adjusted Gross Margin declined as a result of a change in overall product mix and the negative impact of weather-related delays in some of our major markets. Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin are non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the definitions, reconciliations and other information at the end of this press release.\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses were $32.3 million in the 2018 first quarter compared to $25.8 million in the prior year first quarter. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 9.8% in the 2018 first quarter compared to 8.6% in the prior year first quarter. We incurred $2.5 million in acquisition-related costs during the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. We also incurred $2.2 million in non-cash stock compensation expense during the first quarter of 2018 compared to $1.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. On a non-GAAP basis, our Adjusted SG&A, which excludes acquisition-related costs and non-cash stock compensation expense, was $27.5 million for the 2018 first quarter compared to $23.2 million in the prior year first quarter, reflecting increased personnel-related costs to support our growth initiatives and acquisition strategy as well as the impact of SG&A from recent acquisitions. Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 8.4% in the 2018 first quarter, compared to 7.8% in the prior year first quarter. Adjusted SG&A and Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of revenue are non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the definitions, reconciliations and other information at the end of this press release.\nDuring the 2018 first quarter, our loss from continuing operations was $3.8 million, as compared to income from continuing operations of $7.0 million in the 2017 first quarter. Total Adjusted EBITDA was $36.0 million in the 2018 first quarter. Ready-mixed concrete segment Adjusted EBITDA was $41.0 million in the 2018 first quarter, which was adversely impacted by weather compared to the prior year. Aggregate products Adjusted EBITDA of $5.0 million in the 2018 first quarter increased $1.0 million compared to the prior year first quarter primarily related to higher sales volumes, including the benefit of 2017 acquisitions, despite significant weather-related delays during the quarter. Total Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the definitions, reconciliations and other information at the end of this press release.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the net loss attributable to U.S. Concrete was $3.9 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared to net income attributable to U.S. Concrete of $6.9 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations was $3.0 million, or $0.18 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $11.2 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, in the prior year first quarter, including the impact of a normalized tax rate of 26% in both periods. Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations and Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations per Diluted Share are non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the definitions, reconciliations and other information at the end of this press release.\nMANAGEMENT COMMENTARY\nWilliam J. Sandbrook, President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chairman of U.S. Concrete stated, \"Despite yet another challenging quarter due to weather, we are pleased to report multiple financial accomplishments, including our 29th straight quarter of year-over-year revenue growth, our 28th straight quarter of ready-mixed concrete pricing growth as well as a new first quarter revenue high of $328 million. We continue to maintain our focus on operating excellence and push forward with accelerated efforts on integrating our recent acquisitions, which were strong contributors for the quarter.\"\nMr. Sandbrook continued, \"We have a lot to be excited about heading into the peak months of the construction season and are optimistic about the rest of the year. We have grown and maintained record backlog levels, we have just scratched the surface on the production and earnings capacity of our recent acquisitions and demand remains high in all of our markets, which we intend to capitalize on in the coming months with the cooperation of more normalized weather.\"\nMr. Sandbrook concluded, \"Our recent acquisition of Polaris Materials represents a key success in our vertical integration growth strategy. The addition means more than just an internal source of aggregates for our ready-mixed concrete business in Northern California and entrance into new markets, but represents our ability to provide high-quality materials in otherwise supply-constrained areas for the foreseeable future. Our integration of Polaris remains ahead of our internal plan, and we continue to aggressively work on the acceleration of volume into the various markets we serve as well as plans to further develop land acquired as part of the transaction for additional capacity. We are extremely excited and confident with the anticipated returns from this dynamic acquisition.\"\nBALANCE SHEET AND LIQUIDITY\nNet cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2018 was $25.9 million, compared to net cash provided by operating activities in the prior year first quarter of $29.5 million. The reduction in net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2018 primarily related to lower net income. The Company's Adjusted Free Cash Flow in the first quarter of 2018 was $19.5 million, which primarily reflects the impact of working capital changes, as compared to $19.6 million in the prior year first quarter. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the definitions, reconciliations and other information at the end of this press release.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $36.6 million and total debt of $755.7 million, resulting in Net Debt of $719.1 million. Net Debt increased by $48.4 million from December 31, 2017, largely as a result of the successful deployment of capital for the continued execution of our acquisition strategy and capital expenditures for plant equipment to support the growing demands in our markets. The Company had $137.7 million of unused availability under its revolving credit facility at March 31, 2018. Net Debt is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the definitions, reconciliations and other information at the end of this press release.\nCONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST DETAILS\nU.S. Concrete will host a conference call on Monday, April 30, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (9:00 a.m. Central Time), to review its first quarter 2018 results.

We define Total Adjusted EBITDA as our income (loss) from continuing operations, excluding the impact of income tax expense (benefit), depreciation, depletion and amortization, net interest expense, derivative (income) loss, non-cash change in value of contingent consideration, hurricane-related losses, quarry dredge costs for specific event, purchase accounting adjustments for inventory, non-cash stock compensation expense, acquisition-related costs and officer transition expenses. Acquisition-related costs consist of fees and expenses for accountants, lawyers and other professionals incurred during the negotiation and closing of strategic acquisitions and certain acquired entities' management severance costs. Acquisition-related costs do not include fees or expenses associated with post-closing integration of strategic acquisitions. We define Total Adjusted EBITDA Margin as the amount determined by dividing Total Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue. We have included Total Adjusted EBITDA and Total Adjusted EBITDA Margin herein because they are widely used by investors for valuation and comparing our financial performance with the performance of other building material companies. We also use Total Adjusted EBITDA and Total Adjusted EBITDA Margin to monitor and compare the financial performance of our operations. Total Adjusted EBITDA does not give effect to the cash we must use to service our debt or pay our income taxes and thus does not reflect the funds actually available for capital expenditures. In addition, our presentation of Total Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures other companies report. Total Adjusted EBITDA and Total Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not intended to be used as an alternative to any measure of our performance in accordance with GAAP. The following table reconciles Total Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, which is income (loss) from continuing operations (in thousands).\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nTotal Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations\n$\n(3,816)\n$\n7,002\nAdd: Income tax expense\n1,652\n6,702\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes\n(2,164)\n13,704\nAdd: Depreciation, depletion and amortization\n20,575\n15,859\nAdd: Interest expense, net\n11,309\n10,142\nAdd: Derivative income\n—\n(1,856)\nAdd: Non-cash change in value of contingent consideration\n368\n608\nAdd: Hurricane-related losses\n307\n—\nAdd: Quarry dredge costs for specific event\n191\n—\nAdd: Purchase accounting adjustments for inventory\n706\n—\nAdd: Non-cash stock compensation expense\n2,172\n1,619\nAdd: Acquisition-related costs\n2,539\n413\nAdd: Officer transition expenses\n—\n584\nTotal Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n36,003\n$\n41,073\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations margin\n(1.2)\n%\n2.3\n%\nTotal Adjusted EBITDA Margin\n11.0\n%\n13.7\n%\nAdjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin\nAdjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin are non-GAAP financial measures.

We also adjust Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations for a normalized effective income tax rate of 26%. We define Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations per Diluted Share as Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations on a diluted per share basis. Acquisition-related costs consist of fees and expenses for accountants, lawyers and other professionals incurred during the negotiation and closing of strategic acquisitions and certain acquired entities' management severance costs. Acquisition-related costs do not include fees or expenses associated with post-closing integration of strategic acquisitions.\nWe have included Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations and Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations per Diluted Share herein because they are used by investors for valuation and comparing our financial performance with the performance of other building material companies. We use Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations and Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations per Diluted Share to monitor and compare the financial performance of our operations. Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations and Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations per Diluted Share are not intended to be used as an alternative to any measure of our performance in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following tables reconcile (i) Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, which is net income (loss) attributable to U.S. Concrete and (ii) Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations per Diluted Share to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, which is net income (loss) attributable to U.S. Concrete per diluted share (in thousands, except per share amounts).\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nAdjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations Reconciliation\nNet income (loss) attributable to U.S. Concrete\n$\n(3,858)\n$\n6,880\nAdd: Net income attributable to non-controlling interest\n42\n—\nAdd: Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes\n—\n122\nAdd: Income tax expense\n1,652\n6,702\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes\n(2,164)\n13,704\nLess: Derivative income\n—\n(1,856)\nAdd: Non-cash change in value of contingent consideration\n368\n608\nAdd: Hurricane-related losses\n307\n—\nAdd: Quarry dredge costs for specific event\n191\n—\nAdd: Purchase accounting adjustments for inventory\n706\n—\nAdd: Non-cash stock compensation expense\n2,172\n1,619\nAdd: Acquisition-related costs\n2,539\n413\nAdd: Officer transition expenses\n—\n584\nAdjusted income from continuing operations before income taxes\n4,119\n15,072\nLess: Normalized income tax expense (1)\n1,071\n3,919\nAdjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations (non-GAAP)\n$\n3,048\n$\n11,153\n(1) Assumes a normalized effective tax rate of 26% in both periods.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018 (1)\n2017\nAdjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations per Diluted Share Reconciliation\nNet income (loss) attributable to U.S. Concrete per diluted share\n$\n(0.23)\n$\n0.42\nAdd: Net income attributable to non-controlling interest\n—\n—\nAdd: Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes per diluted share\n—\n0.01\nAdd: Income tax expense per diluted share\n0.10\n0.40\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes per diluted share\n(0.13)\n0.83\nLess: Impact of derivative income\n—\n(0.11)\nAdd: Impact of non-cash change in value of contingent consideration\n0.02\n0.04\nAdd: Impact of hurricane-related losses\n0.02\n—\nAdd: Impact of quarry dredge costs for specific event\n0.01\n—\nAdd: Impact of purchase accounting adjustments for inventory\n0.04\n—\nAdd: Impact of non-cash stock compensation expense\n0.13\n0.10\nAdd: Impact of acquisition-related costs\n0.16\n0.02\nAdd: Impact of officer transition expenses\n—\n0.03\nAdjusted income from continuing operations before income taxes\n0.25\n0.91\nLess: Normalized income tax expense (2)\n0.07\n0.23\nAdjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations per Diluted Share (non-GAAP)\n$\n0.18\n$\n0.68\n(1) Net loss per diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2018 excludes common stock equivalents of 0.1 million shares from our options and restricted stock as their impact is anti-dilutive based on the net loss for the period; however, these common stock equivalents are included in Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations per Diluted Share.\n(2) Assumes a normalized effective tax rate of 26% in both periods.\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment, plus proceeds from the disposals of property, plant and equipment, proceeds from disposal of businesses and insurance proceeds from property loss claims. We consider Adjusted Free Cash Flow to be an important indicator of our ability to service our debt and generate cash for acquisitions and other strategic investments. However, Adjusted Free Cash Flow is not intended to be used as an alternative to any measure of our liquidity in accordance with GAAP. The following table reconciles Adjusted Free Cash Flow to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, which is net cash provided by operating activities (in thousands).\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow Reconciliation\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n25,936\n$\n29,544\nLess: Purchases of property, plant and equipment\n(8,375)\n(10,718)\nAdd: Proceeds from the disposals of property, plant and equipment\n262\n485\nAdd: Proceeds from disposal of businesses\n72\n294\nAdd: Insurance proceeds from property loss claims\n1,634\n—\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP)\n$\n19,529\n$\n19,605\nNet Debt\nNet Debt is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Net Debt as total debt, including current maturities and capital lease obligations, less cash and cash equivalents. We believe that Net Debt is useful to investors as a measure of our financial position. We use Net Debt to monitor and compare our financial position from period to period. However, Net Debt is not intended to be used as an alternative to any measure of our financial position in accordance with GAAP. The following table reconciles Net Debt to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, which is total debt, including current maturities and capital lease obligations (in thousands).\nAs of\nAs of\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nNet Debt Reconciliation\nTotal debt, including current maturities and capital lease obligations\n$\n755,728\n$\n693,336\nLess: cash and cash equivalents\n36,616\n22,581\nNet Debt (non-GAAP)\n$\n719,112\n$\n670,755\nNet Debt to Total Adjusted EBITDA\nNet Debt to Total Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Net Debt to Total Adjusted EBITDA as Net Debt divided by Total Adjusted EBITDA for the applicable last twelve-month period. We define Total Adjusted EBITDA as our income (loss) from continuing operations, excluding the impact of income tax expense (benefit), depreciation, depletion and amortization, net interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, derivative (income) loss, non-cash change in value of contingent consideration, impairment of goodwill and other assets, hurricane-related losses, quarry dredge costs for specific event, purchase accounting adjustments for inventory, foreign currency losses resulting from Polaris acquisition, non-cash stock compensation expense, acquisition-related costs and officer transition expenses. We believe that Net Debt to Total Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors as a measure of our financial position. We use this measure to monitor and compare our financial position from period to period. However, Net Debt to Total Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be used as an alternative to any measure of our financial position in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents our calculation of Net Debt to Total Adjusted EBITDA and the most directly comparable GAAP ratio, which is total debt to last twelve months (\"LTM\") income from continuing operations (in thousands).\nTwelve Month Period\nApril 1, 2017 to\nMarch 31, 2018\nTotal Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\nIncome from continuing operations\n$\n15,448\nAdd: Income tax expense\n7,386\nIncome from continuing operations before income taxes\n22,834\nAdd: Depreciation, depletion and amortization\n72,514\nAdd: Interest expense, net\n43,124\nAdd: Loss on extinguishment of debt\n60\nAdd: Derivative loss\n2,647\nAdd: Non-cash change in value of contingent consideration\n7,670\nAdd: Impairment of goodwill and other assets\n6,238\nAdd: Hurricane-related losses\n3,345\nAdd: Quarry dredge costs for specific event\n3,581\nAdd: Purchase accounting adjustments for inventory\n1,993\nAdd: Foreign currency losses resulting from Polaris acquisition\n1,949\nAdd: Non-cash stock compensation expense\n8,838\nAdd: Acquisition-related costs\n12,258\nAdd: Officer transition expenses\n200\nTotal Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n187,251\nNet Debt\n$\n719,112\nTotal debt to LTM income from continuing operations\n48.92x\nNet Debt to Total Adjusted EBITDA as of March 31, 2018 (non-GAAP)\n3.84x\nSource: USCR-E\nContact:\nU.S. Concrete, Inc.
