    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said on Monday France will contribute 50 million euros ($61.9 million) toward urgent humanitarian aid for Syria following a meeting with a group of non-governmental organizations (NGO) in Paris.\nFILE PHOTO: Internally displaced Syrians from eastern Ghouta queue for food in Herjelleh shelter in Damascus countryside, Syria, April 15, 2018. REUTERS/Ali Hashisho “This evening I brought together NGOs working on the ground in Syria. Faced with the humanitarian situation, France is setting up an emergency program of 50 million euros,” Macron said on his official Twitter account.\nThe funds will be allocated to NGOs and U.N. agencies working on the ground in Syria, including the U.N. office for humanitarian affairs, the French president’s office said.\nSome two dozens NGOs participated in the meeting with Macron at the Elysee presidential palace, including Action Aid, Handicap International, the Red Cross, and Care.\nAccording to United Nations estimates, some 13 million people including six million children are in need of humanitarian aid in Syria, ravaged by a seven-year war that has displaced millions.\nThe United Nations said on Thursday that it was hopeful of getting aid to at least 100,000 Syrians who are desperate for help after months of battle ended years of siege around the rebel-held enclave of eastern Ghouta.\nReporting by Marine Pennetier; Writing by Bate Felix; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ",
