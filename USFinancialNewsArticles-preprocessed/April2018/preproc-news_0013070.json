    "text": "MELBOURNE, April 9 (Reuters) - London aluminium rallied two percent on Monday and is expected to rise further on concerns that sanctions by the United States on aluminium giant Rusal could hamper trade in some seven percent of the world's annual supply of the metal. The United States on Friday imposed sanctions against Russian businessmen, companies and government officials, striking at associates of President Vladimir Putin in one of Washington's most aggressive moves to punish Moscow for a range of activities. Shares of United Company Rusal Plc fell 31 percent in Hong Kong on Monday after it was included in the new list. \"Market concerns have that the sanction against Rusal and its own technical default assessment may lead to supply shortage in both aluminium and alumina,\" said Hong Kong broker Argonaut in a report. Rusal produced some 3.7 million tonnes of aluminium in 2017, about 7 percent of the world's total, Argonaut said. Its annual alumina production of 11.5 million tonnes was also about 7 percent of the global total, while it produced about 4 percent of the world's bauxite, the broker said. \"It is expected that (the aluminium price rise) will extend further,\" Argonaut said. FUNDAMENTALS * ALUMINIUM: London Metal Exchange aluminium rallied 2 percent to $2,082.0 a tonne by 0304 GMT, adding to a 1.6 percent gain on Friday and taking prices to the highest since March 22.
