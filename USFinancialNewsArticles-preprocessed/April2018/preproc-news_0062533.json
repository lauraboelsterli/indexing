    "text": "HAMMOND, La., April 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FPB Financial Corp. (OTCQB:FPBF), the holding for Florida Parishes Bank, announced financial results for the 2018 period ended March 31, 2018.\nEarnings\nNet Income in the 2018 first quarter increased 170% to a record of $1,267,000 ($0.44 per fully diluted common share) as compared to the 2017 first quarter net income of $468,000 ($0.23 per fully diluted common share). Annualized return on average common equity (ROE) for the 3 months ended March 31, 2018 increased to 12.2%\nThe increase in net income during the 2018 first quarter was primarily attributed to a $975,000, or 30%, increase in net-interest income. The increase in net-interest income was primarily due to a 33% increase in mortgage loan interest income and a 28% increase in interest income from investment securities and deposits. Net income was positively affected by a $63,000, or 7% increase in Non-Interest Income. Non-Interest Income increased primarily due to a $91,000 increase in service charges on deposits, a $74,000 increase in SBA Fee Income offset by a $64,000 decreasing in mortgage banking fees, and a $69,000 loss on sale of foreclosed assets. Total consolidated non-interest expenses declined, by $98,000, or 3% in the 2018 period.\nRevenue (defined as net-interest income and total non-interest income) in the 2018 first quarter increased to $4.6 million, or 23% when compared to the 2017 period. Pre-provision for loan losses, pre-income tax expense – net income in the 3 months ended March 31, 2018 increased to $1.7 million, or 124% when compared to the 2017 period. The Company’s Net-Interest Margin increased in the 2018 first quarter to 4.45% from 4.35% in the 2017 period. The Efficiency Ratio improved to 62.4% in the 2018 period.\nWhile the Company’s effective income tax rate decreased to 20.7% in the 2018 period, Income Tax expense increased by $151,000, or 85% in the period as compared to 2017.\nBalance Sheet and Capital\nTotal assets at March 31, 2018 increased 19% to $365.5 million when compared to March 31, 2017. The increase in total assets was primarily due to a 39% increase in net loans over the twelve month period to $226.2 million. Total Liabilities increased 21% over the period. Deposits were the primary component of these increases with total deposits of $305.8 million at March 31, 2018, an increase of 19% of which $82.7 million were Non-Interest Bearing, which represents an increase of 21% from March 31, 2017.\nThe Company’s increase in total assets were affected by a 54% decrease in Cash and Cash Equivalents to $16.7 million, an increase of 17% in Investment Securities to $100.5 million and a 95% increase in deferred tax assets to $664,000. The increase in total liabilities were affected by a $7.2 million, or 82% increase in Federal Home Loan Bank advances and a $3.1 million reduction/payoff of Subordinated Debentures/Trust Preferred Securities.\nTotal loans increased to $230.7 million at March 31, 2018.
