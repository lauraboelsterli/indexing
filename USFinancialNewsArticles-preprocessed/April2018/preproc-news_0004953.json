    "text": "April 3, 2018 / 2:53 PM / Updated 6 minutes ago Pfizer in talks with P&G for consumer health unit sale: CNBC Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc is in talks with Procter & Gamble Co P&G.N for a sale of the U.S. drugmakerâ€™s consumer health business, CNBC reported on Tuesday, citing sources. The Pfizer logo is seen at their world headquarters in Manhattan, New York, U.S., August 1, 2016. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly \nThe companies were far apart on a price for the business, according to the report. \nPfizer is considering other options, including a joint venture with other drugmakers, CNBC said. \nPfizer and P&G could not be immediately reached for comment. \nGlaxoSmithKline, Reckitt Benckiser and Johnson & Johnson have all exited from the bidding process, endangering an auction Pfizer hoped would bring in as much as $20 billion \n(Corrects paragraph 3 to say Pfizer is considering options with other drugmakers, not with P&G) Reporting by Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila",
