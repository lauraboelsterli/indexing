    "text": "ORLANDO, Fla., April 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hemispherx Biopharma, Inc. (NYSE American:HEB), focused on immuno-pharmaceutical research and the commercial development of its immunology products Ampligen® and Alferon®, announced its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net loss was approximately $8,259,000 or $0.29 per share compared to a net loss of $7,502,000 or $0.34 per share for the same 12-month period in 2016. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were approximately $2,107,000 at December 31, 2017, compared to $5,868,000 as of December 31, 2016.\nSince December 31, 2017, Hemispherx has grossed $7,730,000 from Ampligen (rintatolimod) product revenue, the sale of non-strategic real estate, conversion of warrants, and the sale of common stock. With these proceeds it paid off its mortgage in the amount of $1,956,803.\nThe company accomplished many set milestones in 2017 towards its goal of long term revenue. Most importantly, it initiated a commercial scale production plan for Ampligen with its primary contract manufacturer to meet anticipated future demands in both international programs as well as domestic programs with the first lot of Ampligen expected for sale in the 2nd quarter of 2018. In addition:\nThe company delivered the first lot of Ampligen for sale in Europe utilizing the Early Access Program (EAP). The company amended its agreement with myTomorrows to treat pancreatic cancer patients beginning in the Netherlands utilizing EAP. The FDA approved a price increase for US-based Ampligen cost recovery program. The company is collaborating with Millions Missing Canada to bring medication to Canadians for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The company commenced data analysis of an intranasal human safety study of Ampligen plus FluMist®. Top line results show intranasal Ampligen was generally well-tolerated. Continuing discussions with FDA to identify a path toward approval for Ampligen for ME/CFS.\nThe Company is looking forward to continuing to accomplish many more milestones in 2018 and to increase its revenues from $437,000 in 2017.\nA bout Hemispherx Biopharma\nHemispherx Biopharma, Inc., is an advanced specialty pharmaceutical company engaged in the clinical development of new drug entities for treatment of seriously debilitating disorders.
