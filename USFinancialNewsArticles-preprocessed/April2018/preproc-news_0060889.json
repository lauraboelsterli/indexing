Former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf speaks during a Reuters interview in Kigali, Rwanda April 28, 2018. REUTERS/Jean Bizimana\nWithout naming specific countries or leaders, she referred to “laggard” countries in the region of one billion people who are “not meeting democratic transformation”.\n“Their own citizens are making the call for change and I don’t think they can continue to resist or deny that call for change,” Johnson Sirleaf told Reuters after accepting the award in Rwanda’s capital Kigali.\nLong-serving African leaders who have changed the law to stay in power include Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, 73, and Cameroon’s President Paul Biya, in power for 35 years.\nJohnson Sirleaf was awarded the 2017 Mo Ibrahim award, designed to improve the quality of African political leadership, after handing over power in her West African country’s first peaceful democratic transition in seven decades.\n“The pressure builds (for democracy),” she said. “The young people today are educated, skilful, demanding, and eventually we have to listen and I think that will happen to all those that are still lagging behind.” Former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf attends a Reuters interview in Kigali, Rwanda April 28, 2018. REUTERS/Jean Bizimana\nAfrica’s first elected female head of state, and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Johnson Sirleaf stepped down as president of war-scarred Liberia last month, making way for ex-international soccer star George Weah.\nShe is only the fifth person to win 10-year-old Ibrahim Prize for Achievement in African Leadership, founded by Sudanese telecoms tycoon Mo Ibrahim, which has several times not been awarded for lack of a suitable candidate.\nThe prize is $5 million paid out over 10 years, with another $200,000 annually throughout the winner’s lifetime.\nJohnson Sirleaf, a former World Bank and United Nations official, said this was unsurprising because many African nations do not meet the Foundation’s high standards. Former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf speaks during a Reuters interview in Kigali, Rwanda April 28, 2018. REUTERS/Jean Bizimana\n“Democracy is now moving at a fast pace but it hasn’t got everybody yet,” she said in an interview.\n“And even in stated democracies there is not enough ... democracy in the sense of full competition, full support for those that have been marginalised from the political scene.”\nBut Africa continues to change.\nIn Burkina Faso, Blaise Compaore was ousted by protests in 2014 after he tried to amend the constitution to extend his decades-long rule, while Gambia’s ruler Yahya Jammeh fled after regional pressure ended his 22-year reign last year.\nJohnson Sirleaf said she was optimistic about recent transfers of power on the continent.\nEarlier this month, Ethiopia swore in a new prime minister after Hailemariam Desalegn quit to clear the way for reforms.\nIn Zimbabwe, 94-year-old Robert Mugabe stood down as president in November, after the army and former political allies turned against him, ending nearly four decades of rule marred by allegations of corruption, human rights abuses and economic negligence.\nZimbabwe is due to hold elections in July.\nJohnson Sirleaf defended her record in Liberia, saying her much-criticised efforts to fight corruption were hindered by a “culture” of graft “developed for many years of deprivation through conflict.”.
