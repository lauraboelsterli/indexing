And that's just the beginning. First quarter earnings season is now in full swing. The street is expecting a record season.\nCNBC's Jim Cramer helped callers quell their fears about a few key stocks.\nU.S. Steel :\nThe company posts earnings on Thursday. But Cramer said he wouldn't be a buyer of the steel play. \"We like Nucor ,\" he said on \" Mad Money \" Wednesday.\nBall Corporation :\n\"I think Ball's a big winner,\" Cramer said, pointing out that in the can industry, there are not a lot of players.\nTeva Pharmaceuticals :\n\"Not good enough,\" Cramer said, comparing it with other drug companies. Better to pass, he said.\nCME Group :\nCramer said it's an \"ideal stock\" in the current environment of volatility and is well-run.\nAqua America :\nCramer said in the current hot economy, this is not the stock to buy, despite it also being a well-run company.\nMcDonald's :\nThe stock is currently cheap. Cramer said yes â€” for now. \"Buy half,\" he said, \"then wait.\"\nMueller Water Products :\nCramer said he doesn't like the number. \"This is not the time to buy,\" he said.\n Nucor.\n ",
