Noninterest expenses increased $4.44 million or 10.79% from the first quarter of 2017 (increased 10.41% excluding leased equipment depreciation).\nSOUTH BEND, Ind.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 1st Source Corporation (NASDAQ: SRCE), parent company of 1st Source Bank, today reported a record high net income of $19.12 million for the first quarter of 2018, an improvement of 17.96% compared to $16.21 million reported in the first quarter a year ago. Income before taxes was $25.00 million compared to $24.92 million in the first quarter of 2017. The pretax income comparison was positively impacted by increased net interest income of $6.81 million primarily due to rising lending rates, higher average loan and lease balances and the recognition of a $0.62 million unaccreted purchase discount from an early loan payoff. These positives were offset by a $2.79 million increase in the provision for loan and lease losses to support loan and lease growth and a $4.44 million rise in noninterest expense. Non-recurring first quarter 2018 costs were approximately $1.60 million.\nDiluted net income per common share for the first quarter of 2018 was a record high $0.73, versus $0.62 in the first quarter of 2017.\nAt its April 2018 meeting, the Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.24 per common share, up 9.09% from $0.22 per common share in the prior quarter and up 26.32% from the $0.19 per common share declared a year ago. The cash dividend is payable to shareholders of record on May 7, 2018 and will be paid on May 15, 2018.\nAccording to Christopher J. Murphy III, Chairman, “1st Source Corporation had a strong first quarter and crested $6 billion in asset size. We continue to achieve steady net income and see healthy growth in loans, leases, and deposits. Credit quality remains favorable with year-to-date net charge-offs of only $338,000 or 0.03% of average loans and leases. Average loans and leases were up a strong 9.59% for the quarter compared to the same period last year. Average deposits were also up a solid 9.52% from this time last year. Net interest income has increased 15.56% from the first quarter 2017, along with noninterest income increasing 2.15%. Noninterest expenses increased 10.79% from the same quarter of 2017.”\n“We have started out 2018 with strong loan growth. As we move deeper into the year, we will continue our focus on organic, core deposit growth to support further loan growth,” added Murphy.\n“As always, our mission each day is to help our clients achieve security, build wealth and realize their dreams. We are looking forward to carrying out this mission for the rest of 2018,” Murphy concluded.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 FINANCIAL RESULTS\nLoans\nAverage loans and leases of $4.59 billion increased $401.55 million, up 9.59% in the first quarter of 2018 from the year ago quarter and have increased $141.99 million, up 3.19% from the fourth quarter of 2017.\nDeposits\nAverage deposits of $4.71 billion grew $409.48 million, up 9.52% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from the year ago quarter and have increased $22.29 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nFirst quarter 2018 net interest income of $50.53 million increased $6.81 million, up 15.56% from the first quarter of 2017 and increased $1.72 million, up 3.52% from the fourth quarter of 2017.\nFirst quarter 2018 net interest margin was 3.69%, an improvement of 20 basis points from the 3.49% for the same period in 2017 and increased 12 basis points from the fourth quarter. First quarter 2018 net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis was 3.71%, an increase of 18 basis points from the 3.53% for the same period in 2017 and increased 10 basis points from the fourth quarter.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income for the first quarter of 2018 was $23.81 million, up $0.50 million or 2.15% from the year ago quarter, and down $1.86 million or 7.26% from the fourth quarter. The growth in noninterest income during the first quarter compared to the same period a year ago was mainly due to higher equipment rental income resulting from an increase in the average lease portfolio, improved debit card income due to growth in those transactions, higher customer swap fees and increased trust and wealth advisory fees, which were offset by reduced gains on the sale of available-for-sale equity securities.\nThe reduction in noninterest income from the fourth quarter was primarily the result of lower gains on the sale of available-for-sale equity securities, decreased equipment rental income and reduced customer swap fees offset by the receipt of insurance contingent commissions.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $45.56 million, up $4.44 million or 10.79% over the comparable period a year ago and down $1.76 million or 3.71% from the fourth quarter. Excluding depreciation on leased equipment, noninterest expenses were up $3.69 million or 10.41% from the first quarter a year ago. The increase in noninterest expense from the same quarter a year ago was primarily due to higher salary expense as a result of normal merit increases and a rise in incentive compensation and higher depreciation on leased equipment as the lease portfolio grew. In addition, non-recurring first quarter 2018 costs were approximately $1.60 million due to consulting fees for a customer relationship management project and information technology projects of $0.70 million, a repossessed asset valuation adjustment of $0.60 million, and trust losses of $0.30 million.\nThe reduction in noninterest expense from the fourth quarter of 2017 was mainly due to reduced charitable contributions, a decrease in provision for unfunded loan commitments, and lower general collection and repossession expenses offset by increased valuation adjustments on repossessed assets.\nCredit\nThe reserve for loan and lease losses as of March 31, 2018 was 2.10% of total loans and leases compared to 2.10% at December 31, 2017 and 2.13% at March 31, 2017. Net charge-offs of $0.34 million were recorded for the first quarter of 2018 compared with net recoveries of $0.58 million in the same quarter a year ago and down from the $2.11 million of net charge-offs in the fourth quarter.\nThe provision for loan and lease losses for the first quarter of 2018 increased $2.79 million from the same quarter a year ago and increased slightly from the fourth quarter.\nThe ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and leases was 0.74% as of March 31, 2018, compared to the 0.63% on March 31, 2017 and the 0.67% on December 31, 2017.\nCapital\nAs of March 31, 2018, the common equity-to-assets ratio was 11.99%, compared to 12.20% at December 31, 2017 and 12.47% a year ago. The tangible common equity-to-tangible assets ratio was 10.75% at March 31, 2018 and 10.94% at December 31, 2017 compared to 11.11% a year earlier. The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, calculated under banking regulatory guidelines, was 12.22% at March 31, 2018 compared to 12.35% at December 31, 2017 and 12.69% a year ago.\nABOUT 1ST SOURCE CORPORATION\n1st Source common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under “SRCE” and appears in the National Market System tables in many daily newspapers under the code name “1st Src.” Since 1863, 1st Source has been committed to the success of the communities it serves.

Readers are advised that various important factors could cause 1st Source’s actual results or circumstances for future periods to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in such forward-looking statements. Such factors, among others, include changes in laws, regulations or accounting principles generally accepted in the United States; 1st Source’s competitive position within its markets served; increasing consolidation within the banking industry; unforeseen changes in interest rates; unforeseen downturns in the local, regional or national economies or in the industries in which 1st Source has credit concentrations; and other risks discussed in 1st Source’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K, which filings are available from the SEC. 1st Source undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe accounting and reporting policies of 1st Source conform to generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States and prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, certain non-GAAP performance measures are used by management to evaluate and measure the Company’s performance. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a financial institution, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. These include taxable-equivalent net interest income (including its individual components), net interest margin (including its individual components), the efficiency ratio, tangible common equity-to-tangible assets ratio and tangible book value per common share. Management believes that these measures provide users of the Company’s financial information a more meaningful view of the performance of the interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and of the Company’s operating efficiency. Other financial holding companies may define or calculate these measures differently.\nManagement reviews yields on certain asset categories and the net interest margin of the Company and its banking subsidiaries on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. In this non-GAAP presentation, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt interest income on an equivalent before-tax basis. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. Net interest income on a FTE basis is also used in the calculation of the Company’s efficiency ratio. The efficiency ratio, which is calculated by dividing non-interest expense by total taxable-equivalent net revenue (less securities gains or losses and lease depreciation), measures how much it costs to produce one dollar of revenue. Securities gains or losses and lease depreciation are excluded from this calculation to better match revenue from daily operations to operational expenses. Management considers the tangible common equity-to-tangible assets ratio and tangible book value per common share as useful measurements of the Company’s equity.\nSee the table marked “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of certain non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company with their most closely related GAAP measures.\n(charts attached)\n1st SOURCE CORPORATION 1st QUARTER 2018 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (Unaudited - Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Three Months Ended March 31, December 31, March 31, 2018 2017 2017 AVERAGE BALANCES Assets $ 5,939,574 $ 5,818,837 $ 5,437,247 Earning assets 5,552,779 5,418,305 5,075,410 Investments 916,979 884,209 839,283 Loans and leases 4,588,782 4,446,794 4,187,231 Deposits 4,708,439 4,686,145 4,298,964 Interest bearing liabilities 4,154,214 3,985,709 3,747,752 Common shareholders’ equity 726,242 719,058 683,647 INCOME STATEMENT DATA Net interest income $ 50,532 $ 48,814 $ 43,727 Net interest income - FTE (1) 50,744 49,249 44,188 Provision for loan and lease losses 3,786 3,622 1,000 Noninterest income 23,807 25,671 23,307 Noninterest expense 45,557 47,313 41,119 Net income 19,116 17,994 16,206 PER SHARE DATA Basic net income per common share $ 0.73 $ 0.69 $ 0.62 Diluted net income per common share 0.73 0.69 0.62 Common cash dividends declared 0.22 0.20 0.18 Book value per common share 27.96 27.70 26.46 Tangible book value per common share (1) 24.72 24.47 23.22 Market value - High 54.65 53.29 49.11 Market value - Low 48.26 47.16 42.15 Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 25,950,386 25,936,508 25,903,397 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 25,950,386 25,936,508 25,903,397 KEY RATIOS Return on average assets 1.31 % 1.23 % 1.21 % Return on average common shareholders’ equity 10.67 9.93 9.61 Average common shareholders’ equity to average assets 12.23 12.36 12.57 End of period tangible common equity to tangible assets (1) 10.75 10.94 11.11 Risk-based capital - Common Equity Tier 1 (2) 12.22 12.35 12.69 Risk-based capital - Tier 1 (2) 13.29 13.44 13.88 Risk-based capital - Total (2) 14.54 14.70 15.18 Net interest margin 3.69 3.57 3.49 Net interest margin - FTE (1) 3.71 3.61 3.53 Efficiency ratio: expense to revenue 61.28 63.52 61.34 Efficiency ratio: expense to revenue - adjusted (1) 57.47 60.09 57.81 Net charge offs (recoveries) to average loans and leases 0.03 0.19 (0.06 ) Loan and lease loss reserve to loans and leases 2.10 2.10 2.13 Nonperforming assets to loans and leases 0.74 0.67 0.63 March 31, December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, 2018 2017 2017 2017 2017 END OF PERIOD BALANCES Assets $ 6,051,463 $ 5,887,284 $ 5,806,735 $ 5,687,230 $ 5,501,526 Loans and leases 4,691,097 4,527,678 4,436,718 4,381,314 4,234,862 Deposits 4,781,325 4,752,730 4,573,712 4,482,036 4,336,976 Reserve for loan and lease losses 98,331 94,883 93,372 91,914 90,118 Goodwill and intangible assets 84,124 83,742 83,795 83,848 83,960 Common shareholders’ equity 725,609 718,537 710,497 699,202 685,934 ASSET QUALITY Loans and leases past due 90 days or more $ 123 $ 459 $ 208 $ 178 $ 344 Nonaccrual loans and leases 25,360 19,405 15,066 15,923 18,090 Other real estate 1,184 1,312 1,341 710 916 Repossessions 9,432 10,114 12,913 13,052 8,121 Equipment owned under operating leases 2 9 14 21 27 Total nonperforming assets $ 36,101 $ 31,299 $ 29,542 $ 29,884 $ 27,498 (1) See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information on this performance measure/ratio.
