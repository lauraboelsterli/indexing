    "text": "April 12, 2018 / 7:44 PM / Updated 13 minutes ago U.S. actors' union calls for end to meetings in private hotel rooms Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nLOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The United States’ largest actors’ union on Thursday called for an end to auditions and professional meetings in private hotel rooms and residences to protect its members from “potential harassment or exploitation.” FILE PHOTO: 24th Screen Actors Guild Awards – Show – Los Angeles, California, U.S., 21/01/2018 – Actress Gabrielle Carteris speaks on stage. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni \nSAG-AFTRA President Gabrielle Carteris said in a statement posted on the union’s website, “We are committed to addressing the scenario that has allowed predators to exploit performers behind closed doors under the guise of a professional meeting.” \nDozens of high-profile men have been fired or have resigned from their jobs in politics, media, entertainment and business after facing accusations of sexual misconduct. \nThe addition to the union’s Code of Conduct also urged its more than 150,000 members and their representatives not to agree to meetings in private settings. The union said absent a “reasonable alternative to having the meeting in such a location” a “support peer” should also attend the meeting. Reporting by Eric Kelsey",
