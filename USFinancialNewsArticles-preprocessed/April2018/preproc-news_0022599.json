    "text": "HAMBURG (Reuters) - Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) has joined easyJet ( EZJ.L ) in expressing interest in struggling Italian carrier Alitalia [CAITLA.UL], the airlines said on Tuesday.\nFILE PHOTO: People walk in the Alitalia departure hall at Fiumicino international airport in Rome, Italy July 24, 2015. REUTERS/Max Rossi EasyJet said it has submitted a revised expression of interest for a restructured Alitalia as part of a consortium, declining to provide further details.\nRelated Coverage Air France-KLM says has no interest in bidding for Alitalia\nFILE PHOTO: Flags with the German airline Lufthansa sign flutter next to the office building in Frankfurt, Germany March 15, 2018. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski Lufthansa then said it has submitted a document setting out its ideas for a “new” Alitalia. “We can imagine further talks being held on this basis,” a spokesman said.\nAlitalia said it had received three bids.\nGermany-based Lufthansa had previously said it would only be interested in a restructured Alitalia.\nAlitalia entered insolvency proceedings last year and the Italian government has since been seeking new investors. The sale process has been delayed as a result of last month’s elections.\nBloomberg News, citing a source, reported that easyJet ( EZJ.L ) is teaming up with private equity firm Cerberus and Air France-KLM for its bid for Alitalia, but Air France-KLM said it had no interest in bidding.\n“Air France-KLM denies any interest to do a bid on Alitalia,” a spokeswoman for the Franco-Dutch group said by email when asked about the report.\nReporting by Victoria Bryan, Tim Hepher, Agnieszka Flak, editing by Larry King and Sandra Maler\n ",
