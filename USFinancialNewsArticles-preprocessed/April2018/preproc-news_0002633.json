    "text": "Newcomer outfielders Christian Yelich and Lorenzo Cain combined for eight hits, four runs scored and four RBIs Saturday night and third baseman Travis Shaw added three RBIs as the Milwaukee Brewers defeated the host San Diego Padres 7-3 at Petco Park to complete a sweep of their three-game, season-opening series.\nYelich, whom the Brewers acquired from Florida in a trade during the offseason, went 5-for-5 with a double, three runs scored and two RBIs. It was the second five-hit game of Yelich’s career.\nCain, a free-agent signee, was 3-for-4 with a stolen base, a run scored and three RBIs. Cain was 8-for-14 with three doubles and three stolen bases in his first series back as a Brewer.\nShaw was 2-for-4 with a double and three RBIs\nMilwaukee opened the season with three straight wins for the first time since 2006.\nThe Brewers scored one run in the first and two runs in both the third and fourth innings off Padres starter and loser Luis Perdomo (0-1). The right-hander gave up the five runs on seven hits and four walks in four innings. Their final two runs came off reliever Robbie Erlin in the eighth.\nThe Padres took a brief 2-1 lead in the second on a triple by right fielder Hunter Renfroe and a two-run homer by shortstop Freddy Galvis. They then tied the game in the bottom of the third on back-to-back, two-out doubles by Jose Pirela and Eric Hosmer.\nBut Milwaukee starting pitcher Brent Suter and relievers Josh Hader, Matt Albers and Jacob Barnes held the Padres scoreless on two hits — singles by Erlin in the fifth and Hosmer in the ninth — over the final 6 1/3 innings. Brewers pitchers ended the game by retiring 18 of the last 20 hitters they faced, including a double play.\nSuter held the Padres to three runs on five hits and a walk with four strikeouts over five innings to get the win. Hader retired all six Padres he face with four strikeouts.\nThe Brewers return home Monday to start a run of 10 straight games against National League Central rivals St. Louis and the Chicago Cubs. The Padres next host the Colorado Rockies for a four-game series.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
