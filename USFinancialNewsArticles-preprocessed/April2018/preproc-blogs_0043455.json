    "text": "RIYADH (Reuters) - The administrative chief of Houthi-controlled northern Yemen was killed in a Saudi-led coalition air raid last week, Houthi-run television reported on Monday.\nFILE PHOTO: Saleh al-Sumad, the head of Yemen's Houthi movement's politburo, delivers a speech at a ceremony during which a political council to rule the country was announced in Sanaa, Yemen August 6, 2016. REUTERS/Khaled Abdullah/File Photo Saleh al-Samad was the most senior Houthi official to be killed by the coalition since it intervened in Yemen’s civil war in 2015 to try and push back the Houthis after they drove the internationally-recognized government into exile in Riyadh.\nThe Houthis’ al-Masirah TV said Samad was killed on Thursday in Hodeidah province. There was no immediate comment from the coalition.\nSamad was second on the coalition’s most wanted list of Houthi leaders, after the group’s leader Abdel-Malek al-Houthi. The coalition had offered a $20 million reward for any information that led to Samad’s capture, according to Saudi-owned broadcaster al-Arabiya TV.\nThe death of Samad, the group’s Ansarullah political council chief, dealt a big blow to the Houthis in a three-year-old war that has killed more than 10,000 people and unleashed the world’s most urgent humanitarian crisis.\nAl-Masirah reported that the Houthis had appointed Mahdi al-Mashat, previously director of Abdel Malek al-Houthi’s office, to replace Samad.\nThe coalition says the Houthis are armed and supported by Saudi arch-adversary Iran - charges the group and Tehran deny.\nThe coalition has carried out thousands of air strikes in Yemen that have hit schools, markets and hospitals, killing hundreds of people - though it says it does not target civilians.\nReporting by Sarah Dadouch, Marwa Rashad and Mohammed Ghobari; editing by Mark Heinrich\n 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
