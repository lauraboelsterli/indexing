Additionally, interest income from loans and investment securities increased from the same quarter in the prior year by 14% and 15%, respectively.”\nCEO John M. Jelavich commented, “We are pleased with our record quarterly earnings and nearly 12% return on equity we achieved in the first quarter of 2018. Our core deposits as well as loans have shown solid growth over the past year and we continue to remain encouraged by the momentum we have established in our markets. While new loan volume has been a bit slow to start the year, we have seen recent strength in our pipeline and expect loan growth to occur over the balance of the year. Our strong efficiency ratio and balance sheet position us favorably to remain competitive in our markets while also generating solid returns for our shareholders.”\nThe Bank is rated \"5-Star Superior\" by Bauer Financial and serves its customer base through its offices located at:\n1629 Colusa Avenue, Yuba City, CA 426 Sutton Way, Grass Valley, CA\nThe Bank offers a full suite of competitive products, services, and banking technology.
