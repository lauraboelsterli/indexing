LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) SGX Nifty nearest-month futures at 10,443.50, up 0.3% from its previous close. The Indian rupee is likely to weaken against the dollar today as crude oil prices rally amid the possibility of a U.S. military strike on Syria. Indian government bonds are likely to fall in early trade tracking further gains in crude oil prices, that may boost domestic inflation going ahead. The yield on the 7.17 percent bond maturing in 2028 is likely to trade in a 7.53 percent-7.58 percent band today, a trader with a private bank said. The note closed at 97.49 rupees, lowest since Mar. 26, yielding 7.54 percent, yesterday. GLOBAL MARKETS • Wall Street stocks fell on Wednesday as possible U.S. military action against Syria stoked investor concerns about geopolitical risk to the American economy and minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee sparked worries about a more hawkish view on interest-rate increases. • Asian stocks came under pressure as the threat of imminent U.S. military action in Syria rattled investors and sent oil prices to their highest levels since late 2014 on concerns about supply. • The dollar struggled against the yen as investors sought shelter in the safe-haven Japanese currency on concerns over the possibility of Western military action against Syria. • U.S. Treasury yields declined on escalating geopolitical tensions after President Donald Trump warned Russia of imminent military action in Syria over a suspected poison gas attack. • Oil markets remained tense on concerns of a military escalation in Syria, although prices remained some way off Wednesday's highest since late 2014 as bulging American supplies weighed. • Gold prices eased off multi-week highs as minutes from the Federal Reserves's last policy meeting raised expectations for a faster pace of U.S. rate hikes.
