    "text": "9:42 AM ET Thu, 26 April 2018 | 01:59\nFacebook opened more than 8 percent higher a day after reporting better-than-expected first quarter earnings.\nShares opened at $173.22 Thursday after closing Wednesday below $160. That puts Facebook on pace for it's best day since January 2016.\nFacebook beat on both the top and bottom lines , quelling concerns about a diminishing user base and margin compression â€” at least for now.\nFacebook has been battling reports of online abuse, government probes and concerns around user privacy.\nThe company's stock has lost tens of billions of dollars in shareholder value since initial reports of massive data mishandling by research firm Cambridge Analytica.\nWith Thursday's surge, the stock is down just 2 percent on the year.\nIt's roughly 11 percent off its 52-week high, having clawed its way back from bear market territory earlier this month.
