    "text": "LA JOLLA, Calif., Private Bancorp of America, Inc. (OTCQX:PBAM)\nPBAM announced that its Bank has successfully completed the rebranding from San Diego Private Bank and Divisions to CalPrivate Bank effective March 21, 2018. PBAM’s President and CEO, Thomas V. Wornham said “We continue to operate as one company throughout our expanded footprint, now under one sign, CalPrivate Bank. We remain headquartered in La Jolla, CA and continue to serve our clients with locations from Coronado to Beverly Hills. Our coastal southern California strategy has served us well. We are most appreciative to our clients, team members and partners who enabled us to make this transition so smoothly.”\nPBAM reported the financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. Below are some highlights comparing the Year over Year (YOY) comparison of Q1 2018 to Q1 2017:\nTotal Assets increased to $646,230,000, up 20% Total Net Loans increased to $471,635,000, up 13% Total Deposits increased to $504,606,000, up 21% Total Net Interest Income increased to $6,281,802, up 20% Total Non-Interest Expenses increased to $4,846,000, up 46% Net Income decreased to $1,129,000, down 16%\nThe income statement reflects net interest income growth continuing at healthy levels. As the attached tables indicate, our challenge remains building our non-interest income businesses. We are addressing this by revamping our SBA group and refocusing our bankers on the highly competitive Treasury Management Products we have developed.\nThe first quarter reflects continued investment in our organic growth strategy through expansion of our existing footprint and the addition of new talent. The increase in non-interest expense reflects the one-time cost of rebranding as well as investment in three key future revenue growth drivers. First, the addition of team members and team lift outs and the additional staff required to support them. This is a large part of the 38% increase in salary and benefit expense. Second, the addition and expansion of the Beverly Hills location and the relocation and expansion of our Newport location added to our occupancy and equipment expense. Third, increased volume has increased data processing costs.\nWhile we expect fixed costs to stabilize, the investment in people and business lines that are complementary to our core competencies and meet our clients’ needs will continue. The recent consolidation and merger activity in the markets we serve has presented us with unique opportunities to acquire seasoned, respected, driven and qualified talent. These new team members will provide us with greater calling and client service capabilities. The recent senior management additions have given us a deeper “succession Bench”. Like many other investments, full benefit and returns on our investments are expected to emerge over several quarters.\nOur strategy continues to be focused on organically growing through exceptional personnel recruitment, while reviewing merger and acquisition targets with the same disciplined approach we have in the past. Our philosophy remains targeting the markets we know; providing outstanding client experiences though highly qualified, client centric personnel and creative product solutions; resulting in superior shareholder returns.\nRELATIONSHIPS – SOLUTIONS - TRUST\nAbout Private Bancorp of America, Inc.\nPrivate Bancorp of America, Inc.
