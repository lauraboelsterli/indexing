(NASDAQ: CASS) , a leading provider of transportation, energy, telecom and waste invoice payment and information services, reported first quarter 2018 earnings of $.65 per diluted share, an increase of 28% from the $.51 per diluted share it earned in the first quarter of 2017. Net income for the period was a record $8.1 million, compared to $6.3 million in 2017.\nMarch 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 % Change Transportation Invoice Volume 9.1 million 8.4 million 9.7% Transportation Dollar Volume $6.8 billion $5.9 billion 15.6% Facility Expense Transaction Volume* 7.1 million 6.8 million 4.5% Facility Expense Dollar Volume* $3.4 billion $3.2 billion 8.3% Revenues $36.0 million $32.3 million 11.4% Net Income $8.1 million $6.3 million 28.3% Diluted Earnings Per Share $.65 $.51 27.5% *Includes Energy, Telecom and Waste\n2018 1st Quarter Recap\nAgainst the backdrop of a strengthening global economy, first quarter 2018 revenue increased 11% and net income increased 28%. Also driving the record performance was continued expansion of the customer base; the development, deployment and extension of new revenue-generating services; higher interest rates; and income tax reform. The solid bottom-line advances were achieved despite significant expenditures in new technology and infrastructure to support future service growth.\nHighlighting first quarter performance was a 16% increase in transportation dollar volume. Increased carrier and fuel prices combined with higher volume from current accounts to produce the notable result. Transportation invoice volume was also up 10% for the period.\nFacility-related (electricity, gas, waste and telecom expense management) dollar volume increased 8%. New customer wins, combined with increased volume from current accounts, fueled the increase. Facility expense transactions were also up 5% for the period.\nConsolidated operating expenses increased $1.9 million (8%) due mainly to on-going strategic investment in the technology and staff required to win and support new business.\n“We are thrilled to report the strongest quarterly results in company history,” stated Eric H. Brunngraber , Cass chairman and chief executive officer. “This exceptional performance was the result of successfully executing our growth strategy combined with the effects of a strong economy, improving interest rate environment and tax reform.”\nCash Dividend Declared\nOn April 24, 2018, the company’s board of directors declared a second quarter dividend of $.26 per share payable June 15, 2018 to shareholders of record June 5, 2018. The new quarterly dividend is two cents or 8% higher than the previous pay-out of 24 cents per share. Cass has continuously paid regularly scheduled cash dividends since 1934.\n“In authorizing a mid-year increase in the cash dividend, Cass directors again demonstrated their commitment to rewarding shareholders and optimism about the immediate and long-term prospects of the company,” said Brunngraber.\nAbout Cass Information Systems\nCass Information Systems, Inc. is a leading provider of integrated information and payment management solutions.
