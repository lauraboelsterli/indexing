    "text": "MONTREAL--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Castle Hall Diligence is pleased to announce that Dimitri Douaire has joined the firm as Director, RiskDiligence.\nDimitri brings close to 20 years of due diligence experience, with a focus on liquid alternatives. Prior to Castle Hall, Mr. Douaire served as Director, External Public Investment & Credit Group for OPTrust in Toronto, where he developed all aspects of the due diligence process pertaining to liquid alternative investment strategies.\nMr. Douaire’s addition to the Castle Hall team responds to investor demand for the firm’s unique RiskDiligence offering.\n“I’m excited to join the Castle Hall risk team,” said Mr. Douaire. “Castle Hall has identified a clear need in the marketplace to offer objective, independent risk due diligence across asset classes. The firm’s 'Diligence Only' model frees Castle Hall from the conflicts of interest which can arise in a traditional investment consulting model, where consultants typically recommend managers from a buy list.”\nCastle Hall does not source investments or recommend funds, creating a clear segregation of duties in the institutional investment process. Within this unconflicted model, Castle Hall can deliver consistent and unbiased analysis of each third-party manager’s investment team, process, strategy and risk management function.\nRiskDiligence is the evolution of Castle Hall’s partnership with SwissAnalytics, based in Zurich, Switzerland. After an initial strategic partnership in 2014, Castle Hall fully integrated the SwissAnalytics team and due diligence methodology within the Castle Hall diligence platform in January 2017.\n“Dimitri is an excellent addition to our team,” said Christian Nauer, CEO of SwissAnalytics. “RiskDiligence offers a differentiated approach which has been warmly received by a growing client base. In particular, instead of emphasizing reasons that may cause investment strategies to perform in line with expectations - or justify why a Manager is expected to outperform as a 'buy' recommendation - RiskDiligence is principally interested in reasons that could cause investment strategies to perform below expectations.”\nRiskDiligence serves three user cases.\nInvestment professionals use Castle Hall to generate a detailed due diligence report when a manager is proposed for investment, ensuring that each investment recommendation is supported with consistent and detailed analysis and documentation. Once invested, RiskMonitor enables investment professionals to move up the value chain and action exceptions to monthly and quarterly performance analysis, rather than focus on gathering raw risk information. Governance, risk and compliance professionals are empowered by the independent and objective data contained within each RiskDiligence report, which includes a detailed quantitative analysis of return drivers. For institutional Boards of Directors and Trustees, an independent and informed risk function helps discharge fiduciary obligations and meet regulatory requirements. Finally, fund directors can access RiskDiligence information – typically in combination with Castle Hall’s award winning OpsDiligence operational analysis – to support their obligations to provide effective oversight over the activities of pooled fund vehicles.\nAbout Castle Hall\nCastle Hall, a member of AIMA, helps global institutional investors, fund of funds, advisors, family offices and endowments identify and manage the business, operational, cyber and investment risks of asset managers. With a team of 50 professionals, Castle Hall deploys one of the industry’s largest and most experienced due diligence teams. Castle Hall’s core competitive advantage is DueDiligenceProfessional, the firm’s proprietary online diligence platform, which has helped clients review diligence across several thousand fund entities.\n //www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180405006361/en/\nCastle Hall Diligence\nDaryl Purdy, +1 450-465-8880 ext. 236\ndpurdy@castlehalldiligence.com\nSource: Castle Hall",
