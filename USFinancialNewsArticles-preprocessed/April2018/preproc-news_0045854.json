    "text": "Tampa, FL., April 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vector Solutions , the leader in industry-focused eLearning and SaaS performance support solutions, announced today it has acquired Convergence Training , a leading provider of training content and software solutions for industrial operations, manufacturing, and mining, specializing in 3D and animation . The acquisition solidifies Vector’s position as an innovator in training technology, strengthening its focus on skills-based training, expanding its portfolio of industry-specific solutions, and broadening the types of modernized content it can deliver to clients.\n“It’s our mission to create the most effective training to maximize learning and retention for optimized performance,” said Jeff Gordon, CEO of Vector Solutions. “And one of the best ways to engage learners is by leveraging cutting-edge educational technology like the 3D modeling used in Convergence courses. This type of media allows us to bring topics to life, convey complex information and processes, give rare looks inside machinery and other large items, and create scenarios that could otherwise risk safety. This is an important step as we work to modernize our entire course library and bring personalized instant intelligence to our clients.”\nConvergence serves over 50 Fortune 500 companies and has more than 400 clients including Caterpillar, Honeywell, LafargeHolcim, Microsoft and International Paper. Their course library includes 750 courses, many offered in 14 languages, on a broad range of subjects including health and safety, paper and pulping, corrugated packaging, power and utilities, mining, and HR.\n“Our two teams share a passion for innovation and driving results,” said Randy Kohltfarber, CEO of Convergence Training. “We could not be more excited to see what the synergy between us will bring to the future of training, both in the industrial space and other industries served by Vector. The reach and power behind their LMS, mobile technology and course library will better enable us to reach a wider audience with our 3D training while better serving our existing clients.”\nThe acquisition provides clients across Vector and Convergence with access to thousands of new courses in a variety of modern formats and includes content accredited by hundreds of licensing bodies and professional associations. Clients will also benefit from increased platform features and modules for optimized performance. Convergence Training products and solutions will be offered under Vector’s Commercial business unit, partnered with the RedVector brand.\nVector Solutions is focused on creating mobile, intelligent solutions that deliver real-time training to help optimize employee performance. The addition of 3D modeling comes as the company launches its first Virtual Reality training course for firefighters and also rolls out its first Augmented Reality prototype.\nFor additional information, please visit the Vector Solutions website and Newsroom.\nAbout Convergence Training\nConvergence Training is an award-winning producer of online training, training management software, and operational efficiency tools, specializing in 3D and animation content delivery.
