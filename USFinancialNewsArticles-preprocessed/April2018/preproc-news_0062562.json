(NASDAQ: CTWS) today announced that the Federal Trade Commission has granted early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, with respect to the companies’ merger of equals. The transaction, as previously announced on March 15, 2018, was unanimously approved by both companies’ boards of directors, and remains on track to close during the fourth quarter of 2018.\nUnder the terms of the companies’ agreement, Connecticut Water shareholders will receive 1.1375 shares of SJW Group common stock for each share of Connecticut Water common stock they own, the equivalent of $64.72 per share, based on SJW Group’s closing stock price as of April 25, 2018, the day SJW Group filed its Preliminary S-4 Proxy Statement and the day prior to when California Water Service announced its non-binding indication of interest.
