    "text": "April 13, 2018 / 10:03 AM / Updated 26 minutes ago U.S says Syria government was behind chemical weapon attack Steve Holland , Michelle Nichols 2 Min Read \nWASHINGTON/UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States on Friday blamed the Syrian government for a deadly chemical weapons attack this month and slammed Russia for failing to stop its ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. \nAs the prospect of U.S.-led military action that could lead to confrontation with Russia hung over the Middle East, the White House accused Syria of staging a toxic gas assault on April 7 that killed dozens of people in Douma, near Damascus. \n“We have a very high confidence that Syria was responsible and, once again, Russia’s failure to stop them and their continued (lack of action) on this front has been part of the problem,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said. \nU.S. intelligence shows a Russian claim that the attack was faked was false, Sanders said. “Our intelligence tells us otherwise. I can’t go beyond that,” she told reporters. Related Coverage",
