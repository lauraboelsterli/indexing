    "text": "TRIESTE, April 19 (Reuters) - The chairman of Assicurazioni Generali pledged the Italian insurer would liquidate its investments in the coal sector in 6 to 12 months after Greenpeace activists staged a protest on Thursday.\nProtesters hung a large banner on a building in the northern city of Trieste, where Generali’s annual general meeting was taking place, saying “Enough with insuring coal and climate changes”.\nEarlier on Thursday Generali said in a note its board had approved in February the sale of its equity investments in the coal sector and letting any debt holdings expire unless it sold it ahead of maturity.
