    "text": "Missiles hit an air base in Syria early Monday in a strike that Russia blamed on Israel, an assault that comes on the heels of an alleged chemical-weapons attack on a Damascus suburb that killed dozens of civilians and spurred calls for international action.\nAt least 14 military personnel were killed in the strike, including three Syrian commanders, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Four Iranians died in the attack, according to Iranâ€™s semiofficial Fars News Agency, which published their names and pictures.\n...
