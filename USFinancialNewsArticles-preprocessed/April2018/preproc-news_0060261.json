    "text": "TOPEKA, Kan., April 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Capitol Federal ® Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ: CFFN) (\"Capitol Federal\" or the \"Company\") announced today the acquisition of Capital City Bancshares, Inc. (\"CCB\") and results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Detailed results will be available in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on or about May 10, 2018 and posted on our website, http://ir.capfed.com . For best viewing results, please view this release in Portable Document Format (PDF) on our website.\nHighlights for the quarter include:\nnet income of $23.3 million; basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.17; net interest margin of 1.86% (2.24% excluding the effects of the leverage strategy); and dividends paid of $11.4 million, or $0.085 per share.\nCapitol Federal, the parent company of Capitol Federal ® Savings Bank (\"Capitol Federal Savings\" or the \"Bank\"), and CCB, the parent company of Capital City Bank, a state chartered bank headquartered in Topeka, KS, announced the signing of a definitive agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which CCB will merge with and into Capitol Federal. Immediately upon closing the merger, Capital City Bank will merge with and into Capitol Federal Savings. As of March 31, 2018 and excluding purchase accounting, the combined company would have had pro-forma total assets of $9.5 billion, gross loans of $7.5 billion, deposits of $5.7 billion and an equity position of approximately $1.4 billion.\nWith the acquisition of Capital City Bank, Capitol Federal Savings will enter the commercial banking business, through the origination of commercial lending products and offering of commercial deposit services, for the first time in its 125 year history. While Capitol Federal Savings has built a small, but meaningful, portfolio of mostly commercial real estate loan participations through its network of correspondent banks over the course of the last five years (which portfolio totaled approximately $462 million in gross loans as of March 31, 2018), this merger with Capital City will enable the Company to offer a full array of commercial lending and deposit products and services. With the talented and experienced commercial banking teams from Capital City Bank joining Capitol Federal Savings, the Company will be able to introduce these lines of banking into its branches in overlapping communities upon closing of the merger, while working to expand to the other communities served by Capitol Federal.\nStrategically and financially attractive acquisition of a $400 million commercial bank Enhances deposit franchise and provides entry into commercial banking business lines Delivers scalable banking platform, while remaining under $10 billion in assets\nJohn B. Dicus, Chairman and President of Capitol Federal, stated: \"We are pleased to be merging with Capital City Bank to introduce a full commercial banking experience to our customer base and communities. Capital City Bank has a long history of building a conservative, customer focused community bank, with an overlapping geographic focus in markets highly familiar to us - Topeka, Lawrence and the Overland Park market of Kansas City. Through the leadership of the Sabatini family, Capital City Bank has built a well-regarded company over the course of many decades, driven by the people and platforms we need to enter the commercial banking business in the right way and in a meaningful way. Through the many years of knowing the team at Capital City Bank, it is obvious to us that we hold a shared cultural approach to banking, focused on risk management and customer service. In addition, we are able to complete this merger and remain under $10 billion in assets, allowing us to continue our current dividend policy of paying 100% of earnings, while providing a positive upside.\"\nComparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company recognized net income of $23.3 million, or $0.17 per share, compared to net income of $31.8 million, or $0.24 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in net income was due primarily to higher income tax expense in the current quarter compared to the prior quarter. The effective income tax rate in the current quarter was 26.5% compared to 2.6% in the prior quarter. In the prior quarter, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") was enacted which reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), the Company revalued its deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 22, 2017 to account for the lower corporate income tax rate. The revaluation of the Company's deferred income tax assets and liabilities reduced income tax expense by $7.5 million in the prior quarter. The impact of the enactment of the Tax Act was an increase in basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.08 in the prior quarter. Management estimates the effective tax rate for the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 to be approximately the same as the current quarter effective income tax rate of 26.5%, resulting in an effective income tax rate of 20% to 21% for fiscal year 2018. Management estimates the effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2019 will be approximately 22%.\nNet interest income increased $515 thousand, or 1.0%, from the prior quarter to $49.9 million for the current quarter. The net interest margin increased three basis points from 1.83% for the prior quarter to 1.86% for the current quarter. Excluding the effects of the leverage strategy, the net interest margin would have increased four basis points from 2.20% for the prior quarter to 2.24% for the current quarter. The increase in net interest margin was due mainly to a decrease in the cost of borrowings not related to the leverage strategy, along with a reduction in interest expense resulting from fewer days in the current quarter.\nInterest and Dividend Income\nThe weighted average yield on total interest-earning assets for the current quarter increased eight basis points from the prior quarter, to 3.06%, while the average balance of interest-earning assets decreased $71.5 million between the two periods. Absent the impact of the leverage strategy, the weighted average yield on total interest-earning assets would have increased four basis points from the prior quarter, to 3.35%, while the average balance of interest-earning assets would have decreased $69.5 million. The following table presents the components of interest and dividend income for the time periods presented, along with the change measured in dollars and percent.\nFor the Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\nChange Expressed in:\n2018\n2017\nDollars\nPercent\n(Dollars in thousands)\nINTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME:\nLoans receivable\n$\n64,194\n$\n64,189\n$\n5\n—%\nCash and cash equivalents\n7,895\n7,114\n781\n11.0\nMortgage-backed securities (\"MBS\")\n5,390\n5,252\n138\n2.6\nFederal Home Loan Bank Topeka (\"FHLB\") stock\n3,201\n3,095\n106\n3.4\nInvestment securities\n1,094\n994\n100\n10.1\nTotal interest and dividend income\n$\n81,774\n$\n80,644\n$\n1,130\n1.4\nThe table above includes interest income on cash and cash equivalents associated and not associated with the leverage strategy. Interest income on cash and cash equivalents not related to the leverage strategy decreased $165 thousand from the prior quarter due to a $79.9 million decrease in the average balance primarily resulting from cash being used to pay off certain maturing term borrowings during the prior quarter, partially offset by a 25 basis point increase in the weighted average yield. Interest income on cash associated with the leverage strategy increased $945 thousand from the prior quarter due to a 23 basis point increase in the weighted average yield. In both cases, the increase in the weighted average yield was related to balances held at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City (the \"FRB of Kansas City\").\nInterest Expense\nThe weighted average rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities for the current quarter increased six basis points from the prior quarter, to 1.35%, while the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities decreased $33.3 million between the two periods. Absent the impact of the leverage strategy, the weighted average rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities for the current quarter would have increased one basis point from the prior quarter, to 1.30%, while the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities would have decreased $31.3 million. The following table presents the components of interest expense for the time periods presented, along with the change measured in dollars and percent.\nFor the Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\nChange Expressed in:\n2018\n2017\nDollars\nPercent\n(Dollars in thousands)\nINTEREST EXPENSE:\nFHLB borrowings\n$\n18,772\n$\n17,917\n$\n855\n4.8%\nDeposits\n12,480\n11,961\n519\n4.3\nRepurchase agreements\n633\n1,392\n(759)\n(54.5)\nTotal interest expense\n$\n31,885\n$\n31,270\n$\n615\n2.0\nThe table above includes interest expense on FHLB borrowings associated and not associated with the leverage strategy. Interest expense on FHLB borrowings not related to the leverage strategy decreased $218 thousand from the prior quarter due to a three basis point decrease in the weighted average rate paid, to 2.05% for the current quarter. Interest expense on FHLB borrowings associated with the leverage strategy increased $1.1 million from the prior quarter due to a 24 basis point increase in the weighted average rate paid as a result of an increase in interest rates between periods.\nThe increase in interest expense on deposits was due primarily to a five basis point increase in the weighted average rate paid, to 0.96% for the current quarter. The increase in the weighted average rate paid was primarily due to increases in the money market deposit portfolio rate and retail certificate of deposit portfolio rate, which increased 12 basis points and five basis points, respectively.\nThe decrease in interest expense on repurchase agreements was due to the maturity of a $100.0 million repurchase agreement during the prior quarter.\nProvision for Credit Losses\nThe Bank did not record a provision for credit losses during the current quarter or the prior quarter. Based on management's assessment of the allowance for credit losses (\"ACL\") formula analysis model and several other factors, it was determined that no provision for credit losses was necessary. Net loan recoveries were $20 thousand during the current quarter compared to net charge-offs of $28 thousand in the prior quarter. At March 31, 2018, loans 30 to 89 days delinquent were 0.19% of total loans and loans 90 or more days delinquent or in foreclosure were 0.16% of total loans. At December 31, 2017, loans 30 to 89 days delinquent were 0.25% of total loans and loans 90 or more days delinquent or in foreclosure were 0.15% of total loans.\nNon-Interest Income\nThe following table presents the components of non-interest income for the time periods presented, along with the change measured in dollars and percent.\nFor the Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\nChange Expressed in:\n2018\n2017\nDollars\nPercent\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNON-INTEREST INCOME:\nRetail fees and charges\n$\n3,670\n$\n3,965\n$\n(295)\n(7.4)%\nIncome from bank-owned life insurance (\"BOLI\")\n276\n534\n(258)\n(48.3)\nOther non-interest income\n1,487\n859\n628\n73.1\nTotal non-interest income\n$\n5,433\n$\n5,358\n$\n75\n1.4\nThe decrease in retail fees and charges was due mainly to a decrease in debit card income resulting from a reduction in transaction volume due to the seasonality of such activity. The decrease in income from BOLI was due mainly to a one-time adjustment to the benchmark interest rate associated with one of the policies. The increase in other non-interest income was due primarily to an increase in insurance commissions resulting from the receipt of annual commissions from certain insurance providers during the current quarter and no such commissions received during the prior quarter, along with a gain on the sale of loans during the current quarter compared to a loss on the sale of loans during the prior quarter as management continues to test loan sale processes for liquidity purposes.\nNon-Interest Expense\nThe following table presents the components of non-interest expense for the time periods presented, along with the change measured in dollars and percent.\nFor the Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\nChange Expressed in:\n2018\n2017\nDollars\nPercent\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNON-INTEREST EXPENSE:\nSalaries and employee benefits\n$\n11,167\n$\n10,528\n$\n639\n6.1%\nInformation technology and related expense\n3,622\n3,331\n291\n8.7\nOccupancy, net\n2,839\n2,765\n74\n2.7\nDeposit and loan transaction costs\n1,313\n1,407\n(94)\n(6.7)\nRegulatory and outside services\n1,151\n1,140\n11\n1.0\nFederal insurance premium\n847\n852\n(5)\n(0.6)\nAdvertising and promotional\n1,337\n685\n652\n95.2\nOffice supplies and related expense\n442\n442\n—\n—\nOther non-interest expense\n880\n886\n(6)\n(0.7)\nTotal non-interest expense\n$\n23,598\n$\n22,036\n$\n1,562\n7.1\nThe increase in salaries and employee benefits expense was due primarily to the timing of expenses related to paid time-off usage and accruals, as well as to a new 2018 Tax Savings Bonus Plan. The 2018 Tax Savings Bonus plan is a one-time bonus award to qualifying non-officer employees. The anticipated expense associated with this plan will be recognized in fiscal year 2018 and is approximately $1.0 million, of which $333 thousand was recognized during the current quarter. It is expected that the Bank will recognize approximately $333 thousand of expense per quarter in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2018 related to this plan. The increase in advertising and promotional expense was due primarily to the timing of media campaigns and sponsorships.\nThe Company's efficiency ratio was 42.66% for the current quarter compared to 40.26% for the prior quarter. The change in the efficiency ratio was due primarily to higher non-interest expense in the current quarter compared to the prior quarter. The efficiency ratio is a measure of a financial institution's total non-interest expense as a percentage of the sum of net interest income (pre-provision for credit losses) and non-interest income. A lower value indicates that the financial institution is generating revenue with a proportionally lower level of expense.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense was $8.4 million for the current quarter, compared to $860 thousand for the prior quarter. The effective tax rate was 26.5% for the current quarter compared to 2.6% for the prior quarter. The lower effective income tax rate and income tax expense in the prior quarter were due primarily to revaluing the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017. Management estimates the effective tax rate for the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 to be approximately the same as the current quarter effective income tax rate of 26.5%.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Six Months Ended March 31, 2018 and 2017\nThe Company recognized net income of $55.2 million, or $0.41 per share, for the six month period ended March 31, 2018 compared to net income of $42.2 million, or $0.31 per share, for the six month period ended March 31, 2017. The increase in net income was due primarily to a decrease in income tax expense resulting from the Tax Act being signed into law in December 2017.\nThe net interest margin increased eight basis points, from 1.77% for the prior year six month period to 1.85% for the current year six month period. Excluding the effects of the leverage strategy, the net interest margin would have increased 11 basis points, from 2.11% for the prior year six month period to 2.22% for the current year six month period. The increase in the net interest margin was due mainly to an increase in interest-earning asset yields, as well as a shift in the mix of interest-earning assets from relatively lower yielding securities to higher yielding loans and a net decrease in the cost of liabilities not related to the leverage strategy.\nInterest and Dividend Income\nThe weighted average yield on total interest-earning assets increased 22 basis points, from 2.80% for the prior year six month period to 3.02% for the current year six month period, while the average balance of interest-earning assets decreased $163.7 million from the prior year six month period. Absent the impact of the leverage strategy, the weighted average yield on total interest-earning assets would have increased 10 basis points, from 3.23% for the prior year six month period to 3.33% for the current year six month period, while the average balance of interest-earning assets would have decreased $152.2 million. The following table presents the components of interest and dividend income for the time periods presented along with the change measured in dollars and percent.\nFor the Six Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nChange Expressed in:\n2018\n2017\nDollars\nPercent\n(Dollars in thousands)\nINTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME:\nLoans receivable\n$\n128,383\n$\n125,051\n$\n3,332\n2.7%\nCash and cash equivalents\n15,009\n7,101\n7,908\n111.4\nMBS\n10,642\n12,553\n(1,911)\n(15.2)\nFHLB stock\n6,296\n6,039\n257\n4.3\nInvestment securities\n2,088\n2,238\n(150)\n(6.7)\nTotal interest and dividend income\n$\n162,418\n$\n152,982\n$\n9,436\n6.2\nThe increase in interest income on loans receivable was due mainly to a $118.3 million increase in the average balance of the portfolio, as well as a four basis point increase in the weighted average yield on the portfolio to 3.57% for the current year six month period. The increase in the weighted average yield was due primarily to adjustable-rate loans repricing to higher market rates, along with the origination and purchase of new loans at higher market rates.\nThe table above includes interest income on cash and cash equivalents associated and not associated with the leverage strategy. Interest income on cash and cash equivalents not related to the leverage strategy increased $794 thousand from the prior year six month period due to a 72 basis point increase in the weighted average yield. Interest income on cash associated with the leverage strategy increased $7.1 million from the prior year six month period due to a 74 basis point increase in the weighted average yield. In both cases, the increase in the weighted average yield was related to balances held at the FRB of Kansas City.\nThe decrease in interest income on the MBS portfolio was due to a $227.4 million decrease in the average balance of the portfolio, partially offset by a 12 basis point increase in the weighted average yield on the portfolio to 2.28% for the current year six month period. Cash flows not reinvested were used primarily to fund loan growth and pay off certain maturing term borrowings. The increase in the weighted average yield was due primarily to adjustable-rate MBS repricing to higher market rates, as well as a decrease in the impact of net premium amortization. Net premium amortization of $1.6 million during the current year six month period decreased the weighted average yield on the portfolio by 35 basis points. During the prior year six month period, $2.3 million of net premiums were amortized which decreased the weighted average yield on the portfolio by 40 basis points. As of March 31, 2018, the remaining net balance of premiums on our portfolio of MBS was $7.4 million.\nInterest Expense\nThe weighted average rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities increased 15 basis points, from 1.17% for the prior year six month period to 1.32% for the current year six month period, while the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities decreased $134.6 million from the prior year six month period. Absent the impact of the leverage strategy, the weighted average rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities would have decreased one basis point, from 1.30% for the prior year six month period to 1.29% for the current year six month period, and the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities would have decreased $123.0 million. The following table presents the components of interest expense for the time periods presented, along with the change measured in dollars and percent.\nFor the Six Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nChange Expressed in:\n2018\n2017\nDollars\nPercent\n(Dollars in thousands)\nINTEREST EXPENSE:\nFHLB borrowings\n$\n36,689\n$\n32,888\n$\n3,801\n11.6%\nDeposits\n24,441\n20,760\n3,681\n17.7\nRepurchase agreements\n2,025\n2,974\n(949)\n(31.9)\nTotal interest expense\n$\n63,155\n$\n56,622\n$\n6,533\n11.5\nThe table above includes interest expense on FHLB borrowings associated and not associated with the leverage strategy. Interest expense on FHLB borrowings not related to the leverage strategy decreased $3.9 million from the prior year six month period due to a 22 basis point decrease in the weighted average rate paid on the portfolio, to 2.06% for the current year six month period, and a $140.9 million decrease in the average balance of the portfolio. The decrease in the weighted average rate paid was due to certain advances maturing between periods being replaced at lower effective interest rates. The decrease in the average balance was a result of using cash flows from the securities portfolio and funds generated from deposit growth to pay off certain advances that matured between periods. Interest expense on FHLB borrowings associated with the leverage strategy increased $7.7 million from the prior year six month period due to a 77 basis point increase in the weighted average rate paid as a result of an increase in interest rates between periods.\nThe increase in interest expense on deposits was due primarily to a 13 basis point increase in the weighted average rate, to 0.93% for the current year six month period. The increase in the weighted average rate was primarily related to the certificate of deposit portfolio, which increased 19 basis points to 1.53% for the current year six month period. The weighted average rate paid on wholesale certificates increased 64 basis points, to 1.38% for the current year six month period.\nNon-Interest Income\nThe following table presents the components of non-interest income for the time periods presented, along with the change measured in dollars and percent.\nFor the Six Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nChange Expressed in:\n2018\n2017\nDollars\nPercent\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNON-INTEREST INCOME:\nRetail fees and charges\n$\n7,635\n$\n7,291\n$\n344\n4.7%\nIncome from BOLI\n810\n1,096\n(286)\n(26.1)\nOther non-interest income\n2,346\n2,454\n(108)\n(4.4)\nTotal non-interest income\n$\n10,791\n$\n10,841\n$\n(50)\n(0.5)\nThe increase in retail fees and charges was due mainly to increases in debit card income due to higher transaction volume in the current year and a reduction in waived fees as customers and vendors have become more accustomed to the chip card technology. The decrease in income from BOLI was due mainly to a one-time adjustment to the benchmark interest rate associated with one of the policies.\nNon-Interest Expense\nThe following table presents the components of non-interest expense for the time periods presented, along with the change measured in dollars and percent.\nFor the Six Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nChange Expressed in:\n2018\n2017\nDollars\nPercent\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNON-INTEREST EXPENSE:\nSalaries and employee benefits\n$\n21,695\n$\n21,178\n$\n517\n2.4%\nInformation technology and related expense\n6,953\n5,602\n1,351\n24.1\nOccupancy, net\n5,604\n5,439\n165\n3.0\nDeposit and loan transaction costs\n2,720\n2,614\n106\n4.1\nRegulatory and outside services\n2,291\n2,611\n(320)\n(12.3)\nFederal insurance premium\n1,699\n1,772\n(73)\n(4.1)\nAdvertising and promotional\n2,022\n1,953\n69\n3.5\nOffice supplies and related expense\n884\n978\n(94)\n(9.6)\nOther non-interest expense\n1,766\n1,387\n379\n27.3\nTotal non-interest expense\n$\n45,634\n$\n43,534\n$\n2,100\n4.8\nThe increase in salaries and employee benefits expense was due primarily to the 2018 Tax Savings Bonus Plan as previously discussed. The increase in information technology and related expense and the decrease in regulatory and outside services were due mainly to a change in the presentation of certain information technology professional and consulting expenses beginning in fiscal year 2018. Information technology professional and consulting expenses are now being reported in information technology and related expenses rather than regulatory and outside services. Additionally, these expenses increased compared to the prior year due primarily to ongoing enhancements to the Bank's online banking services, along with increases in information technology expenses related to software licensing and depreciation. The increase in other non-interest expense was due mainly to an increase in other real estate owned (\"OREO\") operations expense.\nThe Company's efficiency ratio was 41.47% for the current year six month period compared to 40.61% for the prior year six month period. The change in the efficiency ratio was due primarily to higher non-interest expense in the current year six month period compared to the prior year six month period.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense was $9.3 million for the current year six month period compared to $21.5 million for the prior year six month period. The effective tax rate was 14.4% for the current year six month period compared to 33.8% for the prior year six month period. The decrease in effective tax rate was due mainly to the Tax Act being signed into law in December 2017.\nFinancial Condition as of March 31, 2018\nTotal assets were $9.12 billion at March 31, 2018 compared to $9.19 billion at September 30, 2017. The $76.5 million decrease was due primarily to a $211.1 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by an increase in FHLB stock. At March 31, 2018, the Bank was not required by the FHLB to redeem the FHLB stock associated with the leverage strategy. At September 30, 2017, this stock was redeemed.\nThe loans receivable portfolio, net, totaled $7.20 billion at March 31, 2018 and at September 30, 2017. During the current year six month period, the Bank originated and refinanced $261.0 million of loans with a weighted average rate of 3.89% and purchased $210.9 million of one- to four-family loans from correspondent lenders with a weighted average rate of 3.60%. The Bank also entered into participations of $107.6 million of commercial real estate loans with a weighted average rate of 4.15%, of which $97.8 million had not yet been funded as of March 31, 2018. During the current year six month period, the Bank funded $52.0 million of new and existing commercial real estate loans. There are no agricultural loans in the Bank's loan portfolio.\nThe Bank is continuing to manage the size of its loan portfolio as it manages its liquidity levels to a target level of 15%. The size of the loan portfolio has been managed by controlling correspondent loan volume primarily through the rates offered to correspondent lenders. Given the balance of total assets, it is unlikely that loan growth will substantially increase in the current environment. Generally, over the past few years, cash flows from the securities portfolio have been used primarily to purchase loans and in part to pay down FHLB advances. By moving cash from lower yielding assets to higher yielding assets and repaying higher cost liabilities, we have been able to maintain our net interest margin. In addition to the repayment of securities, the Bank has emphasized growth in the deposit portfolio in part to pay down FHLB advances. The ratio of securities and cash to total assets was 15.5% at March 31, 2018. In the long run, management considers a 10% ratio of stockholders' equity to total assets at the Bank an appropriate level of capital. At March 31, 2018, this ratio was 13.3%.\nThe Bank has continued to utilize a leverage strategy to increase earnings in fiscal year 2018. The leverage strategy during the current quarter involved borrowing up to $2.10 billion either on the Bank's FHLB line of credit or by entering into short-term FHLB advances, depending on the rates offered by FHLB. The borrowings were repaid prior to quarter end for regulatory purposes. The proceeds from the borrowings, net of the required FHLB stock holdings, which yielded 6.7% during the current quarter and 6.6% during the current year six month period, were deposited at the FRB of Kansas City. Net income attributable to the leverage strategy is largely derived from the dividends received on FHLB stock holdings, plus the net interest rate spread between the yield on the cash at the FRB of Kansas City and the rate paid on the related FHLB borrowings, less applicable federal insurance premiums and estimated taxes. Net income attributable to the leverage strategy was $713 thousand during the current quarter, compared to $767 thousand during the prior quarter. The decrease between quarters was due to a decrease in the net interest rate spread between the yield on the cash at the FRB of Kansas City and the rate paid on the related FHLB borrowings, partially offset by an increase in the yield on the related FHLB stock. Net income attributable to the leverage strategy was $1.5 million for both the current year six month period and the prior year six month period. Management continues to monitor the net interest rate spread and overall profitability of the strategy. The net interest rate spread from the leverage strategy is currently negative and, based on current interest rates, it is anticipated that the net interest rate spread will continue to be negative for some time. If the negative net interest rate spread worsens, management will likely suspend the strategy until it is in a position that generates income.\nTotal liabilities were $7.75 billion at March 31, 2018 compared to $7.82 billion at September 30, 2017. The $72.9 million decrease was due mainly to a decrease in repurchase agreements, partially offset by an increase in deposits. Repurchase agreements decreased due to the maturity of a $100.0 million repurchase agreement during the current year six month period. Deposits increased $44.3 million, to $5.35 billion at March 31, 2018, due mainly to an increase in checking accounts.\nStockholders' equity was $1.36 billion at March 31, 2018 compared to $1.37 billion at September 30, 2017. The $3.6 million decrease was due primarily to the payment of $61.8 million in cash dividends, partially offset by net income of $55.2 million. The cash dividends paid during the current year six month period totaled $0.46 per share and consisted of a $0.29 per share cash true-up dividend related to fiscal year 2017 earnings per the Company's dividend policy, and two regular quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.17 per share. On April 18, 2018, the Company announced a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.085 per share, or approximately $11.4 million, payable on May 18, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 4, 2018.\nAt March 31, 2018, Capitol Federal Financial, Inc., at the holding company level, had $110.8 million on deposit at the Bank. For fiscal year 2018, it is the intent of the Board of Directors and management to continue the payout of 100% of the Company's earnings to its stockholders. Dividend payments depend upon a number of factors including the Company's financial condition and results of operations, regulatory capital requirements, regulatory limitations on the Bank's ability to make capital distributions to the Company, and the amount of cash at the holding company.\nIn October 2015, the Company announced a stock repurchase plan for up to $70.0 million of common stock. The repurchase plan does not have an expiration date. The Company has not repurchased any shares under the repurchase plan through the date of this release.\nThe following table presents the balance of stockholders' equity and related information as of the dates presented.\nMarch 31,\nSeptember 30,\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n2017\n(Dollars in thousands)\nStockholders' equity\n$\n1,364,740\n$\n1,368,313\n$\n1,382,289\nEquity to total assets at end of period\n15.0%\n14.9%\n14.9%\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of total to net shares outstanding as of March 31, 2018.\nTotal shares outstanding\n138,250,235\nLess unallocated Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\"ESOP\") shares and unvested restricted stock\n(3,773,556)\nNet shares outstanding\n134,476,679\nConsistent with our goal to operate a sound and profitable financial organization, we actively seek to maintain a well-capitalized status for the Bank in accordance with regulatory standards.

Substantially all of the $102.6 million of commercial real estate construction loans had not yet been funded as of March 31, 2018. The Bank intends to continue to grow its commercial real estate loan portfolio through participations with correspondent lenders and other select lead banks.\nThe following table presents the Bank's commercial real estate loans and loan commitments by industry classification, as defined by the North American Industry Classification System, as of March 31, 2018. Based on the terms of the construction loans as of March 31, 2018, of the $162.4 million of undisbursed amounts in the table, $26.4 million is projected to be disbursed by June 30, 2018, and an additional $102.0 million is projected to be disbursed by March 31, 2019. It is possible that not all of the funds will be disbursed due to the nature of the funding of construction projects. Included in the table are fixed-rate loans totaling $315.7 million at a weighted average rate of 4.09% and adjustable-rate loans totaling $152.6 million at a weighted average rate of 4.61%. The weighted average rate of fixed-rate loans is lower than that of adjustable-rate loans due to the majority of the fixed-rate loans in the portfolio at March 31, 2018 having shorter terms to maturity. The credit risk for several of the Bank's borrowing relationships is mitigated due to the amount of equity injected into the projects, strong debt service coverage ratios, and liquidity, personal cash flow and net worth of the guarantors. Several of these borrowing relationships have a preference for fixed-rate loans and the market interest rates are typically lower for these types of borrowers.\nUnpaid\nUndisbursed\nGross Loan\nOutstanding\n% of\nPrincipal\nAmount\nAmount\nCommitments\nTotal\nTotal\n(Dollars in thousands)\nAccommodation and food services\n$\n141,707\n$\n39,012\n$\n180,719\n$\n—\n$\n180,719\n38.6%\nHealth care and social assistance\n60,936\n72,261\n133,197\n—\n133,197\n28.4\nReal estate rental and leasing\n29,387\n29,009\n58,396\n490\n58,886\n12.6\nArts, entertainment, and recreation\n33,116\n—\n33,116\n—\n33,116\n7.1\nMulti-family\n10,012\n20,950\n30,962\n—\n30,962\n6.6\nRetail trade\n17,851\n1,159\n19,010\n5,900\n24,910\n5.3\nManufacturing\n6,377\n—\n6,377\n—\n6,377\n1.4\nOther\n116\n—\n116\n—\n116\n—\n$\n299,502\n$\n162,391\n$\n461,893\n$\n6,390\n$\n468,283\n100.0%\nWeighted average rate\n4.14%\n4.45%\n4.25%\n5.05%\n4.26%\nThe following table summarizes the Bank's commercial real estate loans and loan commitments by state as of March 31, 2018.\nUnpaid\nUndisbursed\nGross Loan\nOutstanding\n% of\nPrincipal\nAmount\nAmount\nCommitments\nTotal\nTotal\n(Dollars in thousands)\nTexas\n$\n117,200\n$\n55,865\n$\n173,065\n$\n5,900\n$\n178,965\n38.2%\nMissouri\n85,037\n84,076\n169,113\n490\n169,603\n36.2\nKansas\n73,735\n—\n73,735\n—\n73,735\n15.7\nNebraska\n—\n20,950\n20,950\n—\n20,950\n4.5\nColorado\n7,869\n—\n7,869\n—\n7,869\n1.7\nArkansas\n7,861\n—\n7,861\n—\n7,861\n1.7\nCalifornia\n6,377\n—\n6,377\n—\n6,377\n1.4\nMontana\n1,423\n1,500\n2,923\n—\n2,923\n0.6\n$\n299,502\n$\n162,391\n$\n461,893\n$\n6,390\n$\n468,283\n100.0%\nThe following table presents the Bank's commercial real estate loan portfolio and outstanding loan commitments, categorized by gross loan amount (unpaid principal plus undisbursed amounts) or outstanding loan commitment amount, as of March 31, 2018.\nCount\nAmount\n(Dollars in thousands)\nGreater than $30 million\n4\n$\n156,352\n>$15 to $30 million\n8\n187,584\n>$10 to $15 million\n3\n37,263\n>$5 to $10 million\n3\n20,138\n$1 to $5 million\n21\n59,475\nLess than $1 million\n18\n7,471\n57\n$\n468,283\nAsset Quality\nThe following tables present loans 30 to 89 days delinquent, non-performing loans, and OREO as of the dates indicated.

The effective rate and WAM presented include the effect of the interest rate swaps.\nAverage Rates and Lives\nAt March 31, 2018, the Bank's gap between the amount of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities projected to reprice within one year was $65.6 million, or 0.72% of total assets, compared to $185.2 million, or 2.06% of total assets, at December 31, 2017. The decrease in the one-year gap amount was due primarily to a decrease in the amount of mortgage-related assets projected to reprice due to higher interest rates. As interest rates rise, borrowers have less economic incentive to refinance their mortgages and agency debt issuers have less economic incentive or opportunity to exercise their call options in order to issue new debt at lower interest rates. This increase in interest rates resulted in lower projected cash flows on these assets over the next year compared to December 31, 2017. The decrease in the projected cash flows on mortgage-related assets was partially offset by an increase in the amount of cash held at March 31, 2018.\nThe majority of interest-earning assets anticipated to reprice in the coming year are repayments and prepayments on mortgage loans and MBS, both of which include the option to prepay without a fee being paid by the contract holder. The amount of interest-bearing liabilities expected to reprice in a given period is not typically impacted significantly by changes in interest rates because the Bank's borrowings and certificate of deposit portfolios have contractual maturities and generally cannot be terminated early without a prepayment penalty. If interest rates were to increase 200 basis points, as of March 31, 2018, the Bank's one-year gap is projected to be $(327.0) million, or (3.59)% of total assets. This compares to a one-year gap of $(305.9) million, or (3.40)% of total assets, if interest rates were to have increased 200 basis points as of December 31, 2017.\nDuring the current quarter, loan repayments totaled $246.9 million and cash flows from the securities portfolio totaled $115.9 million. The asset cash flows of $362.8 million were reinvested into new assets at current market interest rates. Total cash flows from fixed-rate liabilities that matured and repriced into current market interest rates during the current quarter were $337.2 million. These offsetting cash flows allow the Bank to manage its interest rate risk and gap position more precisely than if the Bank did not have offsetting cash flows due to its mix of assets or maturity structure of liabilities.\nOther strategies include managing the Bank's wholesale assets and liabilities. The Bank primarily uses long-term fixed-rate borrowings with no embedded options to lengthen the average life of the Bank's liabilities. The fixed-rate characteristics of these borrowings lock-in the cost until maturity and thus decrease the amount of liabilities repricing as interest rates move higher compared to funding with lower-cost short-term borrowings. These borrowings are laddered in order to prevent large amounts of liabilities repricing in any one period. The WAL of the Bank's term borrowings as of March 31, 2018 was 2.0 years. However, including the impact of interest rate swaps related to $200.0 million of adjustable-rate FHLB advances, the WAL of the Bank's term borrowings as of March 31, 2018 was 2.4 years. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the adjustable-rate borrowings into long-term, fixed-rate liabilities.\nThe Bank uses the securities portfolio to shorten the average life of the Bank's assets. Purchases in the securities portfolio over the past few years have primarily been focused on callable agency debentures with maturities no longer than five years, shorter duration MBS, and adjustable-rate MBS. These securities have a shorter average life and provide a steady source of cash flow that can be reinvested as interest rates rise or used to purchase higher-yielding assets. The WAL of the Bank's securities portfolio as of March 31, 2018 was 2.7 years.\nIn addition to the wholesale strategies, the Bank has sought to increase core deposits and long-term certificates of deposit. Core deposits are expected to reduce the risk of higher interest rates because their interest rates are not expected to increase significantly as market interest rates rise. Specifically, checking accounts and savings accounts have had minimal interest rate fluctuations throughout historical interest rate cycles, though no assurance can be given that this will be the case in future interest rate cycles. The balances and rates of these accounts have historically tended to remain very stable over time, giving them the characteristic of long-term liabilities. The Bank uses historical data pertaining to these accounts to estimate their future balances. At March 31, 2018 the WAL of the Bank's non-maturity deposits was 12.8 years.\nOver the last few years, the Bank has priced long-term certificates of deposit more aggressively than short-term certificates of deposit with the goal of giving customers incentive to move funds into longer-term certificates of deposit when interest rates were lower. The balance of our retail certificates of deposit with terms of 36 months or longer increased $322.6 million, or 24%, since March 31, 2015. Long-term certificates of deposit reduce the amount of liabilities repricing as interest rates rise in a given time period.\nBecause of the on-balance sheet strategies implemented over the past several years, management believes the Bank is well-positioned to move into a market rate environment where interest rates are higher.\nThe following table presents the weighted average yields/rates and WALs (in years), after applying prepayment, call assumptions, and decay rates for our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities as of March 31, 2018. Yields presented for interest-earning assets include the amortization of fees, costs, premiums and discounts, which are considered adjustments to the yield. The interest rate presented for term borrowings is the effective rate, which includes the impact of interest rate swaps and amortization of deferred prepayment penalties resulting from FHLB advances previously prepaid. The WAL presented for term borrowings includes the effect of interest rate swaps. The maturity and repricing terms presented for one- to four-family loans represent the contractual terms of the loan.\nAmount\nYield/Rate\nWAL\n% of Category\n% of Total\n(Dollars in thousands)\nInvestment securities\n$\n293,113\n1.61%\n1.3\n23.0%\n3.3%\nMBS - fixed\n644,051\n2.23\n3.2\n50.5\n7.3\nMBS - adjustable\n338,354\n2.70\n3.0\n26.5\n3.9\nTotal securities\n1,275,518\n2.21\n2.7\n100.0%\n14.5\nLoans receivable:\nFixed-rate one- to four-family:\n<= 15 years\n1,164,767\n3.08\n4.1\n16.2%\n13.2\n> 15 years\n4,468,744\n3.83\n6.5\n62.2\n50.8\nAll other fixed-rate loans\n276,262\n4.20\n4.6\n3.8\n3.1\nTotal fixed-rate loans\n5,909,773\n3.70\n6.0\n82.2\n67.1\nAdjustable-rate one- to four-family:\n<= 36 months\n255,774\n1.82\n3.4\n3.6\n2.9\n> 36 months\n848,455\n3.12\n2.8\n11.8\n9.7\nAll other adjustable-rate loans\n173,740\n5.01\n3.9\n2.4\n2.0\nTotal adjustable-rate loans\n1,277,969\n3.12\n3.0\n17.8\n14.6\nTotal loans receivable\n7,187,742\n3.60\n5.5\n100.0%\n81.7\nFHLB stock\n195,626\n6.74\n1.0\n2.2\nCash and cash equivalents\n140,580\n1.75\n—\n1.6\nTotal interest-earning assets\n$\n8,799,466\n3.44\n4.9\n100.0%\nNon-maturity deposits\n$\n2,508,553\n0.25\n12.8\n46.8%\n32.9%\nRetail certificates of deposit\n2,456,532\n1.64\n1.9\n45.9\n32.2\nPublic units\n389,108\n1.56\n0.9\n7.3\n5.1\nTotal deposits\n5,354,193\n0.98\n6.9\n100.0%\n70.2\nTerm borrowings\n2,175,000\n2.09\n2.4\n95.6%\n28.5\nFHLB line of credit\n100,000\n1.75\n—\n4.4\n1.3\nTotal borrowings\n2,275,000\n2.08\n2.3\n100.0%\n29.8\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities\n$\n7,629,193\n1.31\n5.5\n100.0%\nAverage Balance Sheets\nThe following table presents the average balances of our assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity, and the related annualized weighted average yields and rates on our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated and the weighted average yield/rate on our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities at March 31, 2018, as well as selected performance ratios and other information as of the dates and for the periods shown.

Included in this line, for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, are FHLB borrowings related to the leverage strategy with an average outstanding amount of $2.01 billion for each of the two periods, interest paid of $7.8 million and $6.7 million, respectively, at a rate of 1.55% and 1.31%, respectively, and FHLB borrowings not related to the leverage strategy with an average outstanding amount of $2.17 billion and $2.14 billion, respectively, interest paid of $11.0 million and $11.2 million, respectively, at a rate of 2.05% and 2.08%, respectively. The FHLB advance amounts and rates included in this line include the effect of interest rate swaps and are net of deferred prepayment penalties.\n(6)\nNet interest income represents the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends on the balance of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and the interest rates earned or paid on them.\n(7)\nNet interest rate spread represents the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities.\n(8)\nThe table below provides a reconciliation between certain performance ratios presented in accordance with GAAP and the performance ratios excluding the effects of the leverage strategy, which are not presented in accordance with GAAP. Management believes it is important for comparability purposes to provide the performance ratios without the leverage strategy because of the unique nature of the leverage strategy. The leverage strategy reduces some of our performance ratios due to the amount of earnings associated with the transaction in comparison to the size of the transaction, while increasing our net income.\nFor the Six Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\nActual\nLeverage\nAdjusted\nActual\nLeverage\nAdjusted\n(GAAP)\nStrategy\n(Non-GAAP)\n(GAAP)\nStrategy\n(Non-GAAP)\nReturn on average assets (annualized)\n1.00%\n(0.19)%\n1.19%\n0.75%\n(0.14)%\n0.89%\nReturn on average equity (annualized)\n8.10\n0.22\n7.88\n6.09\n0.22\n5.87\nNet interest margin\n1.85\n(0.37)\n2.22\n1.77\n(0.34)\n2.11\nNet interest rate spread\n1.70\n(0.34)\n2.04\n1.63\n(0.30)\n1.93\nFor the Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nActual\nLeverage\nAdjusted\nActual\nLeverage\nAdjusted\n(GAAP)\nStrategy\n(Non-GAAP)\n(GAAP)\nStrategy\n(Non-GAAP)\nReturn on average assets (annualized)\n0.85%\n(0.15)%\n1.00%\n1.15%\n(0.22)%\n1.37%\nReturn on average equity (annualized)\n6.86\n0.21\n6.65\n9.33\n0.22\n9.11\nNet interest margin\n1.86\n(0.38)\n2.24\n1.83\n(0.37)\n2.20\nNet interest rate spread\n1.71\n(0.34)\n2.05\n1.69\n(0.33)\n2.02\n(9)\nNet interest margin represents annualized net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets.\n(10)\nThe operating expense ratio represents annualized non-interest expense as a percentage of average assets.\n(11)\nThe efficiency ratio represents non-interest expense as a percentage of the sum of net interest income (pre-provision for credit losses) and non-interest income.\n(12)\nThe pre-tax yield on the leverage strategy represents annualized pre-tax income resulting from the transaction as a percentage of the average interest-earning assets associated with the transaction.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/capitol-federal-financial-inc-announces-the-acquisition-of-capital-city-bancshares-and-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2018-results-300638665.html\nSOURCE Capitol Federal Financial, Inc.",
