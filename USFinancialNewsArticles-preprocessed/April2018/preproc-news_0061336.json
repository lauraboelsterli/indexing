    "text": "April 30, 2018 / 12:25 AM / Updated 7 hours ago Pemex security worker killed in attack in northern Mexico Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nMEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A security official with Mexico’s state oil company, Pemex, was killed in an attack in the border state of Tamaulipas, the company’s chief executive said on Sunday.\nJaime Juarez, 53, was in a vehicle doing surveillance work in the city of Matamoros on Friday when it was hit with 60 bullets. His colleague survived the attack.\nJuarez was just a few months from completing 20 years with Pemex, the company said in a statement, and had most recently worked combating the fuel theft that costs Pemex more than $1 billion a year.\nDrug cartels seeking to diversify income streams have preyed on Pemex, making fuel theft one of Mexico’s most pressing security issues.\nThe head of security at one of Mexico’s six state-run oil refineries was shot to death in January.
