    "text": "Jake Arrieta pitched seven strong innings, Aaron Altherr hit a three-run home run, and the Philadelphia Phillies defeated the visiting Arizona Diamondbacks 5-3 Wednesday at Citizens Bank Park.\nArrieta (3-0) gave up four hits and three runs (one earned) while throwing 107 pitches, 63 for strikes.\nCesar Hernandez was 3-for-4 with two runs for Philadelphia, and Carlos Santana went 2-for-4 with a run and an RBI.\nArizona starter Zack Greinke (2-2) was uncharacteristically ineffective in allowing nine hits and five runs in six innings. He threw first pitch strikes to only 14 of 26 batters faced, but he struck out nine while walking just one.\nKetel Marte had two of the Diamondbacks’ five hits.\nPhillies relievers Adam Morgan and Luis Garcia combined for a scoreless eighth inning. Hector Neris threw a shaky ninth inning but still earned his fifth save.\nOdubel Herrera’s sacrifice fly in the third scored Hernandez and gave the Phillies a 2-1 lead.\nHowever, three costly errors and sloppy play all around hurt the Phillies. Chris Owings received a bases-loaded walk from Arrieta to tie the game at 2 in the fourth.\nThe Diamondbacks then went ahead 3-2 in the sixth when Daniel Descalso hit a sacrifice fly to score Paul Goldschmidt.\nAltherr struck for a long three-run home run to center off Greinke in the sixth to put Philadelphia up 5-3. It was Altherr’s seventh hit in his past 18 at-bats after a sluggish start this season. Altherr also compiled at least one hit for the fourth straight game.\nA.J. Pollock lined out hard to deep center off Garcia with a runner on first and two outs in the eighth with the Diamondbacks still trailing 5-3.\nNeris struck out two, allowed two walks and a wild pitch but wriggled out of trouble in the ninth.\nThe teams play the rubber match of their three-game series Thursday afternoon.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
