The deadline for holders of Class A shares to submit their proxy is 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on May 22, 2018.\nPursuant to the Proposed Transactions, the Partnership's Class A shareholders and First Solar, Inc.

No consideration will be received by the Sponsors for the incentive distribution rights and the GP Transfer. Assuming a Closing Date of May 24, 2018, each holder of Class A shares and OpCo Units will receive $12.3833 per Class A share or OpCo Unit, which represents $12.6635 per Class A share or OpCo Unit less the first quarter distribution to be paid on April 13, 2018 of $0.2802 per Class A share or OpCo Unit.\nHolders of Class A shares who have questions about the proxy statement or voting their Class A shares should contact Innisfree M&A Incorporated, the Partnership's proxy solicitor, by calling toll-free at (877) 750-8338.\nSubject to satisfaction of the remaining closing conditions, including approval by the affirmative vote of (i) a majority of the outstanding Class A shares (excluding Class A shares owned by the General Partner or its affiliates), voting as a class, (ii) a majority of the outstanding Class B shares representing limited partner interests in the Partnership, voting as a class, (iii) a majority of the outstanding OpCo common units (excluding OpCo common units whose voting power is, with respect to the subject vote, controlled by the General Partner or its affiliates, other than the Partnership, through ownership or otherwise), voting as a class, and (iv) a majority of the outstanding OpCo subordinated units, voting as a class, the parties currently expect to close the Proposed Transactions in the second fiscal quarter of 2018. The Sponsors, the indirect owner of, in the aggregate, 100.0% of the outstanding Class B shares, approximately 35.6% of the outstanding OpCo common units and 100.0% of the outstanding OpCo subordinated units have agreed to vote in favor of the Proposed Transactions pursuant to a support agreement entered into among the Sponsors and Capital Dynamics.\nAbout 8point3\n8point3 Energy Partners LP (NASDAQ:CAFD) is a limited partnership formed by First Solar, Inc. and SunPower Corporation to own, operate and acquire solar energy generation projects.

All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements expressing management's expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions. You can identify our forward-looking statements by words such as \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"forecast\", \"goals\", \"objectives\", \"outlook\", \"intend\", \"plan\", \"predict\", \"project\", \"risks\", \"schedule\", \"seek\", \"target\", \"could\", \"may\", \"will\", \"should\" or \"would\" or other similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. In accordance with \"safe harbor\" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, these statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors, though not necessarily all such factors, which could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in forward-looking statements. In particular, expressed or implied statements concerning the sponsors' ownership interest in the Partnership, expectations of plans, strategies, objectives and growth and anticipated financial and operational performance of the Partnership and its subsidiaries, including guidance regarding the Partnership's revenue, net income, adjusted EBITDA, cash available for distribution and distributions, other future actions, conditions or events such as the commercial operation dates of projects, future operating results or the ability to generate sales, income or cash flow or to make distributions are forward-looking statements.

All forward-looking statements contained in this press release are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this paragraph. Many of the factors that will determine these results are beyond our ability to control or predict.
