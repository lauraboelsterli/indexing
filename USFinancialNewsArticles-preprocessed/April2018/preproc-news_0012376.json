    "text": "April 8, 2018 / 1:12 PM / Updated 21 minutes ago Cycling: Belgian rider in 'life-threatening' condition after cardiac arrest Julien Pretot 1 Min Read \nROUBAIX (Reuters) - Belgian rider Michael Goolaerts is in a “life-threatening condition after suffering a cardiac arrest” during the Paris-Roubaix cycling classic, race organizers said in a statement on Sunday. \nTV footage showed Goolaerts, 23, receiving CPR treatment from medics by the side of the road after crashing. \nShortly after the 257-km race ended, Paris-Roubaix director Christian Prudhomme told Reuters that Goolaerts had to undergo a scan at the Lille hospital. \n“His situation is still very worrying,” Prudhomme, who is also the Tour de France director, added. \nHis team, Veranda’s Willems-Crelan, said in a statement that Goolaerts had been taken to hospital having been involved in a crash. \nThey later appealed for people to refrain from speculation as they wait for an update on his situation. \n“Our thoughts are with his family and friends now,” the team said.
