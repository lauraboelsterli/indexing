REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader/File Photo Speaking in an interview with Reuters in New Delhi, he also said there was growing confidence that oil producers would extend their cooperation pact beyond 2018.\nRussia will continue to play a key role in future market rebalancing pacts, Barkindo said.\n“There is growing confidence that the declaration of cooperation will be extended beyond 2018,” Barkindo told Reuters.\n“Russia will continue to play a leading role.”\nThe initial draft of a longer-term alliance between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC oil producers would be discussed at their June meeting, he said.\nReporting by Nidhi Verma and Alex Lawler; Editing by Dale Hudson\n ",
