    "text": "SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgaria’s only nuclear plant, Kozloduy, shut one of its two 1,000-megawatt reactors for planned annual maintenance early on Saturday, its state-run operator said.\nIt said the reactor, Unit 5, will be connected back to the national electricity grid at the end of May once it is refueled and equipment repaired and upgraded.\nThe other Soviet-made 1,000-megawatt unit at the plant on the Danube was working at full capacity, the operator said in a statement.\nReporting by Angel Krasimirov, Editing by William Maclean\n 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
