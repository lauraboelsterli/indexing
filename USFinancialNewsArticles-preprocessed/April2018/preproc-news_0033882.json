    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - A suspicious substance has been found at the constituency office of immigration minister Caroline Nokes, police said on Tuesday, a day after she said some Caribbean immigrants incorrectly identified as illegal immigrants may have been deported.\nFirefighters and paramedics are also on the scene and the area around the office in southern England has been evacuated, Hampshire Police said.\n“We have been called to Market Place, Romsey, following the discovery of a suspicious substance,” they added in a statement.\nPrime Minister Theresa May apologised on Tuesday to representatives from 12 Caribbean countries over recent harsh treatment by immigration bureaucrats of people who arrived in Britain as children after World War Two.\nIn recent weeks, police have investigated several other potentially suspicious packages sent to British lawmakers, all of which have proved to be harmless.\nReporting By Andrew MacAskill; editing by Stephen Addison\n ",
