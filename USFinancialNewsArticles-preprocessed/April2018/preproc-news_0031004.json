    "text": "Starbucks Apologizes After 2 Black Men Were Arrested While Waiting Inside Store Photo by Jaap Arriens—NurPhoto/Getty Images NurPhoto NurPhoto via Getty Images By Lisa Marie Segarra April 14, 2018 \nStarbucks apologized after a video of two black men being arrested while waiting in a Philadelphia Starbucks went viral. \nThe two men were waiting inside the Starbucks location for a friend when they were asked to leave, CBS reported . The police were then called, and the two men were arrested. In a video posted to Twitter , other customers complained that two men hadn’t done anything wrong. @Starbucks The police were called because these men hadn’t ordered anything. They were waiting for a friend to show up, who did as they were taken out in handcuffs for doing nothing. All the other white ppl are wondering why it’s never happened to us when we do the same thing. pic.twitter.com/0U4Pzs55Ci \n— Melissa DePino (@missydepino) April 12, 2018 \n“The police were called because these men hadn’t ordered anything.
