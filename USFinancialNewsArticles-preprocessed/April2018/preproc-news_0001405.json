    "text": "April 3, 2018 / 2:31 PM / Updated 7 minutes ago CANADA STOCKS-TSX slips as material, energy stocks weigh Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nApril 3 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index fell on Tuesday as weakness in oil prices led to declines in energy stocks and dip in gold prices dragged the materials sector lower. \n* Gold producers fell 1.7 percent, weighing on the larger materials sector as prices of yellow metal edged lower after previous session’s surge. \n* The energy sector, which holds nearly 18 percent of the index’s weight, fell more than 23 points as oil prices struggled to retain gains as higher Russian output and Saudi Arabia possibly cutting its selling prices acted as a drag. \n* Wall Street rebounded, led by gains in the battered technology stocks following Monday’s selloff. \n* At 10:25 a.m. ET (1425 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index fell 64.87 points, or 0.43 percent, to 15,148.58. \n* The TSX posted two new 52-week highs and six new lows. Across all Canadian issues there were five new 52-week highs and 17 new lows. \n* The largest percentage gainer on the TSX was Interfor Corp , which rose 3.5 percent, while the largest decliner was Prometic Life Sciences, down 6.8 percent. \n* Among the most active Canadian stocks by volume were Neovasc Inc, Aurora Cannabis, and Prometic Life Sciences. \n* Volume on the TSX index was 26.74 million, while the total volume on Tuesday was 47.55 million shares.
