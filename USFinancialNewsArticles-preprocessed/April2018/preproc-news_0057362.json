Cash from operations was $171 million, and distributable cash flow was $194 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $247 million in the first quarter, compared with $254 million in the prior quarter.\n“Our first-quarter operating results reflect a $1 billion run-rate adjusted EBITDA, nearing our $1.1 billion year-end target and 30 percent five-year distribution CAGR,” said Greg Garland, chairman and CEO of Phillips 66 Partners. “We recently announced the Gray Oak Pipeline project, our largest organic growth project to date, which expands our footprint in the high-growth Permian Basin. We will continue to fund our organic projects in 2018 with cash on hand, debt capacity and selective use of our ATM program.”\nOn April 18, 2018, the general partner’s board of directors declared a first-quarter 2018 cash distribution of $0.714 per common unit, a 5.3 percent increase over the previous quarter distribution of $0.678 per common unit. The Partnership has increased its distribution per common unit every quarter since its initial public offering in July 2013.\nFinancial Results\nPhillips 66 Partners’ earnings for the first quarter of 2018 were $172 million, compared with $162 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The improvement reflects higher equity earnings, primarily driven by a one-time benefit from U.S. tax reform related to Explorer Pipeline, as well as improved joint venture volumes. These items were partially offset by lower volumes at certain wholly owned pipelines and terminals, reflecting the impact of turnarounds at refineries operated by Phillips 66.\nLiquidity, Capital Expenditures and Investments\nAs of March 31, 2018, total debt outstanding was $2.9 billion. The Partnership had $167 million in cash and cash equivalents and $750 million available under its revolving credit facility.\nThe Partnership’s total capital spending for the quarter was $69 million, which included $12 million of maintenance capital. Expansion capital was $57 million, which included spending on construction of a new isomerization unit at the Phillips 66 Lake Charles Refinery, as well as investments in the Sand Hills and Bayou Bridge pipelines.\nStrategic Update\nPhillips 66 Partners recently announced it has received sufficient binding commitments to proceed with construction of the Gray Oak Pipeline system. The Gray Oak Pipeline will provide crude oil transportation from West Texas to destinations in the Corpus Christi and Sweeny/Freeport markets, including the Phillips 66 Sweeny Refinery. A second binding open season is underway to determine the final scope and capacity of the pipeline system, which could be up to 700,000 barrels per day (BPD). Assuming the pipeline is fully subscribed, its capacity could ultimately be expanded to approximately 1 million BPD of long-haul takeaway. Phillips 66 Partners will initially own a 75 percent interest in the pipeline system. Other third parties have an option to acquire up to 32.75 percent interest in the joint venture. If all options are exercised, Phillips 66 Partners would own 42.25 percent. The pipeline is expected to be placed in service by the end of 2019.\nIn Corpus Christi, the Gray Oak Pipeline will connect to the new South Texas Gateway Terminal under development by Buckeye Partners, L.P. The marine terminal will have an initial storage capacity of 3.4 million barrels and is expected to begin operations by the end of 2019. Phillips 66 Partners will have a 25 percent ownership interest in the joint venture that owns the terminal.\nPhillips 66 Partners is developing a new pipeline that will connect clean product storage in Lake Charles, Louisiana, to its Clifton Ridge Marine Terminal, which will expand product export capability for the Phillips 66 Lake Charles Refinery. The approximately $25 million project will be backed by a long-term agreement with Phillips 66 that includes a minimum volume commitment. The pipeline is expected to be completed in mid-2019.\nConstruction continues on the Bayou Bridge Pipeline extension from Lake Charles, Louisiana, to St. James, Louisiana. The pipeline is currently operating from Nederland, Texas, to Lake Charles, and commercial operations on the extension are expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2018. The Partnership owns a 40 percent interest in the joint venture.\nThe Partnership began construction of a new 25,000 BPD isomerization unit at the Phillips 66 Lake Charles Refinery to increase production of higher octane gasoline blend components. The $200 million project includes a long-term agreement with Phillips 66 for processing services with a minimum volume commitment. Completion is expected by the end of 2019.\nThe Sand Hills Pipeline capacity was close to 400,000 BPD at the end of the first quarter. Further expansion of the line to over 450,000 BPD is expected to be completed in the second half of 2018. Sand Hills transports NGLs from the Permian Basin to the Texas Gulf Coast. Phillips 66 Partners owns a one-third interest in this joint venture.\nThe Sacagawea Pipeline joint venture is constructing a 24-mile raw natural gas pipeline system linking production in Mountrail County, North Dakota, to gathering and processing capacity in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The project is anticipated to be completed in the third quarter of 2018. Phillips 66 Partners owns a 49.5 percent interest in the joint venture.\nInvestor Webcast\nMembers of Phillips 66 Partners executive management will host a webcast today at 2 p.m. EDT to discuss the Partnership’s first-quarter performance.

Words and phrases such as “is anticipated,” “is estimated,” “is expected,” “is planned,” “is scheduled,” “is targeted,” “believes,” “continues,” “intends,” “will,” “would,” “objectives,” “goals,” “projects,” “efforts,” “strategies” and similar expressions are used to identify such forward-looking statements. However, the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements relating to Phillips 66’s operations (including joint venture operations) are based on management’s expectations, estimates and projections about the company, its interests and the energy industry in general on the date this news release was prepared. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements include the continued ability of Phillips 66 to satisfy its obligations under our commercial and other agreements; the volume of crude oil, refined petroleum products and NGL we or our joint ventures transport, fractionate, terminal and store; the tariff rates with respect to volumes that we transport through our regulated assets, which rates are subject to review and possible adjustment by federal and state regulators; fluctuations in the prices for crude oil, refined petroleum products and NGL; liabilities associated with the risks and operational hazards inherent in transporting, fractionating, terminaling and storing crude oil, refined petroleum products and NGL; potential liability from litigation or for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations under environmental regulations; and other economic, business, competitive and/or regulatory factors affecting Phillips 66 Partners’ businesses generally as set forth in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Phillips 66 Partners is under no obligation (and expressly disclaims any such obligation) to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information —This news release includes the terms “EBITDA,” “adjusted EBITDA,” “distributable cash flow,” “run-rate EBITDA,” and “coverage ratio.” These are non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are included to help facilitate comparisons of operating performance of the Partnership with other companies in our industry. EBITDA and distributable cash flow help facilitate an assessment of our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our partners. We believe that the presentation of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. Our coverage ratio is calculated as distributable cash flow divided by total cash distributions and is included to help indicate the Partnership’s ability to pay cash distributions from current earnings. The GAAP performance measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA is net income. The GAAP liquidity measure most comparable to EBITDA and distributable cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities. The GAAP financial measure most comparable to our coverage ratio is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities divided by total cash distributions. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP net income or net cash provided by operating activities. They have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities. They should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, because EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\nRun-rate adjusted EBITDA is a forecast of future EBITDA, and is based on the Partnership’s projections of annual adjusted EBITDA inclusive of both currently owned assets ($1 billion) and future potential acquisitions and organic growth by the Partnership ($1.1 billion). Run-rate adjusted EBITDA is included to demonstrate the historical growth of the Partnership through the first quarter of 2018, as well as management’s intention of future growth through acquisitions and organic projects. We are unable to present a reconciliation of targeted run-rate adjusted EBITDA to net income, which is the nearest GAAP financial measure, because certain elements of net income, including interest, depreciation and taxes, were not used in the forecasts and are therefore not available. Together, these items generally result in run-rate adjusted EBITDA being significantly greater than net income. Current run-rate adjusted EBITDA is the current quarter’s adjusted EBITDA annualized, and a reconciliation of current quarter adjusted EBITDA to net income accompanies this release. The disaggregation of capital spending between expansion/growth and maintenance is not a distinction recognized under GAAP. We provide such disaggregation because the Partnership will generally fund maintenance capital spending with cash from operating activities and fund expansion/growth capital spending with financing activities. We believe this is an important distinction in our liquidity profile.\nReferences in the release to earnings and capital spending refer to net income and capital spending attributable to the Partnership, respectively. References to EBITDA refer to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.\nResults of Operations (Unaudited)\nSummarized Financial Statement Information Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated\nQ1 2018 Q4 2017 Selected Income Statement Data Total revenues and other income $ 355 331 Net income 172 164 Net income attributable to the Partnership 172 162 Adjusted EBITDA 247 254 Distributable cash flow 194 172 Net Income Attributable to the Partnership Per Limited Partner Unit—Diluted (Dollars) Common units $ 0.87 0.83 Selected Balance Sheet Data Cash and cash equivalents $ 167 185 Equity investments 1,986 1,932 Total assets 5,386 5,334 Total debt 2,946 2,945 Equity held by public Preferred units 746 746 Common units 2,308 2,274 Equity held by Phillips 66 Common units 519 487 General partner (1,338\n)\n(1,345\n)\nStatement of Income Millions of Dollars Q1 2018 Q4 2017 Revenues and Other Income Operating revenues—related parties $ 249 246 Operating revenues—third parties 7 8 Equity in earnings of affiliates 98 76 Other income 1 1 Total revenues and other income 355 331 Costs and Expenses Operating and maintenance expenses 97 82 Depreciation 28 28 General and administrative expenses 16 17 Taxes other than income taxes 10 9 Interest and debt expense 30 29 Total costs and expenses 181 165 Income before income taxes 174 166 Income tax expense 2 2 Net income 172 164 Less: Net income attributable to Predecessors — 2 Net income attributable to the Partnership 172 162 Less: Preferred unitholders’ interest in net income attributable to the Partnership 9 9 Less: General partner’s interest in net income attributable to the Partnership 53 48 Limited partners' interest in net income attributable to the Partnership $ 110 105 Selected Operating Data Q1 2018 Q4 2017 Wholly Owned Operating Data Pipelines Pipeline revenues (millions of dollars) $ 102 110 Pipeline volumes (1) (thousands of barrels daily) Crude oil 947 968 Refined products and natural gas liquids 798 978 Total\n1,745 1,946 Average pipeline revenue per barrel (dollars) $ 0.65 0.62 Terminals Terminal revenues (millions of dollars) $ 39 40 Terminal throughput (thousands of barrels daily) Crude oil (2) 447 478 Refined products 719 798 Total\n1,166 1,276 Average terminaling revenue per barrel (dollars) $ 0.37 0.34 Storage, processing and other revenues (millions of dollars) $ 115 104 Total operating revenues (millions of dollars) $ 256\n254\nJoint Venture Operating Data (3) Crude oil, refined products and natural gas liquids (thousands of barrels daily) 603 559 (1)\nRepresents the sum of volumes transported through each separately tariffed pipeline segment.\n(2)\nBayway and Ferndale rail rack volumes included in crude oil terminals.\n(3)\nProportional share of total pipeline volumes of joint ventures consistent with recognized equity in earnings of affiliates.\nCapital Expenditures and Investments Millions of Dollars Q1 2018 Q4 2017 Capital Expenditures and Investments Expansion $ 57 106 Maintenance 12 21 Total Partnership 69 127 Predecessors — 1 Total Consolidated $ 69 128 Cash Distributions Millions of Dollars Q1 2018 Q4 2017 Cash Distributions † Common units—public $ 38 36 Common units—Phillips 66 50 46 General partner—Phillips 66 51 47 Total $ 139 129 Cash Distribution Per Common Unit (Dollars) $ 0.714 0.678 Coverage Ratio* 1.40 1.33 †Cash distributions declared attributable to the indicated periods.\n*Calculated as distributable cash flow divided by total cash distributions.
