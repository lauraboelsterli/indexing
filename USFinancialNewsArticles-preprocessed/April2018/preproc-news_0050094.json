    "text": "Yemen's armed Houthi movement fired two ballistic missiles at a Saudi Aramco facility in the southern city of Jizan on Monday, but Saudi state media said both projectiles were destroyed.\nThe Houthis' al-Masirah TV said they had targeted a port belonging to the Saudi state oil giant.\nThe Saudi state news agency Quote: d the spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition that intervened against the Houthis in Yemen's war in 2015 as saying the two missiles were intercepted over Jizan and their debris fell on residential neighborhoods.\n\"There were no casualties or damages recorded as of the time of (our) statement,\" Colonel Turki al-Maliki said.\nAramco did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe company is building a 400,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Jizan, part of a new economic city on the Red Sea, and it is expected to become fully operational in 2019.\nThe Houthis say their missile attacks on the kingdom are in retaliation for air raids on Yemen by the Western-backed coalition.\nSaudi Arabia and an alliance of Muslim states intervened in Yemen's civil war to try and push back the Houthis after they drove the internationally-recognized government into exile in Riyadh.\nAir strikes by the coalition killed at least 20 people attending a wedding in a village in northwestern Yemen late on Sunday, residents and medical sources said.\nThe coalition has carried out thousands of air strikes in Yemen that have hit schools, markets and hospitals, killing hundreds of people - though it says it does not target civilians.\nThe Yemen war has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced more than 2 million and driven the country to the verge of famine, according to the United Nations.\nThe coalition says the Houthis are armed and supported by Saudi arch-adversary Iran - charges the group and Tehran deny.",
