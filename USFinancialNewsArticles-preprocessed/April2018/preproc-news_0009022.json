But you know what? I think you're getting an opportunity to be able to say, 'OK, I don't like these master limited partnerships. Let's go.'\"\nAlibaba Group : \"Alibaba's one of just a handful of Chinese stocks that I like here. I also like Baidu and I like Baozun and I am not backing away from BABA despite some of the negativity I read today.\"\nU.S. Concrete Inc. : \"I've got to tell you, the stock is now at 12 times earnings. I think it deserves maybe a 15 multiple. The stock has come down hard. I think it's an opportunity, not a situation to run from.\"\nMicro Focus International : \"Oh, man. Enterprise application management solutions â€“ stay away. It's too hard. It's just too hard.\"\nSynchrony Financial : \"I think Synchrony's OK. My friend Bruce Kamich, who works with me at RealMoney.com, says that that Visa chart's really good, and I happen to like Visa management. I'd rather you go with Visa.\"\nAmerican Express Co. : \"Holy cow, American Express, another one I don't like as much as Visa, although I understand the story. But I would prefer Visa at $121 than American Express at $94.\"\n8X8, Inc. : \"When we first started this show 13 years ago, I liked it, but you know what, I'd rather just see you in Cisco . I think that's a better situation.\"\nWatch the full lightning round here: show chapters Cramer's lightning round: You're getting an opportunity to sell these oil stocks 18 Hours Ago | 03:24 ",
