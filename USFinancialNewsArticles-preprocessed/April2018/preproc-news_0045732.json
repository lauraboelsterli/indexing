    "text": "48% Annual Increase in Assets\nGARDEN GROVE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- US Metro Bank (OTC Pink: USMT) Mr. Dong Il Kim, President and CEO, announced the bank’s financial results for the first quarter 2018, reporting net income of $1,192,000 for the three months ending March 31, 2018 compared to $4,268,000 reported for the same three months in 2017. Earnings per share (EPS) of $0.07 per share on 16,230,000 shares for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compares to EPS of $0.26 per share on 16,130,000 shares for the same time period in 2017. Included in the three months’ 2017 income was the net of the tax benefit from reversing a $4.1 million valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset and the adjustment of $1.1 million in the deferred tax asset for the change in the Federal tax rate. The first quarter 2018 earnings reflect the lower federal tax rate, effective January 1, 2018.\nThe Bank reported total assets of $329.9 million as of March 31, 2018, representing a 48.3% increase compared to the reporting period ending March 31, 2017 and a 1.4% increase over the fourth quarter 2017. In 2017 the Bank opened a branch office on April 3, 2017 on Wilshire Boulevard in Koreatown, Los Angeles and a Loan Production Office (LPO) on June 15, 2017 in Seattle, Washington. A new branch in downtown Los Angeles’ Fashion District opened on November 1, 2017. As of March 31, 2018 the Wilshire branch recorded a total deposit base of $68.3 million including $12.5 million in non-interest bearing deposits. The new Fashion District Branch had $34.6 million in total deposits at March 31, 2018 including $9.6 million in non-interest bearing deposits. Total Bank loans totaled $228.2 million compared to $153.8 million a year earlier at March 31, 2017, a 48.4% increase and increased from $218.5 million at December 31, 2017, a 4.4% increase. Total Bank deposits ended the quarter at $276.8 million, a 57.9% increase from $175.3 million at March 31, 2017 and compares to $269.1 million at December 31, 2017, a 2.9% increase.\nSBA loan originations for the quarter ending March 31, 2018 were $19.0 million compared to $16.4 million for the first quarter in 2017. The Bank sold $18.4 million in SBA loans for a net gain of $1.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $15.0 million in SBA loan sales and a net gain of $1.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nLoan quality remains good with non-performing assets as a percent of total assets of 0.05% compared to 0.0% as of March 31, 2017. The Bank had no Other Real Estate Owned at March 31, 2018. Allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) to gross loans has decreased from 2.15% as of March 31, 2017 to 1.50% as of March 31, 2018. The reason for the decrease is a 48.4% annual growth in loans from March 31, 2017. Accordingly the Bank booked $100,000 of provision expense in the first quarter, 2018 as a result of the loan growth.\n“The Board of Directors is pleased with the continued growth and profitability of the Bank while absorbing the new Wilshire Branch, Seattle LPO and the Fashion District Branch in Downtown Los Angeles,” said CEO Kim. “We are excited about continuing the growth of the Bank in 2018 and look forward to the future profitable deployment our new capital.”\nUS Metro Bank is a California chartered, full service commercial nonmember bank headquartered in Garden Grove, California, with four branch offices in California - Garden Grove, Anaheim, Koreatown/Los Angeles, Fashion District/Los Angeles - and loan production offices in Dallas, Texas, and Seattle, Washington.
