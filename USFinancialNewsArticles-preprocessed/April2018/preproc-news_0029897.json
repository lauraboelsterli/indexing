    "text": "April 15, 2018 / 5:42 AM / in 40 minutes Games-Sensational Brazier try gives NZ women rugby sevens gold Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nGOLD COAST, Australia, April 15 (Reuters) - New Zealand’s Kelly Brazier ran almost 60 metres to score in the corner in sudden-death extra time to beat Olympic champions Australia 17-12 and clinch the first Commonwealth Games women’s sevens gold medal at Robina Stadium in Gold Coast on Sunday. \nNew Zealand had opened up a 12-0 halftime lead after tries to Portia Woodman and Michaela Blyde before the Australians came storming back in the second half. \nEmilee Cherry exploited some poor tackling close to the line before Ellia Green outpaced the cover defence to level the scores and send it into extra time. \nThe Australians, who had won the first Olympic gold medal in Rio in 2016 and dominated this season’s women’s sevens series, had been heavy favourites heading into the final between the trans-Tasman rivals. \nThe two sides had also met in the final of the Rio Olympics, with the Australians claiming the gold. \nEngland had earlier won both bronze medals with the men beating Glasgow Games champions South Africa 21-14 while the women beat Canada 24-19.
