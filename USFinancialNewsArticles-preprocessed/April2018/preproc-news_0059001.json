    "text": "CORTLAND, Ohio, April 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nCortland Bancorp (OTCQB:CLDB), the holding company for Cortland Savings and Banking Company, today reported net income of $1.5 million, or $0.35 per share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $1.0 million, or $0.23 per share for the first quarter of 2017. All results are unaudited.\n“Following the expense reduction measures throughout 2017, combined with our continued expansion in new markets and continued strong loan growth, we are pleased to report our 2018 first quarter earnings. We are optimistic that the solid start in 2018 will continue through the remainder of the year,” said James Gasior, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The market expansion has translated into higher revenues, while the expense reduction has resulted in a substantially improved efficiency ratio. When combined with the lower tax rate in 2018, the Return on Assets improved to .91% from .63% a year ago, while the Return on Average Equity increased to 10.13% from 6.94% over the same period.”\n“With this improved performance, we also approved today the recently increased dividend of $0.11 per share. With the intent of increasing shareholder value, the higher dividend level combined with opportunistic share repurchases allow the Company to provide increased returns to shareholders.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights (at, or for the period ended March 31, 2018);\nEarnings per share was $0.35, compared to $0.23 for the first quarter of 2017, and $0.01 for the fourth quarter of 2017. Fourth quarter results were impacted by the passage of the tax law, known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” which replaces the top rate of 35% with a new 21% top rate.\nNet interest income increased 13% to $5.6 million, compared to $4.9 million for the first quarter a year ago, and increased 6% from $5.3 million on a linked quarter basis.\nNon-interest income was $1 million, compared to $.9 million for both the first and the fourth quarters of 2017.\nAverage Total loans grew 15% to $469 million from $408 million for the first quarter a year ago, and 10% from $428 million from the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAverage Total deposits grew 8% to $561 million from the comparable quarter a year earlier and 4% from the previous quarter.\nNonperforming assets were 1.56% of total assets versus 1.41% a year ago.\nCortland Bancorp remained well capitalized with total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets of 14.12% and tangible equity to tangible assets of 9.07%.\nA quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per share will be payable on June 1, 2018 to shareholders of record on May 14, 2018, providing a 2% current yield at recent market prices.\nOperating Results\nNet Interest Income\nThe 13% increase in net interest income over the first quarter of 2017 was the primarily the result of the substantial loan growth in the fourth quarter of 2017. Additionally, the rate hikes initiated by the Federal Reserve, one each in December and March, has contributed to increase the yield on loans.\nNet interest margin was 3.62%, compared to 3.52% for the first quarter a year ago and 3.65% for the fourth quarter of 2017. “The tax equivalent yield will be lower beginning in 2018, reflecting the tax rate reduction from 34% to 21%,” said David Lucido, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nNoninterest Income\nAll categories of noninterest income improved over results a year ago. Mortgage originations were $12 million, generating gains on sale of mortgages of $238,000, versus $8.2 million in originations and $194,000 in gains in the first quarter of 2017. Continued expansion into other Ohio markets has aided the improvement in volume.\nOperating Expenses\nNon-interest expense was $4.3 million, compared to $4.6 million for both the like quarter a year ago and the preceding quarter. “The cost cutting measures addressed in 2017 are having a positive effect on 2018 results,” explained Lucido.\n“We recently executed a workforce realignment, as a result of a comprehensive business review to increase operational efficiencies, improve financial performance and strengthen the Company’s value proposition,” added Gasior. “Coupled with the mid-2017 branch consolidation and additional targeted expense reductions planned for 2018, the Company expects to recognize a meaningful improvement in its efficiency ratio.”\nThe efficiency ratio for the first quarter of 2018 was 64.66%, compared to 76.63% for the first quarter a year earlier and 71.13% for the fourth quarter of 2017.\n“The effective tax rate was 13.6%, compared to 16.0% for the first quarter of 2017, reflecting the benefits of the Tax Act and the tax-free components of our revenue stream,” added Lucido.\nBalance Sheet and Asset Quality\nTotal assets were $663 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $620 million at March 31, 2017, and $711 million at December 31, 2017.\n“We had a very strong quarter of loan production in the fourth quarter of 2017 which is a springboard for our performance here in the first quarter,” commented Gasior. Total loans increased 8% last quarter, exclusive of $43 million of seasonal short-term production. When combined with an additional 1.7% growth in the current quarter, the loan to deposit ratio has increased to just over 81% from 77% a year ago. Average loan balances, which help smooth out some of the seasonal impact, increased 10% on a linked quarter basis and 15% year-over-year.\nThe loan portfolio remains diversified and comprise of both retail and business relationships with commercial real estate loans accounting for 62.9%, of which 16.9% were owner-occupied by businesses. Commercial loans accounted for 16.7% while residential 1-4 loans accounted for 14.0%. “Our loan production remains solid, benefiting from the expansion into other Ohio markets,” added Gasior.\nTotal deposits grew by $37.2 million, or 7%, to $554.5 million at March 31, 2018, from $517.4 million at March 31, 2017. Excluding $43 million of seasonal short-term accounts at year-end 2017, deposits grew by $11.6 million or 2.1% on a linked quarter basis. Noninterest-bearing deposits accounted for 22.3% of total deposits; while certificates of deposits were 22.0% of the deposit mix. “The Kasasa free checking account program continues to be successful with more than 4,000 accounts now opened. Online account opening was launched allowing customers to open a Rewards Kasasa account on their computer or mobile device,” commented Gasior.\nNonperforming loans were $9.3 million, compared to $7.4 million a year earlier and $5.1 million, at December 31, 2017. Driving the higher balance this quarter was the restructuring of a $5.4 million relationship which triggered a $1.2 million charge-off relating to the interest rate concession granted. The Company enjoyed provision-free results in four of the past five quarters due to significant loan recoveries. A provision for loan losses of $500,000 was recorded in the current quarter.\nPerforming restructured loans, that were not included in nonaccrual loans at the end of the first quarter of 2017, were $8.3 million, including the above referenced relationship, compared to $4.4 million a year ago and $4.2 million on a linked quarter basis.\nCapital\nCortland Bancorp continues to remain well capitalized under all regulatory measures, with capital ratios exceeding the statutory well-capitalized thresholds by an ample margin.
