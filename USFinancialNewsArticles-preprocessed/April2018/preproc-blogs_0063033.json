All CFO Journal-produced content can be accessed without a subscription.\nT-Mobile US President and CEO John Legere answers questions during the company’s Q1 earnings call in Bellevue, Wash., U.S., April 24, 2017. AP Good morning. Company executives struck several large deals during the weekend, highlighting the need to consolidate at a time of technological disruption and heightened competition across various industries.\nT-Mobile US Inc. inked a $26 billion deal to buy Sprint Corp. in a combination that, if allowed by antitrust regulators, would leave the U.S. wireless market dominated by three national players. New technology, stiff competition from wireless rivals and an aging cellphone sector keep driving Sprint and T-Mobile into each other’s arms, report the WSJ’s Drew FitzGerald, Dana Cimilluca and and Dana Mattioli.\nIn the U.K., supermarket operator J Sainsbury PLC agreed to buy Walmart Inc.’s Asda Group Ltd. in a deal that values the chain at about $10.1 billion and would, if successful, create the largest player in the country’s fiercely competitive grocery market. Walmart is increasingly challenged by online retailers including Amazon.com Inc. and follows a strategy to form joint ventures in competitive markets and focus investments in areas executives think will provide growth, writes the WSJ’s Saabira Chaudhuri.\nAmid surging e-commerce sales, Prologis Inc. agreed to buy logistics-property owner DCT Industrial Trust Inc. for $8.4 billion including debt. The rise in online shopping ramps up demand for warehouses and distribution centers, report Ms. Mattioli and Jennifer Smith.\nBut not just consumer-facing industries are under pressure to consolidate. Marathon Petroleum Corp. , the U.S.’s second largest refiner, plans to buy pipeline and refining company Andeavor for more than $20 billion, the companies said Monday. The deal is expected to produce $1 billion of synergies, write Ms. Cimilluca and Ms. Mattioli.\nTHE DAY AHEAD\nClosing arguments in DoJ vs. AT&T-case. With closing arguments set for Monday, the U.S. Justice Department has a final chance to frame its arguments against the planned tie-up between AT&T Inc. and Time Warner Inc. after five weeks of testimony featuring few major revelations.\nArconic Inc. , AK Steel Holding Corp. , Akamai Technologies Inc. and McDonald’s Corp. are among the companies slated to report earnings today.\nTHE WEEK AHEAD\nU.S. jobs report and spending, eurozone inflation. In the week ahead, the U.S. will see data on personal income and spending (Monday) and the April jobs report (Friday). Overseas, inflation figures from the eurozone are due (Thursday), and Brazil’s central bank will release numbers on the country’s fiscal situation (Monday).\nCFO JOURNAL EXCLUSIVE\nNorfolk Southern uses analytics to keep trains on track. Norfolk Southern Corp. has ramped up its use of data analytics to boost operations as well as back-office functions over the past year, Chief Financial Officer Cynthia Earhart told CFO Journal’s Ezequiel Minaya.\nMs. Earhart, previously the company’s chief information officer, said she has introduced a new method of revenue forecasting that incorporates more macroeconomic indicators. And diving into a deep pool of data about how the company’s trains are running is helping her decide how to allocate funds in areas such as maintenance, she said.\nThe revenue-forecasting system, a mix of new technologies and processes, was developed internally and uses macroeconomic data to be more predictive, Ms. Earhart said.\nPreviously, the process of revenue forecasting was a more “bottom-up” process that focused on individual customer’s needs, said Ms. Earhart, a more than 30-year veteran of the railroad.\nCORPORATE NEWS\nYouTube signage is displayed on a monitor in Los Angeles, Calif., U.S., Feb. 28, 2017. Bloomberg News Google to sell YouTube ads. Alphabet Inc.’s Google is aiming to improve the quality of ad-supported content in its Google Preferred program by adding inventory from YouTube TV, a streaming service that packages a host of popular TV channels.\nIn Europe, Amazon remains out of fashion. Amazon might look like it’s taking over the world. But it hasn’t conquered Europe. Two decades after the internet behemoth’s first international foray into the region, it’s still working to gain traction selling apparel and footwear.\nSamsung to simplify ownership structure. Samsung Electronics Co. plans to drastically simplify the conglomerate’s ownership structure in coming months, according to people familiar with the matter, untangling a controversial web that has long been criticized for benefiting the ruling Lee family at the expense of minority shareholders.\nPimco pushes further into real-estate debt. Pacific Investment Management Co. is raising money for a new, multibillion-dollar commercial real-estate debt fund, the bond manager’s latest foray into more lucrative — and less liquid — markets, people familiar with the matter said.\nBaidu gets fresh ammunition to challenge fintech rivals. Baidu Inc.’s former financial-services unit has attracted a $1.9 billion investment from firms including U.S. private-equity giants TPG Capital and The Carlyle Group LP , giving it fresh ammunition to compete in China’s increasingly crowded financial-services space.\nSaudi Aramco in board overhaul. State-oil giant Saudi Arabian Oil Co. reshuffled its board, adding five members including its first-ever female director, as it prepares for a public listing.\nWPP beats forecasts. WPP PLC on Monday said revenue declined in the first quarter as clients spent less in North America, but the advertising giant beat analysts’ more-pessimistic forecasts in its first financial update since founder and Chief Executive Martin Sorrell unexpectedly departed.\nNoble plans to seek vote on debt restructuring. Noble Group Ltd. on Sunday said it plans to soon start the process for holding a special meeting of shareholders to vote on the embattled commodity trader’s debt-restructuring plan, despite a court blocking it from holding its annual shareholders meeting this week, reports Reuters.\nSEB profit declines. Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB on Monday posted a drop in first-quarter net profit as business sentiment subsided in the quarter while more volatile equity markets made private individuals more cautious, reports MarketWatch.\nREGULATION\nU.S. tax overhaul weakens case to shift profits overseas. The U.S. tax law passed in December aimed to remove the features of the old tax system that gave American companies a strong incentive to put their profits, factories and headquarters overseas. Tax experts say the new rules will work — but with limitations and caveats.\nECONOMY\nSteel coils are stored at the Thyssenkrupp steel factory in Duisburg, Germany, April 27, 2018. AP Metal buyers race to secure supplies ahead of tariff decision. Manufacturers are racing to shore up supplies of steel and aluminum, as the Trump administration considers an end to some tariff exemptions on Tuesday that could tighten supplies and drive up prices of both metals.\nForeign investors lose hunger for U.S. debt. Foreign investors’ appetite this year for U.S. debt hasn’t grown at the same pace as the government’s borrowing needs, which some analysts worry could push bond yields higher and eventually threaten to slow economic growth.\nAmericans’ confidence drops slightly. Americans’ confidence in the economy slipped this month but remains high compared with historical levels. The University of Michigan said Friday its index of consumer sentiment dropped 2.6 points from a month earlier to a reading of 98.8 in April. Still, that figure was nearly 2 points above the level posted a year ago.\nEurozone bank lending picks up. Bank lending to eurozone businesses and households picked up in March, data from the European Central Bank showed on Monday, in a sign that the region’s economic upswing has continued to broaden, reports MarketWatch.\nCold shipping in hot demand. One of the shipping industry’s hottest markets is cold boxes.
