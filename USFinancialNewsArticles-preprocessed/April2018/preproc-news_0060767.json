    "text": "22 COMMENTS From “ Our Self-Obsessed, Parochial Press Corps ” by Kelly Jane Torrance, WeeklyStandard.com, April 27:\nAmb. Michael Kozak from the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor answers questions on the release of the 2017 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices at the State Department in Washington, April 20. Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images There’s nothing the media love more than a story about themselves. . . . A particularly shameless example of this never-ending navel-gazing was a briefing the State Department held last week upon the release of its 2017 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices. . . .\nMost members of the media who questioned Michael Kozak, a senior official in the State Department’s bureau of democracy, human rights, and labor, weren’t interested in hearing about the horrors faced by men, women, and children raped, tortured, and murdered by governments around the world. Neither were they curious about what effect the reports might have on those governments or on the policymakers and diplomats in our own. No, they wanted to talk about themselves.\nThe first question came from the Associated Press’s Matt Lee, whose reporting is distributed to outlets across the country and beyond. “I realize that this report doesn’t cover the United States,” he said as he began his query—which focused almost entirely on the United States. “I’m just wondering how effective you think that you can be in leading by example when you accuse numerous countries of, say, assaults on press freedom when here in this country we have a president who routinely excoriates the press, calling individual media outlets—and individual reporters sometimes—fake news,” he asked. “How do you not open yourself up to charges of hypocrisy?”\nKozak gave a clear answer, free of bureaucratese: “The countries that we criticize for limiting press freedom, it’s for things like having criminal libel laws where you can be put in jail for what you say. It’s for things like yanking the licenses of media outlets you don’t like or, in many cases, killing the journalists,” he said. “So I think we make quite a distinction between political leaders being able to speak out and say that that story was not accurate or using even stronger words sometimes, and using state power to prevent the journalists from continuing to do their work.”",
