    "text": " 47 p.m. ET Share\nIsraeli prime minister says 2015 nuclear deal built on lies Reuters Israeli Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks during a news conference Monday in Tel Aviv, Israel.\nBy Felicia Schwartz\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented what he called new evidence that Iran maintained a secret and comprehensive plan to build nuclear weapons but lied repeatedly about it, building a case against the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.\nThe broadside by Netanyahu on Monday, broadcast in Israel and the U.S., came as President Donald Trump nears a May 12 deadline to decide whether to withdraw from the deal, which halted Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for economic benefits. Netanyahu said the agreement was a mistake and urged Trump to do “the right thing.”\nRead: Here’s why Netanyahu’s Iran allegations shook up the oil market\nNetanyahu said the documents obtained by Israel, which he said included 100,000 files on paper and discs, show that “Iran is brazenly lying when it says it never had a nuclear weapons program.”\nTrump said later that he agreed the 2015 nuclear agreement was a mistake, adding it would allow Iran to resume nuclear activities in seven years. “That is just not an acceptable situation,” Trump said at a news conference with Nigeria’s president, after he was asked about Netanyahu’s presentation.",
