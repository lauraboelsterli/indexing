    "text": "FREMONT, Calif., April 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AXT, Inc.

In addition, a favorable product mix and good manufacturing yields combined for increased gross margin. Regarding our Dingxing facility, we completed the first phase of facilitization, installed wafer processing equipment and produced initial wafers that can be used for qualification. We continue to execute our plans, supported by a healthy market environment and solid customer relationships. We are encouraged by the opportunities unfolding across our portfolio, as well as our readiness to participate in them.”\nConference Call\nThe company will host a conference call to discuss these results today at 1:30 p.m. PT.
