    "text": "PARIS, April 8 (Reuters) - The French government is planning to sell a stake of around 50 percent in national lottery company Francaise des Jeux (FDJ) via a stock market listing as it kicks off a wave of privatisations, the Journal du Dimanche reported on Sunday.\nThe government has announced plans to sell 10 billion euros ($12.28 billion) worth of stakes in state-owned companies to raise money for a new fund to finance innovation, an election pledge of President Emmanuel Macron.\nThe lottery company has long been flagged as one of the first candidates for a privatisation.\nInvestment bank BNP Paribas as well as law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP were mandated by France's state holding company APE to pave the way for a sale of FDJ, which is 72 percent owned by the government.\nThe state had finally opted to open the sale up to the public through a stock market flotation, in an overhaul of the FDJ that should be finalised no later than early 2019, the Journal du Dimanche (JDD) reported, citing sources.\nThe French state would retain a stake of close to 25 percent in the company, Europe's second-biggest lottery after Italy's Lottomatica, while a private investor hailing from the gaming or media sector could also take a slice of the capital, the JDD said.\nThe economy ministry declined to comment, while the state holding company APE could not immediately be reached for comment.
