    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian lawmakers said on Friday they had drafted legislation in response to new U.S. sanctions that would give the authorities the power to ban or restrict imports of a raft of U.S. goods and services to Russia.\nNational flags of Russia and the U.S. fly at Vnukovo International Airport in Moscow, Russia April 11, 2017. REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov Below are the goods that can be banned and cooperation areas which could be affected by the legislation:\nIMPORTS OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD PRODUCTS Many U.S. agricultural imports to Russia have been banned since 2014 as part of wider restrictions Moscow imposed on Western food in retaliation for international sanctions over Ukraine. The products banned include milk and dairy, beef, pork, poultry, fish, fruit, vegetables, and nuts.\nNew restrictions could affect food products which have not been targeted by the existing ban, such as tea, coffee, confectionery, although no detailed list was unveiled.\nAccording to the Russian Agriculture Ministry, U.S. imports of agricultural products stood at $930 million in 2017.\nIMPORTS OF ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO PRODUCTS Russia imports U.S. spirits including whiskeys Jim Beam and Brown-Forman’s Jack Daniels. U.S. cigarette brands are mostly produced locally.\nU.S. imports of tobacco products and hard liquor to Russia amounted to $76 million and $53 million respectively last year, the Russian Agriculture Ministry said.\nIMPORTS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS The proposed measures envisage a full or partial ban on imports of U.S. pharmaceutical products, with the exception given to drugs that have no alternatives produced in Russia or elsewhere.\nThe lawmakers said “any other” U.S.-made products could be banned, without elaborating. The list has to be defined by the Russian government.\nTECHNOLOGICAL EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE Russia may ban state entities from procuring U.S. technological equipment and software, potentially targeting Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Cisco and others.\nCONSULTING AND AUDIT The measures include a proposed ban for U.S. companies or companies in which U.S. direct or indirect ownership exceeds 25 percent to provide consulting, audit and legal services to Russian state and municipal entities.\nRUSSIAN EXPORTS OF RARE EARTH METALS TO USA The measures include restrictions on Russian exports of products and equipment made of rare earth metals. A Russian senator said on Friday that could mean a ban on titanium exports from VSMPO-Avisama to Boeing.\nMUTUAL COOPERATION The proposed measures suggest Russia should suspend cooperation with the United States on atomic energy, rocket engines and aircraft manufacturing.\nThe latter could have an impact on Irkut’s MS-21 medium-range passenger plane, powered by engines supplied by Pratt & Whitney which is owned by Connecticut-based United Technologies Corp. Irkut’s state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation declined comment.\nRussian state nuclear corporation Rosatom is also a major supplier of enriched uranium to the United States. Russia supplies meet around 20 percent of U.S. uranium needs. Rosatom also cooperates with General Electric Co on turbines through GE’s French subsidiary Alstom.\nThe new legislation could also hurt the U.S.-Russia initiative to prevent nuclear terrorism.\nRUSSIAN PRIVATIZATION Russian lawmakers suggest Russia should ban U.S. companies or entities in which U.S. companies have more than 25 percent from taking part in privatization of state and municipal assets.\nSuch companies also should not help arrange Russian privatization deals - a measure likely targeting U.S. investment banks J.P.Morgan, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley\nAIR NAVIGATION The lawmakers suggested raising air navigation services charges for U.S. planes using the Russian airspace.\nReporting by Maria Kiselyova, Polina Devitt and Gleb Stolyarov; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ",
