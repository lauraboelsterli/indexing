    "text": "NEW YORK, April 4 (Reuters) - Dan Ivascyn, group chief investment officer at Pacific Investment Management Co, said Wednesday that the late-cycle deficit spending “increases the risk of an eventual hard landing for the economy by forcing the Federal Reserve to be more proactive.”\nSpeaking to Reuters, Ivascyn, who helps oversee over $1.75 trillion at Pimco, also said of a prospective trade war with China: “A more aggressive trade war is not necessarily bad for high-quality bonds as it will likely lead to a weaker business environment and even lead to reduced household confidence which in turn mean a weaker economic backdrop. You could see a flight-to-quality into bonds under this scenario.” (Reporting by Jennifer Ablan Editing by Susan Thomas)\n ",
