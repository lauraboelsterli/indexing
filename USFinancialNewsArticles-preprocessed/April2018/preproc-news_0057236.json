    "text": "YORKTOWN HEIGHTS, N.Y., April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PCSB Financial Corporation (the “Company”) (NASDAQ:PCSB), parent of PCSB Bank (the \"Bank\"), today announced net income of $2.2 million, or $0.13 per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $2,000, or $0.00 per basic and diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and $1.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. For the nine months ended March 31, 2018, net income was $3.9 million, or $0.23 per basic and diluted share, compared to $5.0 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017. Results for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 include a $1.6 million tax re-measurement charge associated with federal tax law changes enacted in the second quarter.\nThe following nonrecurring items were recorded in the periods indicated:\nIn connection with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company recorded a $1.6 million charge to income tax expense for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, including a $182,000 benefit recorded in the current quarter, primarily reflecting a write-down of our deferred tax assets resulting from a decrease in the corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21%. A $173,000 pre-tax gain on sale of securities recorded during the nine months ended March 31, 2018. A $919,000 pre-tax curtailment of the Bank’s defined benefit plan resulting in a reduction to the salaries and benefits component of noninterest expense recorded in the three and nine months ended March 31, 2017. A $1.6 million settlement on an acquired loan included in other noninterest income in the nine months ended March 31, 2017. A $521,000 lease write-down expense in the nine months ended March 31, 2017.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the nonrecurring items discussed above, the Company recorded net income of $2.0 million and $5.4 million for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018, or $0.12 and $0.32 per diluted share, respectively. This compares to non-GAAP net income of $1.3 and $3.7 million for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2017. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP measures begin on page 12.\nEffective April 20, 2017, PCSB Bank completed its mutual-to-stock conversion and the Company completed its related initial public offering. Accordingly, financial results for dates and periods prior to April 20, 2017 are for the Bank only.\nPresident’s Comments\nCommenting on the Company's results, Joseph D. Roberto, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of PCSB Financial Corporation, said, \"I am proud of the Company's accomplishment as we bring to a close our one-year anniversary as a public company. Some of these accomplishments include a $77.1 million (9.5%) increase in net loans from June 30, 2017, along with a 15.0% increase in net interest income leading to continued earnings growth and operating efficiency. Additionally, we continue to reduce problem assets as the Bank's non-performing asset to total assets declined to 0.50% at March 31, 2018 from 0.91% at June 30, 2017. These results continue to follow our strategy to leverage our capital in a safe and disciplined way in order to maximize stockholder value. We also continue to be focused on capital management and I am pleased to announce our first quarterly cash dividend of $0.03 per share.\"\nIncome Statement Summary\nNet interest income increased $1.2 million, or 13.2%, to $10.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017 and decreased $43,000 from the previous quarter. The increase in net interest income compared to the prior year is a result of a $172.6 million increase in average net interest earning assets and a 3 basis point increase in the net interest margin. The increase in net interest earning assets is due to the Company deploying the capital raised in the initial public offering into loans receivable and investments. The net interest margin was 2.99% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, increasing from 2.96% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and down slightly from 3.00% for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nThe provision for loan losses decreased $181,000 to $54,000 for the three months March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 due to increases in specific reserves on impaired loans in the prior year period. The provision for loan losses decreased $146,000 compared to prior quarter due primarily to recoveries realized in the current quarter. Recoveries, net of charge-offs, were $99,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to charge-offs net of recoveries, of $997,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and $33,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Loans classified as substandard and doubtful decreased $1.0 million or 5.2% to $19.6 million at March 31, 2018 from $20.6 million at December 31, 2017 and decreased $5.6 million or 22.2% from $25.1 million at June 30, 2017. Non-performing loans were 0.80% of gross loans as of March 31, 2018, down from 0.97% as of December 31, 2017 and 1.48% as of June 30, 2017.\nNoninterest income decreased $114,000 to $512,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to higher loan-related fees earned in the prior year period, and decreased $180,000 from the three months ended December 31, 2017, due primarily to higher loan-related fees and nonrecurring rental income on the settlement of a nonperforming asset earned in the prior quarter.\nNoninterest expense increased $1.3 million to $7.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 and decreased $292,000 from the three months ended December 31, 2017. The $1.3 million increase was caused primarily by increases in salaries and employee benefits, primarily reflecting a $919,000 curtailment gain recognized in the prior year period related to the defined benefit pension plan, $192,000 of net increases in other retirement expenses, including ESOP expense which commenced in April 2017, and a $181,000 increase in salaries expense due primarily to increased staffing. Additionally, salaries and employee benefits expense increased $2.2 million to $14.4 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $1.8 million increase in ESOP expense and a $598,000 increase due to additional headcount, partially offset by a $73,000 net decrease in defined benefit pension and other retirement plan costs. Occupancy expense and other operating expenses were unchanged compared to the prior year quarter as increases in Director and Officer insurance expense and other professional fees associated with being a public company were offset by lower FDIC assessments and expenses on foreclosed real estate. The $292,000 decrease in noninterest expense from the three months ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to a loss recorded on a receivable in the three months ended December 31, 2017 as well as lower advertising costs.\nIncome tax expense decreased $287,000 or 32.7% to $591,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 due to a $182,000 tax benefit from the adjustment of the re-measurement charge associated with the recent tax reform and the related reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21%. The effective income tax rate was 21.4% (27.9% excluding the effects of the current quarter re-measurement charge) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to 31.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Income tax expense decreased $2.0 million compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017 due primarily to the $1.8 million deferred tax re-measurement charge recorded in the prior quarter.\nBalance Sheet Summary\nTotal assets increased $30.5 million to $1.46 billion at March 31, 2018 from $1.43 billion at June 30, 2017. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $77.1 million in net loans receivable, partially offset by decreases of $24.0 million and $21.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and total investment securities, respectively. The $77.1 million increase in net loans included increases of $47.2 million in commercial mortgage loans, $36.1 million in residential mortgage loans, and $2.6 million in commercial loans, partially offset by decreases of $6.3 million in construction loans and $3.7 million in home equity lines of credit. Loan growth was funded by decreases in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities, as well as increased FHLB advances.\nTotal liabilities increased $25.7 million to $1.17 billion at March 31, 2018 from $1.15 billion at June 30, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a $26.3 million increase in advances from FHLB.\nTotal shareholders’ equity increased $4.9 million to $284.7 million at March 31, 2018 from $279.8 million at June 30, 2017. This increase was primarily due to net income of $3.9 million and a $1.7 million reduction in unearned ESOP shares for plan shares earned during the period, partially offset by other comprehensive losses of $861,000 due largely to increased unrealized losses in the available for sale investment securities portfolio driven by increased market interest rates. At March 31, 2018, the Company’s book value per share and tangible book value per share were $15.67 and $15.31, respectively, compared to $15.41 and $15.04, respectively, at June 30, 2017. For reconciliations of book value per share (GAAP measure) to tangible book value per share (non-GAAP measure), see page 14. At March 31, 2018, the Bank was considered “well capitalized” under applicable regulatory guidelines.\nDividend\nThe Board of Directors has declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.03 per share. The dividend is payable on or about May 25, 2018 to stockholders of record on May 11, 2018.\nAbout PCSB Financial Corporation and PCSB Bank\nPCSB Financial Corporation is the bank holding company for PCSB Bank.

(2) Adjusted efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as noninterest expense, less certain nonrecurring items, divided by our operating revenue, which is equal to net interest income plus non-interest income excluding certain nonrecurring items. In our judgment, the adjustments made to operating revenue allow investors and analysts to better assess our operating expenses in relation to our core operating revenue by removing the impact of certain one-time items and other discrete items that are unrelated to our core business. (3) Represents average shareholders' equity divided by average total assets. (4) Tangible book value per share is a non-GAAP measure and equals total shareholders’ equity, less goodwill and other intangible assets, divided by shares outstanding. We believe this disclosure may be meaningful to those investors who seek to evaluate our equity without giving effect to goodwill and other intangible assets. (5) Represents Bank ratios.
