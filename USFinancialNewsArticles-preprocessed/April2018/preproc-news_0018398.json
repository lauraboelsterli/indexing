    "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif., April 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Heritage Commerce Corp (NASDAQ:HTBK) (“Heritage”) today announced that today it completed its previously announced merger of its wholly-owned bank subsidiary Heritage Bank of Commerce with Tri-Valley Bank (“Tri-Valley”) effective as of the close of business on April 6, 2018. The merger, which was first announced on December 20, 2017, was concluded following receipt of approval from Tri-Valley shareholders and all required regulatory approvals. Tri-Valley was a full-service California state-chartered commercial bank with branches in San Ramon and Livermore, California and served businesses and individuals primarily in the counties of Contra Costa and Alameda in Northern California. As of March 31, 2018, Tri-Valley had $150.3 million in assets, $131.4 million in deposits, and $125.2 million in net loans.\nWalter T. Kaczmarek, President and Chief Executive Officer of Heritage commented, “We are pleased to announce the completion of our merger with Tri-Valley. We are excited about enhancing our franchise footprint and intend to broaden customer relationships in the area through our enhanced product offerings.”\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, Tri-Valley shareholders received a fixed exchange ratio of 0.0489 of a share of Heritage common stock in exchange for each share of Tri-Valley common stock. As a result of the merger, Heritage issued approximately 1.9 million shares of Heritage common stock to the former holders of Tri-Valley common, constituting approximately 4.7% of the outstanding shares of Heritage common stock immediately after the merger. Immediately prior to the closing, Tri-Valley option holders and an outstanding warrant were cashed out in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement.\nArnold Grisham, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Tri-Valley stated, “The Tri-Valley and Heritage combination presents an exciting strategic opportunity for our stakeholders. Our teams are working well together to provide for a smooth transition.”\nMJC Partners, LLC, was the financial advisor to Heritage in the transaction. Buchalter, a professional corporation, Los Angeles, California, was legal counsel to Heritage. FIG Partners acted as financial advisor to Tri-Valley. Sheppard Mullin Richter & Hampton LLP, San Francisco, California was legal counsel to Tri-Valley.\nAbout Heritage Commerce Corp and Heritage Bank of Commerce\nHeritage Commerce Corp, a California corporation organized in 1998, is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended.
