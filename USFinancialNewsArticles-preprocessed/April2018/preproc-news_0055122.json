    "text": "CELAYA, Mexico, April 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Industrias Bachoco, S.A.B. de C.V., \"Bachoco\" or \"the Company\", (NYSE: IBA; BMV: Bachoco) announced today its unaudited results for the first quarter (\"1Q18\") ending March 31, 2018. All figures have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standard (\"IFRS\"), and are presented in nominal million Mexican Pesos (\"$\"), except earnings per share.\nHIGHLIGHTS- 2018 vs. 2017\nNet sales increased 11.8% in 1Q18. EBITDA margin was 13.7% in 1Q18 vs 8.8% in 1Q17, our EBITDA was $2,100.2 million, 74.5% more than in the 1Q17. Earnings per basic and diluted share were $2.09.\nCEO COMMENTS\nMr. Rodolfo Ramos Arvizu, Chief Executive Officer of Bachoco, stated, \"In Mexico, this first quarter started strong. We believe that after the natural events that affected the economic dynamic in some regions of the country, demand for poultry products resumed its normal levels and combined with a moderate supply increase, allowed a balance supply – demand in the market. We did not see oversupply conditions as occurred in 1Q17.\nThe prices of our main raw material were stable, but we saw some volatility, mainly in soybean meal, in the second part of the quarter.\nIn the US market, we observed stable conditions when compared with the same quarter of last year. We continued with our process of integrating our 2017 acquisition and to capture synergies.\nSales and volume of our main product lines continued growing in both markets, which led us to an increase of 11.8% in total sales for 1Q18 when compared to the same quarter of 2017.\nFor 1Q18, we reached an EBITDA of $2,100.2 for 13.7% margin. This EBITDA represents an increase of 74.5% when compared with the 1Q17. Earnings per basic and diluted shares were $2.09 for the quarter.\nThe Company remained in a healthy financial condition as we reached a net cash level of $12,993.4 million, which will allow us to continue the support of our growth plans.\nWe will remain focused on continuous improvements and efficiencies across all of our processes and working close to our customers.\"\nExecutive Summary\nThe following financial information is expressed in millions of nominal pesos, except for amounts per share and per ADR, with comparative figures for the same periods of 2017.\nQUARTERLY RESULTS\nNET SALES BY GEOGRAPHY\nIn millions of pesos\n1Q18\n1Q17\nChange\n$\n$\n$\n%\nNet sales\n15,303.0\n13,684.9\n1,618.1\n11.8\nNet sales in Mexico\n11,091.5\n9,949.3\n1,142.2\n11.5\nNet sales in the U.S.\n4,211.5\n3,735.6\n475.9\n12.7\nNET SALES BY SEGMENT\nIn millions of pesos\n1Q18\n1Q17\nChange\n$\n$\n$\n%\nNet sales\n15,303.0\n13,684.9\n1,618.1\n11.8\nPoultry\n13,774.5\n12,286.6\n1,487.9\n12.1\nOther\n1,528.4\n1,398.3\n130.1\n9.3\nNET VOLUME SOLD BY SEGMENT\nIn tons\nChange\n1Q18\n1Q17\nVolume\n%\nTotal sales volume:\n546,750\n528,099\n18,651\n3.53\nPoultry\n422,181\n419,219\n2,963\n0.71\nOthers\n124,569\n108,880\n15,689\n14.41\nIn 1Q18, the Company's net sales totaled $15,303.0 million; $1,618.1 million or 11.8% more than $13,684.9 million reported in 1Q17.
