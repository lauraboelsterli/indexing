    "text": "25 COMMENTS It’s not…nothing.\nLook, it would be fun to dump all over this, the NCAA’s latest clean-up initiative —it’s always fun to poke at the lumbering ol’ NCAA—but it wouldn’t be completely fair. Wednesday’s proposal from Condoleezza Rice and the recently-formed Commission on College Basketball contained more than a few good, if wildly overdue, recommendations.\nPushing the NBA to get rid of “one-and-done”: great! (Though college players leaving after one season is a function of the NBA’s 19-year-old age minimum, and changing the policy is entirely up to the NBA and its players association, so basically this is like me proposing that pizza should be free.) Allowing players to retain agents and stay eligible: wise! Widening latitude for undrafted players to return to school: yes! Pumping in more money so players can complete degrees: fab! Attempting to tame the global shoe/apparel companies that sink zillions into the sport: Uh…good luck! But sure, worth a try.\nIt’s not a radical set of diktats—it’s not diktats at all, just suggestions that the NCAA has the option to act upon—but let’s acknowledge what it is: mild progress.\nNow let me start whining.\nMore by Jason Gay\nTrying to Love the NFL Draft April 22, 2018 B ! Frozen Baseball Should Cut Games April 19, 2018 Doc Emrick: Hockey’s Beloved Soundtrack April 15, 2018 Uh-Oh. The Yankees and Red Sox Hate Each Other Again April 12, 2018 Tragedy and a Team April 9, 2018 First, it’s a letdown that the commission mostly tinkered under the hood, instead of making an aggressive, foundation-rattling recommendation. It didn’t suggest, as some hoped, that college basketball adopt the Olympic model and let players benefit from their names and images. There’s growing sentiment that the NCAA should do as the Olympics did, and offer college athletes—all of them, in every sport, not just men’s basketball players—the opportunity to accept endorsements and capitalize on their image.\nThat move didn’t ruin the Olympics, and it won’t ruin college sports.\nRice does seem OK with the idea—she pinned the hold-up on current litigation.\nRelated\nPanel Doesn’t Tackle Athlete Compensation Issue Panel to NCAA: Increase Penalties for Rule-Breakers, End One-and-Done “It is hard for the public, and frankly, for me, to understand what can be allowed within the college model,” the former Secretary of State said in her remarks at NCAA HQ in Indianapolis. “For the life of me, I don’t understand the difference between Olympic payments and ‘Dancing with the Stars.’”\nRice was referencing the NCAA’s recent decision to allow the Notre Dame women’s basketball star Arike Ogunbowale to compete on “Dancing with the Stars,” the NCAA concluding that her dancing is unrelated to her basketball skills. This appears to be a shift from the NCAA’s traditional policy of having a complete cow over even the vaguest whiff of athlete entrepreneurialism, like when it made a college football kicker choose between the sport and making money off YouTube videos last year. (He chose YouTube.)\n“Personally, I hope that there will be more room in the college model today for this kind of benefit to students without endangering the college model itself,” Rice said. “And let me just say I hope that Arike wins.”\nThe NCAA has allowed Notre Dame's Arike Ogunbowale to compete on “Dancing With the Stars.” Photo: Tony Dejak/Associated Press Rice and the commission are offering some common sense fixes. My gripes are more holistic. Change is being offered here—but it isn’t drilling to the core of the problem, which is…the NCAA itself.\nOnce again, the NCAA is being portrayed as an agency under siege by unsavory outside forces—crooked agents, skeezy basketball camps, giant multinational shoe companies. Once again, a college education is being presented as adequate compensation in a multibillion-dollar economy in which literally every involved party (the NCAA, the schools, the conferences, the coaches, the networks, agent, the sponsors) are allowed to monetarily benefit, except for one (the players.)\nThis imbalance—and its inherent lack of fairness—is what drives the mess. It isn’t rogue agents or wayward shoe peddlers, but the NCAA’s insistence on amateurism that pushes money underground and creates a Wild West that for some reason the FBI thinks it should be patrolling.\nSports economists have been shouting it for ages: the corruption in high-revenue sports like college basketball and football isn’t a “scandal.” It is what happens when you shut down a valve of a market economy.\nThat is what the details of these federal cases have really shown: College athletes have financial value beyond scholarship offers, and if the money can’t get there legitimately, it will get there another way.\nA general view of the opening tip-off of an NCAA tournament game. Photo: adam hagy/Reuters Which is why it’s hard to see Wednesday’s proposal as the necessary shake-up. Pristine new summer camps, stern words for the opaque sneaker lords…it sounds good, but doesn’t address the existential problem. Neither do the harsh penalties that Rice proposed—five year postseason bans, lifetime bans for crooked coaches, etc. Again, it’s a nice line in a presentation, but there’s a long track record of study that severity of punishment isn’t a terribly effective deterrent.\nYou know what works? Confronting reality. And fairness.\nIt would be great if someone could get the NCAA to stop pushing an antiquated rendering of itself, and to accept the beast that it’s actually become. It would be nice to have a conversation about athlete compensation that doesn’t devolve into some sort of “Reefer Madness”-style paranoia about the end of collegiate athletics. Big money is here to stay in college sports—and to borrow a line from another movie, this is the business the NCAA has chosen. It’s time to treat it like one.\nWrite to Jason Gay at Jason.Gay@wsj.com",
