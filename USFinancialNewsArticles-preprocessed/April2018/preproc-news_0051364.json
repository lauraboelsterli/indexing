REUTERS/Saumya Khandelwal/File Photo\nMuch of Microsoft’s recent growth has been fueled by its cloud computing business as more enterprises seek to cut data storage costs by adopting cloud-based software and moving their applications to data centers.\nThe company’s flagship cloud product Azure, which competes with Amazon.com Inc’s ( AMZN.O ) dominant cloud infrastructure offering Amazon Web Services (AWS), recorded revenue growth of 93 percent in the three months ended March 31.\nAzure’s growth has propelled Microsoft to the No. 2 position in the $15.6 billion cloud computing market with a 14 percent share, behind AWS, which holds a 32 percent slice of the market, research firm Canalys estimated in February.\nRevenue at Microsoft’s productivity and business processes unit, which includes Office 365, rose 17 percent to $9 billion, topping analysts’ average expectation of $8.73 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nOverall, the Redmond, Washington-based software giant’s revenue rose 16 percent to $26.82 billion, ahead of expectations of $25.77 billion.\nMicrosoft said here net income rose to $7.42 billion or 95 cents per share in the third quarter ended March 31, from $5.49 billion or 70 cents per share, a year earlier.\nAnalysts had expected earnings of 85 cents per share.\nMicrosoft’s shares fell about 1 percent in after-hours trading on Thursday.
