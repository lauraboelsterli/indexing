    "text": "April 30, 2018 / 6:54 PM / in a few seconds Brazil's President Temer cancels Asia trip ahead of legislative vote Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nBRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Michel Temer’s press office said on Monday he had canceled a planned visit to four Asian countries because of an important legislative vote this week. FILE PHOTO: Brazil's President Michel Temer looks on during an Army Day ceremony, in Brasilia, Brazil April 19, 2018. REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino\nTemer had been expected to visit Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam May 7-14.\nThe office said he would remain in Brazil to push for the passage of a bill that would free funds for the federal government to pay off debt that Venezuela and Mozambique owe to Brazil’s state development bank BNDES [BNDES.UL] and Credit Suisse.\nBrazil, during the administration of former president Dilma Rousseff, had said it would act as a guarantor for the loans, which financed works carried out by Brazilian firms in Venezuela and Mozambique.\nVenezuela owes the vast majority of the nearly 1 billion reais ($286 million) owed to the banks, which must be paid by May 8.
