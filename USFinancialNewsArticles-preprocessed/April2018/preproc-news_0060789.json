FILE PHOTO: European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas attends a press conference at the European Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium December 8, 2017. REUTERS/Yves Herman\nThe European Union, along with other countries such as Canada and Mexico, were granted temporary exemptions from the tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminium applied from March. Those exemptions expire on May 1.\n“The only thing that I can tell you today is that we are patient but we are also prepared,” Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas told a news conference.
