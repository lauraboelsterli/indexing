    "text": "8 COMMENTS F.H. Buckley’s proposal for wholesale regulatory reform is sensible and long overdue, except for his call to replace detailed rules with common-sense standards (“ The ‘Swamp’ Needs a Justinian ,” op-ed, April 20). As Justice Neil Gorsuch emphasized recently, the law can demand compliance only with laws that provide enough detail to give the person fair notice of what is on what side of the line; those laws must be enforced as written, not as one wishes they had been written or as someone in Congress thought they were written when the yeas and nays were cast. In the rare cases where standards rather than detailed rules apply, the relevant standards—like “reasonable person” in many contexts or “materiality” in securities law or the various levels of “negligence”—work fairly only because they have decades or centuries of baggage that inform their meaning to which affected persons can turn. I would not want to live under a regime where the amount of tax that I owe is the amount that the IRS says is my “fair share.”\nRobert Kantowitz\nLawrence, N.Y.\nPhoto: Istock/Getty Images Since 2010 over 1,000 regulations have been added to the Social Security Disability program adjudication process. Most appalling is the elimination in 2016 of the treating physician rule which required the Social Security Administration and its 1,600 law judges to give controlling weight to the opinion of a claimant’s treating doctor, if that opinion was found to be backed by substantial evidence.\nI worked for 20 years as an attorney and disability advocate in this field. The effect of tedious new rules of evidence, the aforementioned abolition of the treating physician rule, the disregard for the credibility of the hardworking wage-earners who pay for this program, their doctors and the opinions of other government agencies (such as Veterans Affairs) is astounding.\nJacques M. Farhi\nBronx, N.Y.\nProf. Buckley is rightly frustrated, as are many of us, by the arcane process currently required to undo a federal regulation. I am not convinced, however, that adding another layer of bureaucracy is the solution. Why not simply amend the Administrative Procedure Act to allow the executive department to repeal regulations with the proverbial “stroke of a pen”? If Congress disapproves of such an action, it can overrule it by statute. (If Congress can’t muster the requisite majority, what does that say about the recently rescinded regulation?)\nIt might be difficult to get the above proposal through Congress, but no more so than Prof. Buckley’s.\nGeoffrey C. Price\nAustin, Texas",
