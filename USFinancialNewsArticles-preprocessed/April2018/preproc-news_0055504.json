    "text": "LAKE MARY, Fla., April 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- FARO ® (NASDAQ: FARO), the world's most trusted source for 3D measurement and imaging solutions for 3D factory, construction BIM, product design, and public safety forensics, today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Highlights from the quarter included:\nQuarterly sales of $92.8 million, up 13.8% year-over-year Construction BIM segment quarterly sales of $22.7 million, up 19.8% year-over-year Increased gross margin year-over-year to 57.9% for the quarter Decreased G&A expense to 11.9% of sales, down 1.2 percentage points year-over-year\n\"Our first quarter performance provides another quarter that validates our vertical market strategy and growth initiatives with our third consecutive quarter of double digit sales growth and gross margin increase year-over-year,\" stated Dr. Simon Raab, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We continued our innovation in the construction BIM market by releasing FARO BuildIT Construction software to leverage laser scanner technology to eliminate waste and enhance quality control in construction projects. Our emerging verticals of product design and public safety forensics combined to deliver strong year-over-year sales growth, demonstrating the high growth potential in these markets and the returns associated with our sales headcount investments. Quarterly earnings were affected by our intentional acceleration of R&D activities for the fast-growing BIM and 3D machine vision markets. In the quarter, we kicked off our global lean continuous improvement initiative named FARO Best! to further drive efficiencies and improvement in operating margin. With these initiatives and continued investment in R&D, both organically and through the acquisition of strong talent and technologies, we continue to provide more value to our customers and shareholders.\"\nTotal sales increased by $11.2 million, or 13.8%, to $92.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from $81.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Our sales increase was primarily driven by a strong increase in product unit sales in our construction BIM segment, higher average selling prices in our 3D factory segment, and continued service revenue growth. New order bookings increased by $9.2 million, or 10.6%, to $96.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from $86.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nGross margin for the quarter was 57.9%, up 4.3 percentage points compared with 53.6% in the same prior year period, reflecting a strong increase in our product gross margin, mostly due to higher average selling prices especially in our 3D factory segment and improved manufacturing efficiencies with our volume increases in the construction BIM and public safety forensics verticals.\nOperating income was $0.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, reflecting an increase of $2.7 million compared with an operating loss of $2.0 million in the first quarter last year. This increase was primarily driven by the execution of our strategic initiatives to deliver double digit sales growth and a strong increase in gross margin by developing next-generation, market-leading products and expanding our sales headcount across our vertical markets.\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.5 million or $0.03 per share, compared with a net loss of $1.5 million or $0.09 per share in the first quarter last year.\nAs of March 31, 2018, cash and short-term investments totaled $149.8 million, of which $93.9 million was held by foreign subsidiaries.\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are subject to risks and uncertainties, such as statements about demand for and customer acceptance of FARO's products, FARO's product development and product launches, FARO's growth, strategic and continuous improvement initiatives and FARO's growth potential.
