    "text": "LIMA, Peru, April 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Minera IRL Limited (\"Minera IRL\" or the \"Company\"), (BVL:MIRL) (CSE:MIRL), the Latin America gold mining company, is pleased to announce highlights from its annual report for the year ended 31 December 2017, which has been filed on SEDAR.\n2017 Highlights:\nFinancial\nGold sales of 24,536 ounces (2016: 23,343 ounces) at an average realized gold price of $1,253 per ounce (2016: $1,249).

Ore mined and staked of 3,109,206 tonnes (2016: 3,040,331 tonnes). Waste of 2,213,433 tonnes (2016: 1,430,311 tonnes). Total cash costs were $849 per ounce produced (2016: $806). Total all-in sustaining costs (AISC) were $1,106 per ounce produced (2016: $1,074)\nOllachea, Peru\nAfter Corporación Financiera de Desarrollo S.A. (“COFIDE”) revoked its mandate to finance the Ollachea Project in March 2017, the Company began to look for an alternate source for project financing while.\nHighlights include:\nIn February 2018 the Company filed a claim for damages (Memorial de Demanda) in the arbitration proceeding against COFIDE before the Arbitration Tribunal in Lima, Peru. The Company continues to engage in ongoing discussions with potential investors in an effort to refinance the COFIDE Bridge Loan and advance the Ollachea project. The Company remains open to discussions with COFIDE. The Company has continued to engage with the Ollachea community and has maintained an excellent relationship.\nCommenting on the annual results, Gerardo Perez, Minera IRL Limited's Chairman, said, “ D uring the first year of my tenure as Chairman I have witnessed several positive developments which have confirmed my faith in our Group of companies. Over the last year, our common shares resumed trading in Peru and Canada and, at our last Annual General Meeting held in December 2017, our shareholders demonstrated their faith in management by re-electing the entire Board of Directors.\nLast year was also a year for focusing on protecting our assets, after COFIDE revoked its mandate to finance our Ollachea Project. We filed an arbitration action against COFIDE and obtained a court order suspending COFIDE’s legal efforts to collect any debt or to execute guarantees related to repayment of the Bridge Loan until the arbitration process is finalized. The Arbitral Tribunal has ratified the court order. At the same time, we have begun to actively pursue alternatives to finance development of the Ollachea Project with banks and investment funds.\nGold production at Corihuarmi increased by 5% over 2016, reaching 24,709 gold ounces, and we reported a gross profit of $7.6 million and a net profit after taxes of US$ 0.8 million. Gold price at the date of this report was above US$ 1,330 which compared to the price $1,297 and $1,159 per ounce of gold at the end of 2016 and 2015 respectively shows a moderate upward trend.“\nThis press release should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited annual Report and Accounts for the Year Ended 31 December 2017, together with its Annual Information Form and Management's Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&A\") for the year ended 31 December 2017, all of which are available from the Company's website ( www.minera-irl.com ) and on SEDAR ( www.sedar.com ).\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT:\nMinera ​​ IRL ​​ Limited Gerardo Pérez +51 1 418 - 1230 Chairman Diego Benavides +51 1 418 - 1230 Director and CEO Carlos Ruiz de Castilla +1 778 387 5434 Chief Financial Officer Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Information\nNo stock exchange, securities commission or other regulatory authority has approved or disapproved the information contained in this news release.\nCertain information in this news release, including information about the Company’s financial or operating performance, information about the legislative regime to which the Company is subject, and other statements expressing management’s expectations or estimates of future events, performance and exploration and development programs or plans constitute “forward-looking statements”.
