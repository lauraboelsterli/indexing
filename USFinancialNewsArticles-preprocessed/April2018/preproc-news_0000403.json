    "text": "Year over Year Revenue Increase of 83% with Reduction in Net Loss of 53% in 2017 and Fiscal Year 2018 Net Revenue Annual Run Rate of At Least $18 million\nSAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Innovus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (“Innovus Pharma”) (OTCQB: INNV), today announced full year 2017 net revenue of $8.8 million compared to $4.8 million in revenue for the same period in 2016 and fourth quarter of 2017 net revenue of $2.4 million compared to $1.7 million in revenue for the same period in 2016.\nPreliminary first quarter 2018 net revenue is estimated to be between $4.3 million to $4.4 million or an approximate 85% increase from the fourth quarter of 2017. Innovus Pharma's first quarter 2018 anticipated revenue results are preliminary and based on the most current information available and are subject to completion of the consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of 2018.\n“We have seen tremendous growth in our product pipeline and overall net revenue during 2017 and the growth story continues into 2018 with our record first quarter net revenue of an estimated $4.3 million to $4.4 million. We believe our revenue growth into 2018 highlights the continued strength of our ability to sell multiple products through our Beyond Human ® sales and marketing platform and other sales channels,” stated Bassam Damaj, President and Chief Executive Officer of Innovus Pharma. “As we look forward to exiting 2018 as a profitable Company when excluding non-cash expenses, we continue to be focused on increasing annual revenue to at least $18 million by executing on our goals of expanding our product lines and making our products commercially available in the United States and outside of the United States through our partners and new sales channels, as well as achieving profitability.”\nFinancial highlights for the year ended December 31, 2017 included:\nNet revenue totaled $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to net revenue of $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 representing an increase of 83.0%. Net revenue during 2017 was impacted by the natural disasters in Florida, Texas as well as major holidays as the Company was unable to advertise its products for a period of time in those regions and periods as a result. These two states generate close to 15% of our total net revenue and have a population of approximately 17 million in our targeted product demographics*. Gross margins increased to 79.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 77.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Total operating expense increased to $13.9 million and included $1.1 million in non-cash share-based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net loss totaled $6.5 million, or $0.04 per common share, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to a net loss of $13.7 million, or $0.15 per common share, for the year ended December 31, 2016 representing a decrease of 52.5%. The net loss in 2017 included interest expense of $0.9 million, of which $0.8 million was non-cash and related to amortization of debt discounts. The net loss also included a non-cash expense of $0.7 million for the loss on debt extinguishment. Cash balance totaled $1.6 million at December 31, 2017 and current total cash on hand is $4.7 million.\nFinancial highlights for the three months ended December 31, 2017 included:\nNet revenues totaled $2.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to net revenues of $1.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016 representing a 40.7% increase. Sequential quarter over quarter revenue increase of 7.1% 2017 compared to a decrease of 10.1% 2016. Gross margins remained consistent at 78.2% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

The net loss in 2017 included a non-cash expense of $0.3 million for the loss on debt extinguishment. The net loss also included interest expense of $0.1 million which was non-cash and related to amortization of debt discounts.\nFourth quarter 2017 and recent developments:\nReceived our first commercial batch of 220,000 units of FlutiCare® in October 2017 and launched FlutiCare® in the U.S. in November 2017; Moved corporate and company operations into a new 17,000 square-foot facility in San Diego, CA in November 2017 that brought in-house the Company’s product fulfillment and inventory storage process.
