    "text": "Machine Learning at Scale Remains Elusive for Many Firms Few have a solid understanding of the technology; many processes still to be digitized By 7 COMMENTS Panelists speak at the MIT Digital Economy Conference in New York City, April 27, 2018.

Few firms have a solid understanding of how machine learning works and where it can be applied, and tend to focus on small-scale changes rather than creative applications that could generate new revenue or products.\n“With very few exceptions, every company we work with wants to start with a cost-savings application of automation,” said Ms. Mason, who founded machine learning and data science advisory company Fast Forward Labs, now part of Cloudera. Companies don’t like to examine more creative use cases until they’ve completed more risk-averse use cases.\nMachine learning can create value by improving existing processes. Small enhancements to forecasting, for example, can generate big improvements to the bottom line. In addition, artificial intelligence is moving deeper into some business processes , and many companies are turning to software robots , powered by machine learning, to automate mundane tasks and help employees work more efficiently.\nStill, few companies have deployed these technologies in a core business process or at scale, said panelist Michael Chui, a partner at McKinsey Global Institute. “We’re very early.”\nTo reap the true benefits of machine learning, firms first must digitize their business processes to get the data they need to power advanced algorithms, he said. That includes not only having the correct systems in place, but also changing employee behavior as they learn to work with new technologies.\n“If a company just mechanically says OK, I’ll automate this little activity here and this little activity there, rather than re-thinking the entire process and how it can be enabled by technology, they usually get very little value out of it,” Mr. Chui said. “It’s the harder thing to do — rethinking the entire process and how you can use technology — but that’s where the real potential comes from.”\nWrite to ",
