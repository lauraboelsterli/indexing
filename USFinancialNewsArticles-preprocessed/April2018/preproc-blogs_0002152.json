This time around, however, the caravan caught the attention of U.S. President \nDonald Trump, \nTwitter \nto blast it shortly after a news story aired on Fox News. \n“Mexico is doing very little, if not NOTHING, at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through their Southern Border, and then into the U.S. They laugh at our dumb immigration laws. They must stop the big drug and people flows, or I will stop their cash cow, NAFTA. NEED WALL!” \nOn Monday, Mr. Trump cited the “caravan” on Twitter again, saying the U.S. immigration system was out of control and urging Congress to pass tougher immigration and border laws. \nMr. Trump blamed Democrats for failing to pass legislation protecting young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, while also declaring his own opposition to such a deal. Mr. Trump announced an end to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program last fall. \n“Getting more dangerous. ‘Caravans’ coming,” the president wrote in one tweet. “Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW. NO MORE DACA DEAL.” \nMexican Foreign Minister \nLuis Videgaray \nresponded to Mr. Trump’s comment Sunday with a tweet of his own denying that his government was doing nothing to control migration. \n“Every day Mexico and the U.S. work together on migration throughout the region. Facts clearly reflect this,” he said. “….Upholding human dignity and rights is not at odds with the rule of law.” \nOn Monday \nKirstjen Nielsen, \nthe secretary of homeland security, tweeted: “Working with Mexican officials to address the yearly illegal alien caravan. Exploring all options.” \nMost of the migrants in the march are Hondurans fleeing crime and political persecution at home, said \nJosael Romero, \na Salvadoran activist who runs a migrant shelter in the Mexican state of Sonora and is traveling with the march. \nMr. Romero said he represented Pueblo sin Fronteras (People Without Frontiers), the advocacy group that organizes the march, and was traveling with his fourth caravan since moving to Mexico five years ago. He said the group has mounted dozens of treks through Mexico over the last 15 years, and wasn’t encountering problems this year from immigration officials or police. \nThe majority of migrants in past groups have succeeded in entering the U.S. and petitioning the government for asylum, Mr. Romero said, adding that many of those applications were still being processed. \n“They want to stop us, but we will keep on fighting,” he said. “We’ve been moving along peacefully, and we haven’t lost faith.” \nThe march comes as Mexican authorities have stepped up apprehensions and deportations of undocumented migrants across the country. Mexico deported 15,835 Central Americans in the first two months of this year, up from 14,797 in the same period a year earlier, according to government statistics. The vast majority were from Guatemala and Honduras. \nIn all of last year, Mexican immigration authorities deported 95,497 foreigners for lack of proper documents, 81,999 of them Central Americans. In fiscal 2017, the U.S. deported 75,923 Central Americans and 128,765 Mexicans. \nNearly 40,000 Central Americans from the troubled countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador sought asylum in the U.S. in 2016, nine times as many as in 2010, according to the most recent data available from the Department of Justice. Among those, Hondurans seeking asylum rose from 783 to 10,818 over the same period. In a typical year, fewer than 10% of applicants will be granted asylum status. \nMexican authorities haven’t stopped the annual protest march because many of the migrants involved have started the process of seeking asylum or humanitarian visas in Mexico, so they aren’t in the country illegally, a senior Mexican immigration official said on Monday. \n“This isn’t a massive influx of irregular migrants,” the official added. “They can remain in the country and move around while their immigration situation is worked out.” \nThis year’s group is slowly moving north along highways from southern Mexico to Baja California. Organizers say it will try to enter the U.S. at border crossings in Mexicali or Tijuana. The caravan has been setting up camp at night on sports fields and accepting food, medicine and water from supporters along the way. \n“We aren’t criminals, we are international workers,” caravan organizers shouted over the weekend, using microphones as the migrants marched toward Tapachula, in Mexico’s southern state of Chiapas from the nearby border with Guatemala. \nThe marchers have generated controversy in Mexico, too. Other organizations that work with migrants criticized the action for risking the lives and welfare of the marchers. \nAlberto Xicotencatl, \nthe director of a migrant shelter in the Mexican city of Saltillo, said while he can’t condemn the caravans because their demands to protect migrants are legitimate, “we also realized that this type of mobilization often affects public opinion and policy in a negative way.” \n“We don’t think this sort of thing strengthens the movement to respect the human rights of migrants in Mexico,” he added. “You need a lot more than a caravan to do that.” —Juan Montes and Laura Meckler contributed to this article. \nWrite to José de Córdoba at [email protected] and Robbie Whelan at [email protected] ADVERTISEMENT",
