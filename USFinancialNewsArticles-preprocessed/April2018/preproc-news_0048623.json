    "text": "The ex-wife of Steve Wynn , who is also the biggest shareholder and co-founder of Wynn Resorts , is seeking to remove one of the company directors overseeing an internal investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against the casino magnate.\nElaine Wynn said in a filing Monday with U.S. regulators that John Hagenbuch is allied too closely with Steve Wynn. She asked shareholders to reject his re-election.\nSteve Wynn resigned as chairman and CEO and later sold his company shares after the Wall Street Journal reported that several women said he harassed or assaulted them and that one case led to a $7.5 million settlement. He denies the allegations. He has filed a defamation lawsuit against The Associated Press for its reporting on a separate allegation made to police.",
