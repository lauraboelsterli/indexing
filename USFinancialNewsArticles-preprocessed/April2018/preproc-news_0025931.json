    "text": "HSINCHU, Taiwan, SemiLEDs Corporation (NASDAQ:LEDS), “SemiLEDs” or the “Company,” a developer and manufacturer of LED chips and LED components, today announced its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, ended February 28, 2018.\nRevenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $1.5 million, a 23% decrease compared to $2.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. GAAP net loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $1.1 million, compared to a loss of $0.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, or a net loss of $0.32 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $0.11 per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. In the second quarter, we shut down our manufacturing production for two weeks due to the Chinese New Year holiday. During the second quarter ended February 28, 2018, we moved and consolidated our LED packaging facility in HsinAn to our headquarters in Chunan, Taiwan as part of our cost reduction efforts.\nGAAP gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was negative 29%, compared with gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 of 3%. Operating margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was negative 80%, compared with negative 43% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents was $3.9 million at February 28, 2018, compared to $3.4 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018.\nWe expect revenue for the third quarter ending May 31, 2018 to be about $1.8 million +/- 10%.\nAbout SemiLEDs\nSemiLEDs develops and manufactures LED chips and LED components for general lighting applications, including street lights and commercial, industrial, system and residential lighting, along with specialty industrial applications such as ultraviolet (UV) curing, medical/cosmetic, counterfeit detection, horticulture, architectural lighting and entertainment lighting.
