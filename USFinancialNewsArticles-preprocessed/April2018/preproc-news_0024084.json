Coeure suggested previously that the role of rates guidance could be strengthened but did not give specifics.\nContinuing concern over a prolonged trade dispute between the United States and China are also keeping markets on edge.\nChina’s Commerce Ministry said on Thursday that trade negotiations with the United States would be impossible because Washington’s attempts at dialogue were not sincere and vowed to retaliate should Trump escalate current tensions.\nECB chief Mario Draghi said on Wednesday that the direct effect on the euro zone economy of trade tariffs announced by the United States and China is small but they can hurt investor confidence and trigger retaliation.\nElsewhere, Italy sold 9.17 billion in bonds maturing in 2021, 2025, 2038 and 2048.\nItalian debt has outperformed its peers, with the premium investors demand to hold Italian 10-year bonds over top-rated German debt currently at 131 basis points, close to its tightest level since 2016.\nItalian President Sergio Mattarella is scheduled to hold further talks on Thursday and Friday to try stitch together a new government after an inconclusive March 4 election.
