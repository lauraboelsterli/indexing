    "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China opposes the use of a countryâ€™s domestic laws to control others, a foreign ministry spokeswoman said on Thursday, when asked if Chinese tech company Huawei had violated U.S. sanctions related to Iran.\nThe Huawei logo is seen at a forum in Shenyang, Liaoning province, China April 25, 2018. Picture taken April 25, 2018. REUTERS/Stringer Hua Chunying made the comment at a daily briefing, while also urging the United States not to do anything else that harmed the openness of international trade.\nU.S. prosecutors in New York have been investigating whether Huawei violated U.S. sanctions in relation to Iran, according to sources familiar with the situation.\nReporting by Christian Shepherd; Writing by Philip Wen; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\n ",
