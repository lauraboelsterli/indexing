On a per share basis, net income increased 26.5% to $0.33 per share versus $0.26 per share. Additionally, the Company reported first quarter return on average tangible common equity (ROATCE) of 17.31% compared to 15.33% for the first quarter of 2017, a 12.9% increase.\nRichard M. Sanborn, President & Chief Executive Officer, commented, “The first quarter of 2018 was our first full quarter operating with the Capital Bank acquisition fully integrated and we are very pleased with the results. We completed the acquisition on October 1, 2017, and completed the systems integration on October 28, 2017. Since then the teams have worked very hard to ensure both the Seacoast and Capital clients have the best-in-class products and services so their businesses can grow and prosper, and the results show it's working. Since the close of our acquisition six months ago, we have seen no loan balance reductions, far less than the 15% run-off typically experienced in acquisitions. This speaks volumes to the high acceptance rate of our products and services by the Capital Bank clientele, and the amazing service our employees provide to our new client base.”\nAllan W. Arendsee, Chairman of the Board, stated, “The board of directors is very pleased with how the Capital Bank acquisition, and the bank in total, is performing, especially from a financial and risk management perspective. It’s gratifying to see the results from an acquisition come in ahead of plan and it is a testament to the effectiveness of the management team’s due diligence before the deal was announced, and to the entire staff’s dedication to close the transaction, integrate the systems, and maintain client relationships in a way that preserves the value that was acquired. As always, the board of directors believes that the right plan is in place to continue providing shareholders with an exceptional return on their investment over the long-term.”\nQuarterly Financial highlights (in millions):\n03/31/2018 12/31/2017 03/31/2017 03/31 Change % Change Consolidated Net Income $3.053 ($2.142) $1.584 $1.470 92.8% ROATCE 17.31% (11.68%) 15.33% 1.97% 12.9% ROAA 1.30% (0.91%) 1.09% 0.21% 19.5% Earnings Per Share (Basic) $0.33 ($0.23) $0.26 $0.07 26.5% Net Interest Margin YTD 5.59% 5.34% 4.72% $0.87 18.4% Bank Efficiency Ratio 67.5% 74.7% 74.1% (6.6%) (8.7%) SBA Division’s quarter-to-date results (in millions):\n03/31/2018 12/31/2017 03/31/2017 Change % Change SBA Loan Production $47.580 $69.627 $52.045 ($4.465) (8.6%) SBA 7(a) guaranteed Loan Sales $13.925 $18.151 $16.644 ($2.719) (16.3%) Percent of Guaranteed Loan Sales 39.0% 34.8% 42.6% (3.6%) (8.5%) SBA Guaranteed Loan Inventory $372.487 $359.436 $301.970 $70.517 23.4% As previously discussed, the Company’s growth and long-term shareholder value creation strategy is based on consistently generating and holding more saleable SBA loans.
