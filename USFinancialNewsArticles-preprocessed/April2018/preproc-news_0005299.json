(NASDAQ: RECN), a multinational business consulting firm, operating as Resources Global Professionals (the “Company” or “RGP”), today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended February 24, 2018.\nRevenue for the third quarter of 2018 was $172.4 million, up approximately 20% year over year and 10% sequentially, including revenue from the Company’s recent Accretive Solutions, Inc. (“Accretive”) and taskforce – Management on Demand AG (“taskforce”) acquisitions. Excluding Accretive and taskforce, revenue was up approximately 5% year over year. Revenue in Europe improved for the ninth successive quarter, up 61% year over year, including revenue from taskforce. Revenue in the US increased approximately 15% year over year, including revenue from Accretive. The Company’s Asia Pacific revenue improved 9.4% year over year.\nNet income for the quarter was $4.6 million (2.7% of revenue), with an Adjusted EBITDA* of $8.7 million (5.0% of revenue). Net income per diluted share was $0.14 for the third quarter of 2018, including $0.07 per diluted share related to a reduction in income tax expense from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, offset by costs of $0.11 per diluted share related to severance, acquisition, business development, transformation and integration expenses during the quarter. The Company paid a quarterly cash dividend on December 14, 2017 of $0.12 per share, resulting in a total dividend payment of $3.6 million. RGP also repurchased approximately $5.1 million of its common stock on the open market; as of February 24, 2018, approximately $120 million remains available for future repurchases of the Company’s common stock under the Company’s share repurchase program.\n“We achieved strong results this quarter across our three priority focus areas: growing revenue in all geographies, the smooth integration of Accretive and taskforce, and continuing the successful execution of our strategic initiatives,” said Kate Duchene, President and Chief Executive Officer of RGP. “Our performance demonstrates the positive impact that our acquisitions and strategic initiatives are beginning to have on the business. We remain focused on delivering in all three areas in Q4 to build on our momentum and capitalize on the many growth opportunities ahead.”\n*Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation.\nUPDATE ON ACQUISITION INTEGRATIONS\nRGP has made continued progress this quarter in integrating its two acquisitions, Accretive and taskforce, and the Company remains on track to complete the integration of both acquisitions during the summer. RGP’s consolidated financial results for the third quarter include Accretive revenue of approximately $17.3 million and taskforce revenue of approximately $3.8 million.\nUPDATE ON STRATEGIC INITIATIVES\nRGP continues to implement successfully the strategic initiatives it announced last year to improve its performance in both revenue generation and cost containment. With respect to the first initiative, to transform the Company’s sales culture, RGP has completed virtually all of its sales transformation efforts in the US. The Company has rolled out Salesforce throughout the enterprise, launched a new learning and development program and developed go to market, sales management and account development playbooks to guide sales behavior. A new incentive structure for the Company’s sales team is expected to be fully developed by the end of the fourth quarter and implemented in fiscal year 2019. Revenue for the Company’s Strategic Client Program (“SCP”) is up 9.0% year over year, and SCP is expected to deliver additional growth in fiscal year 2019.\nThe Company’s second initiative, to redesign its business model to enhance client offerings, is substantially complete. In the third quarter, RGP finished building out its talent group, marking the completion of all of its major structural updates. The Company also completed the implementation of a sales structure in all major markets to focus on middle market client acquisition and development. The Company is now operating entirely under its new organizational design in the US, and is focused on driving accountability, productivity and results. As part of these efforts, the Company recently hosted a leadership summit in Dallas to outline the management team’s strategies and business objectives and more clearly define roles and responsibilities.\nThe Company remains committed to its third initiative, to contain costs and lower selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) as a percentage of revenue. The Company’s SG&A was higher than planned this quarter, largely due to costs associated with the integration of the Company’s two acquisitions and increased business development and training efforts. These short-term costs are a necessary investment in the growth of the business and its client base, and are expected to taper off beginning in fiscal year 2019, and to be further offset by additional cost synergies realized through the successful integrations of the Accretive and taskforce acquisitions.\nFISCAL THIRD QUARTER REVIEW\nRevenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased by 19.9% (17.6% constant currency) to $172.4 million compared to $143.8 million in the prior year third quarter. Without Accretive’s revenue of $17.3 million in the quarter and taskforce’s revenue of $3.8 million revenue was up 5.2%. On a sequential basis, third quarter revenue increased by approximately 10% (9.6% constant currency) from $156.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Absent revenue from the acquisitions, revenue decreased $1.8 million sequentially, or 1.2%. The decline, which was expected, can be attributed primarily to the Christmas, New Year and Chinese New Year holidays, with the only significant holiday in the second quarter being Thanksgiving in the US. Year over year constant currency results for international revenue are computed using the comparable third quarter fiscal 2017 conversion rates, and the sequential quarter constant currency international revenue is computed using the comparable second quarter fiscal 2018 conversion rates.\nIncluding Accretive operations, revenue in the US increased by 14.9% year over year and 12.5% sequentially. Excluding Accretive operations, US revenue was flat year over year and decreased 2.0% sequentially. The sequential decrease was expected and was primarily due to the timing of holidays, as outlined above. International revenue improved by 41.4% year over year (29.6% constant currency) and 2.1% sequentially (0.6% constant currency), reflecting strength in the Company’s United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden practices. Revenue in Europe grew 34.4% year over year and 0.2% sequentially, excluding revenue attributable to the taskforce acquisition.\nNet income improved in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to $4.6 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, including $0.07 per diluted share related to a reduction in income tax expense from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, offset by costs of $0.11 per diluted share related to severance, acquisition, business development and transformation related expenses during the quarter; this compares to net income of $2.9 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, in the prior year third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $8.7 million (5.0% of revenue) and $8.4 million (5.8% of revenue) for the quarter ended February 24, 2018 and February 25, 2017, respectively.\nGross margin of 36.3% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was flat compared to the prior year third quarter. Sequentially, gross margin decreased 160 basis points from 37.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily due to an increase in average pay rate per hour and an increase in employer payroll tax expense typically experienced with the beginning of a new calendar year.\nSG&A expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $55.3 million (32.1% of revenue) compared to $45.4 million (31.5% of revenue) in the prior year third quarter and $47.5 million (30.3% of revenue) in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The Company recorded approximately $3.6 million related to severance, acquisition, transformation and integration costs in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, including approximately $700,000 related to severance expenses. Without these charges, the primary driver of the SG&A increase year over year was additional expenses related to the operations of Accretive and taskforce of $6.2 million. Sequentially, SG&A increased because of $5.2 million of expenses related to the operations of Accretive, an increase of $0.7 million over the amount incurred related to severance, acquisition, transformation and integration costs, an increase in higher employer payroll related taxes with the reset of limit rates at the beginning of the new calendar year and an increase in the provision for uncollectable accounts.\nCash used in operations was $3.9 million for the third quarter ended February 24, 2018, compared to $1.2 million for the third quarter ended February 25, 2017; the increased use of cash was primarily driven by growth in the Company’s revenue activity at the end of the quarter, increasing the ending fiscal 2018 third quarter balance of accounts receivable.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company paid a dividend of $0.12 per share to shareholders, resulting in a total dividend payment of $3.6 million. RGP also purchased 320,822 shares of its common stock on the open market at an average price of $15.95 per share, for approximately $5.1 million. As of February 24, 2018, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents were $43.2 million compared to $56.3 million at the end of the second quarter on November 25, 2017.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nRGP will hold a conference call for analysts and investors at 5:00 p.m., ET today, April 4, 2018.

The expense for the nine months ended February 24, 2018 includes approximately $140,000 related to accelerated vesting of stock options as part of the agreement with a departing senior executive; the expense for the nine months ended February 25, 2017 includes approximately $400,000, or $0.01 per share, related to accelerated vesting of options as part of the agreement with a departing senior executive.\n(2) The Company’s effective tax rate was approximately 1% and approximately 49% for the three months ended February 24, 2018 and February 25, 2017, respectively and approximately 26% and 44% for the nine months ended February 24, 2018 and February 25, 2017, respectively. On December 22, 2017, US federal tax reform was enacted which lowered the US statutory federal tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a blended US statutory federal tax rate of approximately 29.4% for fiscal year ending May 26, 2018. For the three months ended February 24, 2018, the Company reported provisional amounts related to the impact of US federal tax reform, including a tax benefit of $1.1 million due to re-measurement of US deferred tax assets and liabilities at the rate the balances are expected to be realized (29.4% in fiscal 2018 and 21% thereafter) and a tax benefit of $1.1 million as a result of applying the reduced statutory federal rate of 29.4% to the US earnings for fiscal 2018.\nThe nine months ended February 24, 2018 also includes the reversal of approximately $2.4 million of valuation allowances on the deferred tax assets of certain foreign entities and the nine months ended February 25, 2017 includes the reversal of approximately $0.2 million of tax valuation allowances. For all periods presented, the Company is unable to benefit from, or has limitations on the benefit of, tax losses in certain foreign jurisdictions. To a lesser extent, the accounting treatment under GAAP for the cost associated with incentive stock options and shares purchased through the Employee Stock Purchase Plan has caused volatility in the Company’s effective tax rate.\nRESOURCES CONNECTION, INC.

A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of operations; or (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable measure so calculated and presented.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA is calculated as net income before amortization of intangible assets, depreciation expense, interest and income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by revenue. We believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, which are used by management to assess the core performance of our Company, also provide useful information to our investors because they are alternative financial measures that investors can also use to assess the core performance of our Company and compare it to the Company’s peers. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not measurements of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or construed as substitutes for net income or other cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP for purposes of analyzing our profitability or liquidity. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net income, earnings per share, cash flows or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nRESOURCES CONNECTION, INC.
