    "text": "MARTINSVILLE, Va., April 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hooker Furniture (NASDAQ:HOFT) today reported consolidated net sales of $620.6 million and net income of $28.6 million, or $2.44 per diluted share, for its fifty-two-week fiscal year that ended on January 28, 2018.\nConsolidated net sales increased $43.4 million, or 7.5%, from the prior year. Net income increased $3.3 million, or 12.9%. Earnings per diluted share increased 11.9% from $2.18 in the prior year.\n“We’re pleased with our performance for the fiscal year, with solid sales growth, double-digit gains in profitability and strong cash flow generation,” said Paul B. Toms Jr., chairman and chief executive officer.\nHigher sales in all reportable segments contributed to the annual consolidated revenue increase, driven by a 6% increase in the Home Meridian segment and a 20% sales increase in the All Other Segment. Nearly 80% of the All Other segment net sales increase was due to the inclusion of four months of revenues from the business of Shenandoah Furniture, which was acquired on September 29, 2017.\n“Over the last few years, our strategy has been to leverage the financial strength of our traditional businesses to grow profitably, both organically and through acquisitions,” said Toms. “That strategy has helped us build a more diverse and robust portfolio of brands yielding strong results, as we focus our resources and management around winning distribution channels, products and price-points.”\nFor the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter, consolidated net sales were $175.5 million, with net income of $8.8 million, or $0.75 per diluted share. Net sales increased $1.6 million, or roughly 1%, compared to last year’s fourth quarter, while net income decreased 19.5%, primarily due to the $1.8 million charge recorded to adjust the value of the Company’s deferred tax assets, resulting from the tax rate reduction under the recently-enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nEarnings per diluted share decreased 21% from $0.95 in the prior year fourth quarter. “While income and earnings per share were unfavorably impacted by about $0.15 per share in the fourth quarter due to the federal tax rate adjustment, we anticipate approximately $6 million in additional net income in the 2019 fiscal year from tax reform,” Toms said.\nThe Home Meridian segment’s strong sales results for the year were tempered somewhat by a fourth quarter sales decrease compared to the prior year’s record fourth-quarter shipments. In addition, the All Other Segment experienced some unfavorable impact on margins from raw materials inflation and excess capacity in two domestic-manufacturing divisions in that segment.\nDuring the fiscal year, higher revenues helped boost consolidated operating income by $6.7 million, or 17%. The improvement came despite approximately $800,000 in costs related to the Shenandoah acquisition and amortization of intangibles with shorter economic lives from that acquisition. Also contributing to the higher operating income was $1.8 million less in intangible asset amortization in the Home Meridian segment for the current fiscal year and the absence of $1.2 million in acquisition-related expenses for the Home Meridian acquisition.\nSegment Reporting: Hooker Branded\nHooker Branded segment revenues grew $8.1 million or 5.1% in fiscal 2018, primarily due to dramatic growth at Hooker Upholstery. “The strength of Hooker Upholstery’s recovery, after significant vendor quality issues last year, demonstrates the future potential of that business unit and the value it offers to our customers. After two previous years of flat or modestly-declining sales, our casegoods business stabilized throughout the year, finishing with solid growth in the fourth quarter,” said Toms.\n“The segment continues to trend in the right direction, with sales and incoming orders up approximately 8.6% in the first two months of the current fiscal year versus the similar period in fiscal 2018. Hooker Branded is a significant earnings engine for the company that has allowed us to fund many of our growth initiatives. Our strategy to align our resources around winning and emerging channels of distribution while continuing to support the traditional channels that have been Hooker’s bread and butter over the years is yielding positive results.”\nSegment operating margin remained a solid 13.0% for the fiscal year. For the quarter, the operating margin was 15.3%, reflecting the leverage gained from the uptick in sales.\nSegment Reporting: Home Meridian\n“For the fiscal year, the Home Meridian segment grew its net sales 6%, its operating profit nearly 30%, and met its financial goals” said George Revington, chief operating officer of Hooker Furniture. “For the quarter, net sales were down 8.8% compared to the prior year’s record 4th quarter shipments, and operating income was down 4.8%. For the year, sales in our Accentrics Home eCommerce division were up 57.4% and Samuel Lawrence Furniture, our largest division, was up 12.8%. In the fourth quarter, these increases were offset by a decline in shipments in our hospitality group. The 30% growth in operating income for the year resulted from a favorable reduction in cost of goods, improved expense management, and further leveraging our current infrastructure. Intangible amortization expense was also down in fiscal 2018, due primarily to the short amortization period of some of Home Meridian’s acquisition-related intangible assets in the prior year.”\n“Fourth quarter orders were up 2% and backlog was down 8%. However, as of the end of fiscal 2019 March period, Home Meridian’s current backlog is up 19.3% over prior year and orders fiscal year to date are up 12.2%. While some of these orders are scheduled out over the next several quarters and will not affect our first quarter, this is a positive trend. Our emerging channels of distribution for the year grew at 2.5 times the rate of our traditional channels, led again by our sales to eCommerce customers, which grew 46%,” Revington said\nSegment Reporting: “All Other”\n“The All Other segment increased sales by about 20% on the strength of the addition of Shenandoah’s revenues for the last four months of the year, and to a lesser extent, sales increases at Bradington-Young and H Contract. “Specializing in upscale furnishings for senior living facilities and retirement centers, H Contract contributed over one million dollars to operating income,” Toms said. Toms noted that strong upholstery sales and profitability “were tempered somewhat in the fourth quarter by price increases in raw materials and some excess capacity at Sam Moore and Shenandoah, but we expect those factors to be temporary. Overall, the upholstery businesses performed very well for the year,” he concluded.\nCash, Debt and Inventory\nThe Company finished the fiscal 2018 year with $30.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and $53.4 million in acquisition-related debt. Additionally, $28.5 million was available on its $30.0 million revolving credit facility, net of $1.5 million reserved for standby letters of credit. Consolidated inventories stood at $84.9 million.\n“Because of our strong cash flow, we were able to make an unscheduled, additional payment on our debt of $10 million last week,” Toms said. Also, as a result of cash generated from operations, Hooker increased its dividend nearly 17% per share in December 2017.\nOutlook\n“Both current retail conditions and our business results can be best described as mixed,” said Toms. “Business during the President’s Day promotions at retail was very good for most retailers and for us, but overall activity varies by region of the country, by region of the world and by distribution channel. Our businesses cross various home furnishings product segments, price points and distribution channels, so at any given time we have winners and losers. Currently, our Hooker branded business in the higher price points is faring well, with orders up about 9% compared to this time last year. While Home Meridian’s orders are up 12% over prior year, its hospitality business, their smallest marketing group, remains weak and their suppliers’ post-Chinese New Year’s recovery has been slower than normal. We expect these situations will be temporary. With our diverse portfolio and strategy to focus on winning channels, we are well-positioned to grow sales and income in the coming year, thanks to the solid foundation of our traditional business and our initiatives to create new opportunities,” Toms concluded.\nDividends\nOn March 5, 2018, the Company’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 per share, payable on March 30, 2018 to shareholders of record at March 19, 2018.\nConference Call Details\nHooker Furniture will present its fiscal 2018 fourth quarter results via teleconference and live internet web cast on Thursday afternoon, April 5, 2018, at 2:00 PM Eastern Time.
