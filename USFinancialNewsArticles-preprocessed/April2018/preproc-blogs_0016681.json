    "text": "\nToday: 16.8 \nSource: Thomson Reuters \nNext week, the markets will turn to earnings, and here there is good news and bad news. \nGood news: Early reports are off-the-charts good. A small group of companies — 23 of them, mostly those with quarters that end in February — have already reported. It's a diverse bunch, including Monsanto , McCormick , FedEx and Oracle . S&P 500 earnings: The first reports \n(23 companies) \nEarnings: up 27 percent \nRevenue: up 11.5 percent \n\"These are the best earnings and growth since 2010, the aftermath of the financial crisis,\" Nick Raich, who tracks earnings estimates as The Earnings Scout, told CNBC. \"This is phenomenal growth.\" \nAnd Raich does not believe the numbers will flag. Earnings for the rest of the S&P 500 are at 18.4 percent growth overall, also the highest since 2011. \"I believe the strong upward trend will continue, and I believe first-quarter earnings will end up over 20 percent,\" Raich told me. \nHere's the bad news: Analysts are keeping earnings estimates for the rest of the year in sky-high, record territory, with nearly 20 percent growth in every quarter. \nThat means the risk is to the downside, since expectations are very high. \nCan the guidance really live up to the hype? \nRaich believes it can. \"Estimates for the second, third and fourth quarter have been going higher almost every week this quarter, which we have not seen since 2011. For years, every season we have seen earnings get cut right after they report, but in the past two quarters they have been rising.\" Bob Pisani CNBC \"On-Air Stocks\" Editor Related Securities ",
