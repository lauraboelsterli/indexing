    "text": "Alfie Evans, terminally ill British toddler, dies after UK doctors remove life support Alfie Evans, whose medical case made him a worldwide cause, died early Saturday. Evans had a degenerative condition, and doctors pulled his life support earlier this week. U.K. authorities denied his parents' attempts to transport him abroad to receive experimental treatment. Published 6 Hours Ago The Associated Press Anthony Devlin | Getty Images\nThe parents of a terminally ill British toddler whose case drew attention from Pope Francis and others around the world say they are \"heartbroken\" that their son has died.\nKate James and Tom Evans said on Facebook that 23-month-old Alfie Evans, who had an incurable degenerative brain condition and was at the center of a legal battle over his treatment, died on Saturday morning.\nDoctors treating Alfie said further treatment was futile and he should be allowed to die, but his parents -- backed by the pope and Christian groups -- fought for months to take him to a hospital in Italy so he could be kept on life support.",
