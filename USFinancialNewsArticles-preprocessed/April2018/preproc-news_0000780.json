    "text": "2017 Revenues of $485.7 million; Service Revenues of $94.4 Million\nConference Call Scheduled for 9:00am ET Tuesday April 3, 2018\nPITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Limbach Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:LMB) (“Limbach” or the “Company”) today announced financial results for the quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. Full-year revenues increased 8.7% versus the prior year to $485.7 million in 2017. Service segment revenue of $94.4 million grew 14.8% from the prior year while Construction segment revenues grew 7.3% to $391.4 million.\nOther key financial highlights of the year included:\nGross margin was 13.5%, compared with 12.5% in the prior year. Gross margin improved versus 2016 due largely to the combination of improved project execution and improved overall market pricing, a trend the Company expects to continue in the near-term. Construction revenue growth of 7.3% versus 2016 was positively impacted by strong performances in the Mid-Atlantic, Michigan, and Eastern Pennsylvania branches, offset by declines in the Southern California and New England branches. The Company continues to benefit from the diversity of geographic regions and market sectors, and the lack of any meaningful concentration with any one customer, all of which are a strategic advantage Limbach expects to maintain over the coming years. Limbach experienced strong sector performance from our presence in the healthcare, entertainment, sports and commercial sectors, and with its emerging expansion into the Mission Critical (large data centers) and Industrial sectors. Year over year Service segment revenue growth of 14.8% was led by the Michigan, Florida and Southern California branches. Pre-tax income was $3.9 million for the full-year 2017, compared with a pre-tax loss of $(2.0) million in the prior year. 2017 pre-tax income includes $1.7 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense. 2017 Income Tax expense was $3.2 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 81.6%. This higher rate was due to a one-time charge of $1.7 million from the revaluation of the Company’s Deferred Tax Assets due to the recently-enacted federal tax legislation. Net loss attributable to common stockholders in 2017 was $(0.9) million, compared with net income of $1.4 million in 2016. Construction operations contributed 80.6% of total revenue, while Service operations contributed 19.4%. Aggregate backlog at December 31, 2017 was $461.4 million, of which $34.7 million was Service work. Limbach expects approximately 65% of our aggregate backlog to be recognized as revenue in fiscal 2018. Maintenance Base grew to $12.9 million at December 31, 2017 from $11.3 million a year ago. Sales of maintenance contracts year-on-year increased by a record $3.4 million, or 31%. Combined Construction and Service sales pipeline, a measure of opportunities the Company is tracking, stands at $3.3 billion compared to $2.4 billion at December 31, 2016.\nManagement Commentary\nCharlie Bacon, CEO of Limbach, commented, “We accomplished a tremendous amount in 2017, highlighted by full-year revenues of $485.7 million, which was up 8.7% from the prior year. That exceeded our internal projections for the year and was also in excess of the high end of our initial financial guidance which we shared with the market on April 17, 2017. We recorded revenue growth in both our operating segments, as Construction revenue increased 7.3% to $391.4 million, while Service revenue grew 14.8% to $94.4 million. Within our Service segment, our maintenance base grew to $12.9 million from $11.3 million. We focus on growing the maintenance base because it leads to “Pull-Through Revenue” of approximately four times the value of the maintenance base, so I am certainly pleased to see this growth.\nOur bottom-line results were weighed down by several non-recurring expenses, including those stemming from investments we made to enhance our financial reporting and to meet other public company reporting requirements as we completed our transition to becoming a public company. Adjusted EBITDA for the year was $16.7 million. The Company would have been at the top end of its guidance range if not for these expenses. Finally, the recent passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also triggered a one-time charge of $1.7 million due to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets. Going forward, we look forward to our corporate tax rate moving significantly lower.”\nMr. Bacon continued, “All of our field intelligence suggests that the wind is at our backs in terms of non-residential construction demand in the end-markets in which we focus. Recent reports from industry research firms such as FMI have confirmed that view. We are also very excited about our initial success in the Mission Critical sector, with the award of our first large-scale data center project. We were chosen for this project due to our reputation as a premium specialty contractor. Companies owning and operating the latest generation of data centers demand design, engineering and construction excellence, and we are perfectly-positioned to win significant additional business in this growth sector based on our capabilities in these functional areas. I am very excited about our prospects for 2018 and look forward to reporting on our progress throughout the year.”\nFourth Quarter Highlights\nRevenues\nFourth quarter 2017 revenues of $131.4 million were down 1.7% versus $133.7 million for the prior year period due to the timing of commencement of multiple new Construction projects. As these newly started projects mature further, the Company anticipates a return to year-over-year Construction segment growth. Construction operations accounted for 82.1% of revenues while Service operations provided the remaining 17.9%.\nGross Margin\nGross margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 15.9%, up significantly from 11.3% in the fourth quarter of 2016. On a dollar basis, gross profit in the fourth quarter was $20.9 million, compared with $15.1 million for the prior year period. The year-over-year improvement in fourth quarter 2017 gross profit was driven by improved project mix and generally positive industry pricing trends.\nOperating Income\nThe Company reported operating income of $5.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to an operating loss of $(0.8) million for the prior year period. The increase in operating income was due primarily to improved gross profits while the Company was able to reduce total operating expenses to $15.8 million, which was down slightly from $15.9 million a year ago. Selling, General and Administrative expenses totaled $15.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, versus $14.2 million a year ago. Fourth quarter SG&A includes $0.7 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Amortization of Intangibles expense declined from $1.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 to $0.8 million the same period of 2017. As a percentage of total revenue, fourth quarter 2017 SG&A accounted for 11.5% compared with 10.6% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nTax Expense\nAs a result of the recently-enacted federal tax legislation, the Company was required to take a one-time charge due to the revaluation of its Deferred Tax Assets. The one-time charge of $1.7 million contributed significantly to an overall effective tax rate of 75.6% in the fourth quarter, based on a total tax provision of $3.5 million. The tax rate without the one-time charge was 37.6%. The Company does not expect this expense to recur.\nFull Year Highlights\nRevenues\n2017 revenues of $485.7 million were up 8.7% versus $447.0 million for the prior year, led by Service segment growth of 14.8%. Construction segment revenues also featured solid growth of 7.3% versus the prior year period. Construction operations represented 80.6% of total revenue while Service operations represented the remaining 19.4%.\nGross Margin\nGross margin for the full year 2017 was 13.5% versus 12.5% for the prior year. On a dollar basis, gross profit in the 2017 was $65.6 million, compared with $55.7 million for the prior year period. Construction segment gross margin was 11.4% in the 2017, up from 10.4% in 2016. Service segment gross margin in 2017 increased to 22.1%, versus 21.3% in the year-ago period. Gross margin improved in both segments in 2017 due to the combination of improved industry pricing, solid project execution and favorable contract terms which allowed for incremental margin on multiple jobs.\nOperating Income\nThe Company reported operating income of $6.0 million for the full year 2017 compared to operating income of $4.1 million for the prior year period. The increase in operating income was due primarily to the combination of revenue growth coupled with improved gross margins, which more than offset increased Selling, General and Administrative expenses.\nSelling, General and Administrative expense increased 15.7% to $56.0 million in 2017, compared with $48.4 million in 2016. SG&A expense growth was driven by a combination of planned increases in corporate infrastructure to support Company growth objectives along with under-budgeted, non-recurring costs associated with remediation efforts related to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. As a percentage of total revenue, 2017 SG&A accounted for 11.5% compared with 10.8% of total revenue in 2016.\nBacklog\nAggregate backlog at December 31, 2017 was $461.4 million, an increase of 6.2% compared with $434.3 million at December 31, 2016. Within the aggregate backlog figures, Construction backlog at December 31, 2017 was $426.7 million, an increase of 9.3% from $390.2 million at December 31, 2016. In addition, Service backlog at December 30, 2017 was $34.7 million compared to $44.1 million as of December 31, 2016. The Company expects approximately $302.0 million of total backlog to be converted to revenues within the current fiscal year.\nBalance Sheet\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had current assets of $166.3 million and current liabilities of $135.5 million, representing a current ratio of 1.23x. Working capital was $30.8 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $2.3 million or 8.1% from December 31, 2016. Long-term debt, net of the current portion and debt issuance costs, was $20.6 million at December 31, 2017, down from $21.5 million at December 31, 2016. The Company was in compliance with all bank covenants as of December 31, 2017.\n2018 Guidance\nThe Company is introducing guidance for 2018, summarized in the table below.\nFY 2018 Estimate Revenues $510 - $530 million Adjusted EBITDA $20 - $24 million Conference Call Details\nDate: Tuesday, April 3, 2018 Time: 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time Participant Dial-In Numbers: Domestic callers: (866) 604-1698 International callers: (201) 389-0844 Access by Webcast\nThe call will also be simultaneously webcast over the Internet via the “Investor Relations” section of LMB’s website at www.limbachinc.com or by clicking on the conference call link: http://limbachinc.equisolvewebcast.com/q4-2017 .

The key measure is Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, and taxes, as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of, when applicable, other non-cash expenses or expenses that are unusual or non-recurring. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is meaningful to our investors to enhance their understanding of our financial performance for the current period and our ability to generate cash flows from operations that are available for taxes, capital expenditures and debt service. We understand that Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a measure of financial performance and to compare our performance with the performance of other companies that report Adjusted EBITDA. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, however, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. When assessing our operating performance, investors and others should not consider this data in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP. Further, the results presented by Adjusted EBITDA cannot be achieved without incurring the costs that the measure excludes.
