    "text": "BEDMINSTER, NJ, April 18, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Peapack-Gladstone Financial Corporation (NASDAQ Global Select Market: PGC) and Peapack-Gladstone Bank proudly announce the launch of a Professional Services Group, which will be led by William C. Gascoigne. This team will focus on providing customized solutions to meet the specific needs of attorneys and CPAs.\nWilliam C. Gascoigne, Senior Managing Director, Professional Services Group, Peapack-Gladstone Bank\nA resident of Morris County, NJ, Bill is a career banker and tenured leader with over 40 years of financial industry experience. For the last 14 years he has held the position of Senior Vice President at Capital One Bank, working as the single point of contact and trusted advisor for professional firms and their middle market clients in the NJ-NY markets.\n“I’ve known Bill for over 25 years,” said Doug Kennedy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Peapack-Gladstone Bank. “We recognize the need to grow our professional services business, and Bill is the right person for the job. He has the drive and commitment we need to make this a strong and impactful offering for the Bank.”\nSimilar to the recent launch of the Bank’s Corporate Advisory Group, which offers independent, unbiased and objective advice to middle market companies and their owners, developing the Professional Services Group is an integral step in the Bank’s growth. Peapack-Gladstone Bank is dedicated to delivering smart ideas to improve financial performance and to providing proactive and sound financial recommendations to professional firms. Bill and his team understand the needs and challenges of professional service firms and will offer collection, payment and liquidity management solutions like MyEscrow, PGB’s new virtual sub-accounting solution, to provide clients maximum control, processing efficiency and convenience. This group is also very experienced in meeting all the borrowing needs of professional service firms and their partners.\n“I am excited to join this well-regarded institution,” stated Gascoigne. “Peapack-Gladstone Bank’s private banking style is unique, and there’s a lot of opportunity in the market to not only provide the right products and solutions – which is a given – but to build solid and meaningful relationships on both a business and personal level.”\nMr. Gascoigne holds an MBA in Finance from Rutgers University and a BA in Economics from the University of Virginia. Over his long career, Bill has served on several non-profit boards including Junior Achievement of NJ, The United Way of Essex and West Hudson and the Mental Health Association of Essex and West Hudson. He is currently a member of the Board of Directors for the Tri-County Scholarship Fund and a former president of his home golf club, the Rockaway River Country Club.\nAbout the Company\nPeapack-Gladstone Financial Corporation is a New Jersey bank holding company with total assets of $4.26 billion as of December 31, 2017. Founded in 1921, Peapack-Gladstone Bank is a commercial bank that provides innovative private banking services to businesses, non-profits and consumers, which help them to establish, maintain and expand their legacy.
