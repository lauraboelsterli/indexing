A sauropod footprint discovered at Brothers' Point on the Isle of Skye in Scotland is seen in this undated photograph supplied by Edinburgh University on April 2, 2018. Jon Hoad/Edinburgh University/Handout via REUTERS \n“The more we look on the Isle of Skye, the more dinosaur footprints we find,” said Dr Steve Brusatte of the University of Edinburgh’s School of GeoSciences. \n“This new site records two different types of dinosaurs — long-necked cousins of Brontosaurus and sharp-toothed cousins of T. rex — hanging around a shallow lagoon, back when Scotland was much warmer and dinosaurs were beginning their march to global dominance.” \nThe find is globally important as it is rare evidence of the Middle Jurassic period, from which few fossil sites have been found around the world, the university said on its website. Slideshow (4 Images) \nThe footprints were difficult to study owing to tidal conditions, the impact of weathering and changes to the landscape, it added. \nBut researchers managed to identify two trackways in addition to many isolated footprints. \nThey used drone photographs to make a map of the site while other images were collected using a paired set of cameras and tailored software to help model the prints. \nThe study, carried out by the University of Edinburgh, Staffin Museum and Chinese Academy of Sciences, was published in the Scottish Journal of Geology.
