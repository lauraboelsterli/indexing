Too hard, and they increase the risk of concussion.\nBecause of that, the NFL, the NCAA and researchers at multiple universities are paying attention to how, and how often, playing surfaces contribute to injuries.\nAn analysis of 459 concussions documented in the National Football League over the 2015 and 2016 seasons found that 19% were caused when a player’s head hit the ground.\nAn examination of 41,000 National Collegiate Athletic Association football injuries from 2004 to 2009, which wasn’t limited to concussions, attributed more than 7% to contact with the field.\n“We tried to look at the value across all injuries,” said John Parsons, managing director of the NCAA Sport Science Institute. “It could be contusion to concussion.”\nYounger athletes are also susceptible.\nResearchers at the Children’s Hospitals in Boston and Columbus, Ohio, found that about 15% of concussions in high-school sports happened when players hit the ground. The study of 544 concussions included a representative sample of athletes playing sports ranging from soccer to softball, in the 2008-09 school year.\nRock and a Hard Place The hardness of different surfaces as measured by the Clegg Impact Soil Tester method Recommendation for playing fields\nTiled concrete\nbasement floor\nFrozen grass\npractice fields\nCarpet and pad on\ntiled concrete floor\nHigh school\ngrass fields\nCarpet and pad on\nhardwood floor\n0 Gmax\n1,500\n500\n1,000\nNote: Gmax represents maximum deceleration\nSource: Penn State University\nTo help address the problem, the NFL, under intense scrutiny for player concussions, has instituted a policy to check fields for safety and playability before every game. Within 72 hours of each home game, NFL teams must test their fields for hardness and certify that they comply with league rules. Fields that are too hard must be fixed and retested before game day.\nIn addition to hardness, grass fields are tested for moisture, while synthetic fields are tested for depth of infill, a substance such as crumb rubber that cushions artificial surfaces.\n“If you ever watch a game played on a synthetic surface, you’ll see infill flying around,” said Richard Kent, deputy director of the Center for Applied Biomechanics at the University of Virginia . “Thousands of pounds a year will walk off a well-used field. You’ve got to put it back.”\nDry, compacted grass turf and depleted infill are characteristics that contribute to the hardness of natural and artificial fields, but the level of hardness is commonly measured with a device called the Clegg Impact Soil Tester.\n“Every location on the field has to be under 100 Gmax,” said Andy McNitt, director of the Penn State Center for Sports Surface Research and a member of a team that oversees the NFL field certification program .\nGmax is a measure of how fast something stops on impact. The higher the number—which is recorded in gravity units, or “G’s”—the harder the surface.\nBecause there is some debate over whether Gmax measurements correlate with injuries, Dr. McNitt said, the NFL regards the 100 G threshold as a way to gauge whether a field is properly maintained, rather than as a measure of its safety—although the two are related.\n“We think if you take care of a field, you can keep it under 100 G’s, and it will be more playable and safe,” Dr. McNitt said. “But that’s an assumption.”\nTo put the limit into perspective: A carpeted hardwood floor measures around 134 Gmax on the Clegg. (Other devices use a different scale.) A frozen practice field measures around 303. And a tiled concrete floor measures around 1,280.\nThe Clegg model used by the NFL is fitted with a 5-pound weight that is dropped through a guide tube from a height of 18 inches.\nTesters checking NFL playing fields must report the results from 40 different locations, but they might test as many as 150 locations, including areas in the sidelines.\nThe method grew out of Ford and General Motors crash-test research from the 1960s and from data collected in 1971 on the impact of blows to the head during a football game. But the approach, which measures the impact of a flat-faced weight dropped straight down, doesn’t account for torque or other elements that may influence trauma when a head or other body part slams into the ground.\nAs field-safety research progresses, Dr. Kent said, it’s likely that the method will be refined.\nStill, in the absence of a better measure, the information can give field managers some sense of the safety and playability of athletic surfaces—which in turn will contribute to improvements in sports equipment such as helmets and cleats.\nTo encourage all field managers to keep tabs on the condition of their athletic surfaces, the Sports Turf Managers Association offers its members a questionnaire to help them conduct a thorough assessment of field conditions.\n“If there are red flags going up, they can take the appropriate steps to change up fields,” said Brad Fresenburg, a field-management expert who helped design the latest version of the questionnaire, which can be filled out electronically.\nThe hope is that when athletes do go down, they’re less likely to be sidelined by the turf.\nWrite to Jo Craven McGinty at Jo.McGinty@wsj.com",
