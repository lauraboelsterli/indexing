    "text": "BOSTON, The Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston announced its preliminary, unaudited first quarter financial results for 2018, reporting net income of $55.1 million for the quarter. The Bank expects to file its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 31, 2018, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission next month.\nThe Bank's board of directors also declared a dividend equal to an annual yield of 5.46 percent, the approximate daily average three-month LIBOR yield for the first quarter of 2018 plus 350 basis points. The dividend, based on average stock outstanding for the first quarter of 2018, will be paid on May 2, 2018. The board expects to follow this formula for declaring cash dividends through 2018, though a quarterly loss or a significant, adverse event or trend could cause a dividend to be suspended or reduced.\n\"Earnings were solid again in the first quarter due to an increase in net interest income, driven by increases in net interest spread, margin and earning assets. Our balance sheet remains stable and strong as well. We are pleased to continue to pay a dividend of three-month LIBOR plus 350 basis points, or 5.46 percent for the quarter,\" said President and CEO Edward A. Hjerpe III. \"We remain committed to stimulating job growth and retention, as well as economic development, in our region through our Jobs for New England (JNE) program. The Bank has disbursed $12.7 million in JNE advances to member financial institutions already this year.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Operating Highlights\nNet income for the quarter ending March 31, 2018, was $55.1 million, compared with net income of $37.4 million for the same period in 2017. The improvement in net income for the quarter was primarily due to a $17.3 million increase in net interest income after provision for credit losses. These results led to a $6.2 million contribution to the Bank's Affordable Housing Program for the quarter.\nNet interest income after provision for credit losses for the quarter ending March 31, 2018, was $79.9 million, compared with $62.6 million for the same period in 2017. The $17.3 million improvement was mainly a result of a higher interest rate environment, which enabled the Bank to earn higher income on capital, as well as a higher net interest spread. This improvement was partially offset by a reduction of net interest income resulting from a $1.3 million decrease of accretion of significant improvement in projected cash flows (1) associated with previously impaired private-label mortgage backed securities, from $8.6 million in the first quarter of 2017 to $7.3 million in the first quarter of 2018.\nNet interest spread was 0.42 percent for the quarter ending March 31, 2018, a six basis point increase from the same period in 2017, and net interest margin was 0.52 percent, a nine basis point increase from the same period in 2017. The increase in net interest spread reflects a 65 basis point increase in the average yield on earning assets and a 59 basis point increase in the average yield on interest-bearing liabilities. The expansion of net interest spread and net interest margin was primarily attributable to higher interest rates which led to lower premium amortization on U.S. Agency mortgage-backed securities, and a $2.3 billion increase in average earning assets. The increase in average earnings assets was primarily driven by a $1.6 billion increase in average advances.\nMarch 31, 2018 Balance-Sheet Highlights\nTotal assets increased $596.2 million, or 1.0 percent, to $61.0 billion at March 31, 2018, up from $60.4 billion at year-end 2017. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, advances increased $421.8 million, or 1.1 percent, to $38.0 billion, compared with $37.6 billion at year-end 2017. The increase in advances was primarily in variable-rate advances, partially offset by a decrease in short-term fixed-rate advances.\nTotal investments were $18.7 billion at March 31, 2018, up from $17.9 billion at the prior year end, and investments in mortgage loans totaled $4.0 billion at March 31, 2018, an increase of $22.3 million from year-end 2017.\nMandatorily redeemable capital stock increased $190,000 to $36.1 million as of March 31, 2018, from $35.9 million as of year-end 2017. GAAP capital at March 31, 2018, was $3.3 billion, an increase of $53.4 million from year-end 2017. During 2018, capital stock increased by $40.2 million, resulting from issuance of $408.3 million of capital stock to support new advances borrowings by members offset by capital stock repurchases of $367.9 million. Total retained earnings grew to $1.3 billion during 2018, an increase of $27.2 million, or 2.1 percent, from December 31, 2017. Of this amount, restricted retained earnings totaled $278.3 million at March 31, 2018. Accumulated other comprehensive loss totaled $340.8 million at March 31, 2018, an increase of $13.9 million, or 4.3 percent, from December 31, 2017.\nThe Bank was in compliance with all regulatory capital ratios at March 31, 2018, and in the most recent information available was classified \"adequately capitalized\" by its regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, based on the Bank's financial information at December 31, 2017.

This adjusted yield is used to calculate the amount to be recognized into income over the remaining life of the security so as to match the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected. Subsequent changes in estimated cash flows that are deemed significant will change the accretable yield on a prospective basis.\n(2)\nFor additional information on the Bank's capital requirements, see Item 7 — Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Capital in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, filed with the SEC on March 16, 2018 (the 2017 Annual Report).\n(3)\nInvestments include available-for-sale securities, held-to-maturity securities, trading securities, interest-bearing deposits, securities purchased under agreements to resell, and federal funds sold.\n(4)\nThe Bank's capital plan and a joint capital enhancement agreement among all Federal Home Loan Banks require the Bank to allocate a certain amount, generally not less than 20 percent of each of quarterly net income and adjustments to prior net income, to a restricted retained earnings account until a total required allocation is met. Amounts in the restricted retained earnings account are unavailable to be paid as dividends, which may be paid from current net income and unrestricted retained earnings. For additional information, see Item 5 — Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in the 2017 Annual Report.\n(5)\nMVE equals the difference between the theoretical market value of assets and the theoretical market value of liabilities, and the ratio of MVE to par value of Bank capital stock can be an indicator of future net income to the extent that it demonstrates the impact of prior interest-rate movements on the capacity of the current balance sheet to generate net interest income. However, this ratio does not always provide an accurate indication of future net income. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on this ratio and are encouraged to read the Bank's discussion of MVE, including discussion of the limitations of MVE as a metric, in Item 7A — Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk — Measurement of Market and Interest Rate Risk in the 2017 Annual Report.\n(6)\nYields for quarterly periods are annualized.\n(7)\nReturn on average equity is net income divided by the total of the average daily balance of outstanding Class B capital stock, accumulated other comprehensive loss, and total retained earnings.\nSafe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\nThis release, including the unaudited balance sheet highlights and income statement highlights, uses forward-looking statements within the meaning of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based on the Bank's expectations as of the date hereof.
