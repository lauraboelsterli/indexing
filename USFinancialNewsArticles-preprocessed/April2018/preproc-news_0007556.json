    "text": "43 COMMENTS The U.S.’s tit-for-tat with China over tariffs has ushered in a high-stakes standoff over the future of trade between the world’s two largest economies.\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. proposed a 25% tariff on some 1,300 Chinese goods , unveiling the most aggressive challenge in decades to Beijing’s trade practices. The items range from high value-added goods such as medicines and medical equipment to intermediate goods like machine tools and chemicals, according to a release by the U.S. Trade Representative. On Wednesday, China retaliated by targeting 106 high-value American exports , from airplanes to soybeans, in a tactic Beijing officials say is meant to secure a truce.\nHere is the universe of goods included in the proposed tariffs on both sides.\nTariff Targets\nA wide range of goods would be affected by the recently announced levies.\nMachinery, mechanical\nappliances, electrical\nequipment\nFood, beverages,\ntobacco\nAnimals\nBase metals\nChemicals\nTextiles, apparel\nMineral fuels\nVehicles, aircraft\nPlastics and rubber\nMiscellaneous\nVegetables\nValue of 2017 Chinese exports to the U.S. affected by U.S. tariffs:\n$46.2 billion\nValue of 2017 U.S. exports to China affected by Chinese tariffs:\n$49.8 billion\nTelevisions\n$3.9 billion\nLarger passenger vehicles\n$6.5 billion\nLarger aircraft*\n$16.3 billion\nMidsize cars\n$1.5 billion\nCotton\n$971 million\nSoybeans\n$12.4 billion\nPropane\n$1.7 billion\nElectric vehicles\n$1.5 billion\nAluminum alloy\n$1.1 billion\nTariff Targets\nA wide range of goods would be affected by the recently announced levies.\nMachinery, mechanical\nappliances, electrical\nequipment\nFood, beverages,\ntobacco\nAnimals\nBase metals\nChemicals\nTextiles, apparel\nMineral fuels\nVehicles, aircraft\nPlastics and rubber\nMiscellaneous\nVegetables\nValue of 2017 U.S. exports to China affected by Chinese tariffs:\n$49.8 billion\nPropane\n$1.7 billion\nCotton\n$971 million\nElectric vehicles\n$1.5 billion\nValue of 2017 Chinese exports to the U.S. affected by U.S. tariffs:\n$46.2 billion\nMidsize cars\n$1.5 billion\nTelevisions\n$3.9 billion\nAluminum alloy\n$1.1 billion\nTariff Targets\nA wide range of goods would be affected\nby the recently announced levies.\nFood, beverages,\ntobacco\nMachinery, mechanical\nappliances, electrical\nequipment\nAnimals\nBase metals\nTextiles, apparel\nChemicals\nMineral fuels\nVehicles, aircraft\nPlastics and rubber\nMiscellaneous\nVegetables\nValue of 2017 Chinese exports to the U.S. affected by U.S. tariffs:\n$46.2 billion\nValue of 2017 U.S. exports to China affected by Chinese tariffs:\n$49.8 billion\nLarger\npassenger vehicles\n$6.5 billion\nTelevisions\n$3.9 billion\nLarger aircraft*\n$16.3 billion\nMidsize cars\n$1.5 billion\nCotton\n$971 million\nSoybeans\n$12.4 billion\nElectric vehicles\n$1.5 billion\nPropane\n$1.7 billion\nAluminum alloy\n$1.1 billion\nTariff Targets\nA wide range of goods would be affected by the recently announced levies.\nMachinery, mechanical\nappliances, electrical\nequipment\nAnimals\nBase metals\nChemicals\nMineral fuels\nPlastics and rubber\nFood, beverages, tobacco\nMiscellaneous\nVegetables\nTextiles, apparel\nVehicles, aircraft\nValue of 2017 U.S. exports to China affected by Chinese tariffs:\n$49.8 billion\nPropane\n$1.7 billion\nCotton\n$971 million\nValue of 2017 Chinese exports to the U.S. affected by U.S. tariffs:\n$46.2 billion\nTelevisions\n$3.9 billion\nMidsize cars\n$1.5 billion\nAluminum alloy\n$1.1 billion\n*Airplanes and other aircraft; of an unladen weight exceeding 33,000lbs.
