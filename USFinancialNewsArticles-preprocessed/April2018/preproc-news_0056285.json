A global Phase III trial intended to support a future U.S. Biologic License Application (BLA) started in 2017. TiGenix has entered into a licensing agreement with Takeda, a global pharmaceutical company active in gastroenterology, under which Takeda acquired the exclusive right to develop and commercialize Alofisel for complex perianal fistulas outside the U.S. TiGenix' second adipose-derived product, Cx611, is undergoing a Phase I/II trial in severe sepsis - a major cause of mortality in the developed world. TiGenix is headquartered in Leuven (Belgium) and has operations in Madrid (Spain) and Cambridge, MA (USA).

Reopening The Bid must or may be reopened in the following instances:\nVoluntary reopening (less than 85%)\nIf there have been tendered into the Bid and the US Offer, in aggregate, a number of securities (i.e., Shares, Warrants and ADSs) that, together with all securities of the Target (i.e., shares) owned by the Bidder and its affiliates, represents or gives access to less than 85% of the voting rights represented or given access to by all of the outstanding securities of the Target (i.e., shares, Warrants and ADSs) on a fully diluted basis as of the end of the First Acceptance Period, then one of the Conditions has not been satisfied and the Bidder will have the right to withdraw from the Bid and the U.S. Offer.\nIn such case, the Bidder will have to announce, at the date of announcement of the results of the First Acceptance Period, whether or not it will use its right to waive such Condition.\nIn such case, the Bidder also reserves the right to voluntarily reopen the Bid at its sole discretion, which in the Agreement the Bidder has undertaken to do if it decides to waive the Condition (subject to all other Conditions being satisfied or waived). Such a voluntary reopening will commence on the tenth (10) business day following the announcement of the results of the First Acceptance Period, for a subsequent Acceptance Period of at least ten (10) and maximum fifteen (15) business days.

The Bidder shall allow the holders of Warrants to tender their Shares (obtained as a result of the exercise of such Warrants) in the Bid pending the effective issue of these Shares.\nMandatory reopening (at least 90%)\nIf the Bidder (together with its affiliates) holds at least 90% of the securities with voting right of the Target (i.e., of all outstanding shares (including such shares as are represented by ADSs) of the Target) following the expiry of the First Acceptance Period, there will be a mandatory reopening of the Bid in accordance with article 35, 1° of the Belgian Royal Decree of 27 April 2007 on public takeover bids (the \" Royal Decree \").\nThe mandatory reopening pursuant to article 35, 1° of the Royal Decree will also apply if the aforementioned threshold of 90% has not immediately been met as a result of the First Acceptance Period, but has been met after the voluntary reopening referred to above.\nIn case of a mandatory reopening pursuant to article 35, 1° of the Royal Decree, the Bid will reopen within ten (10) business days following the announcement of the results of the last preceding Acceptance Period for a subsequent Acceptance Period of at least five (5) and maximum fifteen (15) business days.
