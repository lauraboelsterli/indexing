    "text": "Atlanta shortstop Dansby Swanson had three hits and three RBIs and Ozzie Albies homered to trigger a four-run first inning as the Braves beat Colorado 8-3 in the coldest home opener in Rockies franchise history at Coors Field on Friday.\nRight-hander Brandon McCarthy pitched six innings for the victory and drove in two runs with a double, the first extra-base hit in his 13-year career spent mostly in the American League, as the Braves (5-2) set a franchise record with 56 runs in their first seven games. They lead the majors in runs.\nCarlos Gonzalez homered and drove in two runs, Trevor Story homered and Chris Iannetta had two doubles for the Rockies (4-4) in a game that was delayed 61 minutes at the start by inclement weather. It was 27 degrees at first pitch.\nFreddie Freeman and Preston Tucker had a single and an RBI for Atlanta, off to its best start since the 2015 team opened 6-1. Freeman has 10 RBIs and Tucker has nine this season, and Swanson has four multiple-hit games.\nMcCarthy, obtained from the Los Angeles Dodgers in the offseason, gave up five hits and three runs in six innings while winning his first two starts for the second straight season. He struck out four and walked one.\nAtlanta batted around in a four-run first inning off right-hander German Marquez (0-1). Albies hit a one-out homer on the sixth pitch of the game before two walks and a Kurt Suzuki singled loaded the bases. Tucker hit a sacrifice fly to drive in one, and Swanson’s two-out triple made it 4-0.\nGonzalez’s two-out triple drove in Nolan Arenado in the last of the first inning, and Gonzalez and Story homered in the fourth inning to make it 4-3.\nTucker walked with two out and scored on Swanson’s double in the fifth inning, and McCarthy drove a two-run double into the right-center field gap after Ryan Flaherty was intentionally walked for a 7-3 lead, knocking out Marquez.\nMarquez gave seven hits and seven runs in 4 2/3 innings. He walked six and struck out two.\nFreeman singled in a run in the sixth.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
