    "text": "April 9 (Reuters) - Shares in India’s Lemon Tree Hotels Ltd closed 28 percent higher on their trading debut on Monday after the company’s initial public offering raised nearly $160 million.\nLemon Tree shares closed at 71.65 rupees on the National Stock Exchange, after hitting a high of 73.90 rupees. The shares were sold at 56 rupees in the IPO.\nLemon Tree’s strong listing is a rare success in India’s volatile stock markets this year where most of the recent trading debuts have been lacklustre.\nFive of the eight companies that held initial share sales in March have listed at a discount to their issue prices.\nCompanies in India have raised about $2.8 billion from IPOs so far this year, following a record $11 billion in 2017.
