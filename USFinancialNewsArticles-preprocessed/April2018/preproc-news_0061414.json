    "text": "April 30, 2018 / 1:40 PM / Updated 19 minutes ago U.S. Supreme Court to hear Google privacy settlement dispute Andrew Chung 1 Min Read\nApril 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear an internet privacy case involving Google that could put the brakes on an increasingly common form of settlement in class action suits that funnels money to unrelated third parties and charities instead of to people affected by the alleged wrongdoing.\nThe justices will take up an appeal by opponents, led by a conservative group, challenging the $8.5 million that Google agreed to pay in 2013 to settle claims that the search engine operator allowed other websites to see usersâ€™ search queries, violating their privacy rights. The settlement was upheld by a lower court. Google is part of Alphabet Inc. Reporting by Andrew Chung; Editing by Will Dunham",
