    "text": "Rhys Hoskins capped a seven-pitch at-bat with his fourth home run of the season, a three-run shot that erased a sixth-inning deficit and lifted the Philadelphia Phillies to a 6-2 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Saturday afternoon in Philadelphia.\nHoskins also contributed a run-scoring single to a three-run eighth inning, giving him four RBIs in the game, as the Phillies beat the Pirates for the third time in three days.\nSean Rodriguez homered for Pittsburgh, which lost for the fifth time in its last six games.\nPirates left-hander Steven Brault took a one-hit shutout and 2-0 lead into the sixth inning before, with one out, he hit Carlos Santana with a pitch.\nAfter Odubel Herrera singled, right-hander Michael Feliz (0-1) replaced Brault and got ahead of Hoskins 0-2 before the slugger fouled off three pitches in the marathon at-bat.\nHoskins then smacked his three-run homer to left field, giving the Phillies a lead they never relinquished.\nThe Phillies tacked on against the Pittsburgh bullpen in the eighth, with Hoskins and Scott Kingery driving in runs that created a three-run margin. Hoskins made it 6-2 when he scored on a throwing error by Pirates first baseman David Freese.\nCloser Hector Neris, who got the final out of the eighth inning, pitched a scoreless ninth for his fourth save.\nAaron Nola (2-1) got the win for the Phillies, allowing two runs and six hits in seven innings. He struck out nine and did not walk a batter.\nOne of the hits allowed by Nola was Rodriguez’s third home run of the season, which came on the second pitch of the game.\nBrault did not get a decision after allowing just two hits and two runs in 5 1/3 innings. He walked three and struck out four.\nHoskins finished with two hits for the Phillies, who have won 10 of their last 12 games.\nSantana and Herrera scored twice apiece.\nRodriguez had two hits and scored twice for the Pirates, who out-hit the Phillies 8-7.\nCorey Dickerson also had a pair of hits for Pittsburgh.\n—Field Level Media\n 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
