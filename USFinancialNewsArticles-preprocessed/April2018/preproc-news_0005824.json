The move came in response to U.S. duties on imports of aluminum and steel.\n“That’s going to start stoking fears of trade wars and protectionism. The market doesn’t really like that,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey.\n“And if it escalates, the questions could be on if China is going to buy our bonds. We have speculation out there, but it could be some profit taking and some risk-off mentality for the moment.”\nTrump is separately preparing to impose tariffs of more than $50 billion targeting “largely high-technology” Chinese products.\nAt 9:56 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 46.7 points, or 0.19 percent, at 24,056.41.\nThe S&P 500 was down 17.81 points, or 0.67 percent, at 2,623.06 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 83.60 points, or 1.18 percent, at 6,979.84.\nTen of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with only utilities gaining.\nFacebook was down as the data scandal last month continued to weigh. On Monday, brokerage Pivotal Research slashed its price target, citing a faster-than-expected deceleration in the social media company’s revenue growth.\nHumana jumped about 7 percent after a report that Walmart was in early-stage talks with the health insurer about developing closer ties, with acquisition discussed as one possibility. Walmart fell more than 2 percent.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE for a 1.78-to-1 ratio and for a 2.03-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
