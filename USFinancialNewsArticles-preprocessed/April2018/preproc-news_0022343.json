    "text": "April 10, 2018 / 9:41 PM / Updated 31 minutes ago Motorcycling-Pedrosa doubtful for Austin MotoGP after wrist surgery Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nApril 10 (Reuters) - Honda MotoGP rider Dani Pedrosa is doubtful for this month’s Grand Prix of the Americas in Austin, Texas, after having surgery to his wrist in Barcelona on Tuesday. \nThe Spanish veteran, whose career has been plagued by operations, was injured in a crash at the Argentine Grand Prix on Sunday. \nHis Repsol Honda works team said in a statement that Pedrosa had suffered an intra-articular fracture of the right distal radius. The break was fixed with a titanium screw in the operation. \n“If the results are positive, he will be able to begin his rehabilitation on Saturday,” the team said. \n“His participation in the Austin GP will be decided consequently.” \nAustin’s Circuit of the Americas hosts the third round of the season on April 22.
