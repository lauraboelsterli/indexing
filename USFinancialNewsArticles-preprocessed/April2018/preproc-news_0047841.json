Soccer Football - Championship - Derby County v Cardiff City - Pride Park, Derby, Britain - April 24, 2018 Derby County's Richard Keogh celebrates with Alex Pearce after Cameron Jerome scores their third goal Action Images/Andrew Boyers \nCameron Jerome scored twice against his old club either side of a Matej Vydra strike in the second half after Cardiff led through Callum Paterson’s volley on the half-hour. \nThe result leaves second-placed Cardiff one point ahead of Fulham with two games left, while Derby have moved back up to the sixth and final playoff spot, two points above Millwall. Slideshow (3 Images) \nThe top two sides receive automatic promotion to the Premier League, with the next four teams battling it out in the playoffs for one more spot. \nCardiff will have to win at Hull City on Saturday and against visiting Reading to clinch promotion if Fulham win at home to relegated Sunderland on Friday and at Birmingham City. \nWolverhampton Wanderers, who have already won automatic promotion as champions, have 98 points ahead of Cardiff (86), Fulham (85), Aston Villa (83), Middlesbrough (72) and Derby (71), who visit Villa on Saturday when ‘Boro host Millwall.
