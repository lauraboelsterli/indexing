Nevertheless, the company said it boosted advertising sales and reduced expenses.\nCo-Chief Executive Alfonso de Angoitia said he expected various units of the company to benefit in the next quarter from broadcasting the soccer World Cup, which begins in June.\nShares of Televisa were up 4.35 percent on Friday, trading at 66.89 pesos per share, after the call.
