Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras welcomes European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker at the Maximos Mansion in Athens, Greece, April 26, 2018. REUTERS/Alkis Konstantinidis\nJuncker, who was visiting Athens, also said that the achievements of Greece, which implemented broad reforms in return for bailout funds, were “excellent”.\n“We want to apply every effort to ensure that the exit of Greece from the bailout is a clean one. And that there will not be any precautionary line,” Juncker said in comments translated into Greek after meeting Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras.
