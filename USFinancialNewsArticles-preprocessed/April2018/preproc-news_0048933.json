    "text": " 32 AM / Updated 19 minutes ago Volvo Trucks plans to share electric truck battery tech across brands Naomi Tajitsu 3 Min Read \nTOKYO (Reuters) - Volvo Trucks plans to share battery technology across its brands to tame development and production costs for the crucial but expensive component, as the world’s second-largest truck maker ramps up electric offerings, the company told Reuters on Monday. The logo of UD Trucks is seen in Tokyo, Japan April 23, 2018. REUTERS/Toru Hanai \nAs vehicle makers face growing costs to develop lower-emission vehicles and automated driving capabilities, Volvo Trucks, owned by Sweden’s Volvo AB ( VOLVb.ST ), said it would “absolutely” make sense for its brands - which include Japan’s UD Trucks, Sweden’s Scania and Mack Trucks in the United States - to share battery technology. \n“We’re really striving to reuse a lot when it comes to expensive components, which are expensive when it comes to development and production costs ... not only between the truck brands but also the bus brands and construction equipment,” Lars Stenqvist, chief technology officer at Volvo Group Trucks Technology, said in an interview.
