    "text": "HOLLISTON, Mass., April 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Biostage, Inc. (OTCQB: BSTG) (\"Biostage\" or the \"Company\"), a biotechnology company developing bioengineered organ implants to treat life-threatening conditions of the esophagus, bronchus and trachea, today announced financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nSummary of Financial Results\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported a net loss of approximately $1.2 million, or a net loss per diluted share of $0.61, compared to a net loss of approximately $3.3 million, or a net loss per diluted share of $3.91 for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The $2.1 million decrease in net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was mainly attributable to reduced spending due to the Company's headcount reduction in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nFor the full year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported a net loss of approximately $11.9 million, or a net loss per diluted share of $6.63, compared to a net loss of approximately $11.6 million, or a net loss per diluted share of $14.49 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $0.3 million increased net loss for 2017 was primarily attributable to higher research and development spending on outsourced preclinical studies, scientific conferences, and employee-related costs during the first half of 2017 that were offset, in part, by reduced spending due to the Company's headcount reduction in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nReduced the Company's staffing to preserve cash Secured $4.2 million private placement to extend operational runway\nRecent Highlights\nPublished successful results of pre-clinical study demonstrating esophageal regeneration in large animals Announced the first successful in-human use of a Cellspan ™ implant to regenerate a patient's esophagus Expanded the Company's scientific expertise by appointing Dr. Christine Finck and Dr. Charles Cox, Jr. to its Scientific Advisory Board Appointed Jason Chen as the Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors in connection with plans to expand into the Chinese market Completed an additional $1 million private placement Awarded SBIR Fast-Track grant to develop Cellspan™ Esophageal Implant (CEI) as a novel treatment for esophageal atresia in pediatric patients Appointed distinguished children's hospital executive James Shmerling to Board of Directors\nJim McGorry, Biostage's CEO, commented, \"During the fourth quarter of 2017 we weathered a liquidity crisis by conducting a headcount reduction to reduce our expenses. We were looking at the time to conserve cash and to preserve our technology while seeking an investor to extend the company's runway. We closed a $4.2 million private placement at year-end with a group of fundamental investors who see a significant opportunity for our Cellframe ™ technology to address China's large esophageal cancer patient population as well as the value our technology may bring to children with esophageal atresia.\"\nMr. McGorry continued, \"Since that private placement, we have closed an additional $1 million private placement, bolstered our staffing in all key areas of research and development, and added two new experts to our Scientific Advisory Board. We also have made significant progress in moving our esophageal atresia pre-clinical program forward though our collaboration with Connecticut Children's Medical Center. Most notably we recently announced that we have been informed by the surgeon that our esophageal implant product candidate had successfully prompted esophageal regeneration in a first-in-human surgical procedure performed at a major U.S. hospital in May 2017. We believe this is a clear demonstration of our technology's potential for improving human care. We are also excited about the operational runway our new investors have provided us and the progress we are making in moving our esophageal implant product candidates toward Investigational New Drug applications, which we anticipate to occur in 2019.\"\nThe Company ended 2017 with approximately $4.0 million of cash on-hand. Based on management's current projections, it believes it has sufficient cash on hand to fund operations partially through the third quarter of 2018.\nAbout Biostage, Inc.\nBiostage is a biotechnology company developing bioengineered organ implants based on the Company's Cellframe ™ technology which combines a proprietary biocompatible scaffold with a patient's own stem cells to create Cellspan organ implants. Cellspan implants are being developed to treat life-threatening conditions of the esophagus, bronchus or trachea with the hope of dramatically improving the treatment paradigm for patients. Based on its preclinical data, Biostage has selected life-threatening conditions of the esophagus as the initial clinical application of its technology.\nFor more information, please visit www.biostage.com and connect with the Company on Twitter and LinkedIn .\nForward-Looking Statements:\nSome of the statements in this press release are \"forward-looking\" and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
