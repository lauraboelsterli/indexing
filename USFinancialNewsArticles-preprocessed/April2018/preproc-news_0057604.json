Blockchain is a revolutionary digital technology that allows digital information to be distributed but not copied. Labelled by some as \"the backbone of a new type of internet\", it can be used for many kinds of applications. Most experts believe blockchain technology is revolutionizing industries from the bottom-up and to create new business models such as a peer-to-peer communities. However, many of them are far less certain about the future of cryptocurrencies as the markets continue to ebb and flow without any level of consistency. Many agree that blockchain, the technology behind digital currency, is vitally important for the financial world and record-keeping in general. The markets may become more enthusiastic about some of the companies that will rush to advance and improve blockchain technology to address the safety and security issues cryptocurrencies are now facing. Active companies today include: Block One Capital Inc. (TSX-V: BLOK) (OTC: BKPPF), HashChain Technology Inc. (TSX-V: KASH) (OTC:HSSHF), Global Blockchain Technologies Corp (CSE: BLOC) (OTC: BLKCF), Net Element, Inc. (NASDAQ: NETE), MGT Capital Investments, Inc. (OTC: MGTI).\nBlock One Capital Inc. (TSXV: BLOK.V) (OTCQB: BKPPF) BREAKING NEWS: Block One Capital, an investment company focused on high growth opportunities in the blockchain sector, is pleased to announce the completion of its previously announced non-brokered placement of 2,000,000 units (the \"Units\") at a price of $1.00 per Unit for gross proceeds of $2,000,000 (the \"Offering\"). Each Unit consists of one (1) common share in the capital of the Company (a \"Share\") and one-half (1/2) of one common share purchase warrant (each whole warrant, a \"Warrant\"). Each Warrant is exercisable to acquire one additional Share at a price of $1.50 for a period of two (2) years from the date of closing. In the event that the Shares trade at a closing price of greater than $2.50 per Share for ten (10) consecutive trading days, the Company may accelerate the expiry date of the Warrants to expire on the 30th day after the date on which such notice is given by Block One.\nThe Company believes that the net proceeds from the Offering, together with its existing cash on hand, revenues from investments and unrealized gains on investments, position it well to continue to expand its investment portfolio. To this end, the Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to fund its ongoing investment strategy with a focus in the blockchain space.
