The transaction is expected to close during the third quarter. \nGE Healthcare, which provides software and other tools for things like medical-records and image management as well as human-resource and payroll services, is the $19 billion health-care business of GE. The company built up the business through a series of acquisitions including its $1.2 billion purchase of IDX Systems Corp. in 2006. ",
