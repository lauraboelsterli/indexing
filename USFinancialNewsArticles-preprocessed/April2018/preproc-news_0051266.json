(NYSE: HLF) today announced its name change to “Herbalife Nutrition Ltd.”, as approved by shareholders at its annual general meeting of shareholders. The evolution of the Company’s name reflects the investments Herbalife Nutrition has made to become a leader in the nutrition industry, and its commitment to making the world healthier and happier.\n“More than ever before, consumers give our distributors permission to be their partner in seeking better nutrition and a more healthy and active lifestyle. Our new name, Herbalife Nutrition, reflects our strategic transformation as a leader in the nutrition industry,” said Rich Goudis, Herbalife Nutrition CEO.\nCommon shares of Herbalife Nutrition, which are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), will begin trading under the new name on April 25, 2018; the ticker symbol will remain “HLF”. In addition to the name change, shareholders also voted to approve a previously announced two-for-one stock split. The record date for the stock split is May 7, 2018 and the stock split distribution date is May 14, 2018. Common share certificates bearing the old Company name, \"Herbalife Ltd.\", continue to be valid, and shareholders are not required to exchange their existing common share certificates for new certificates bearing the new company name.\nThe Company now has more than 300 staff scientists and five state-of-the-art innovation and manufacturing facilities. Its Nutrition Advisory Board, Dietetic Advisory Board, and Fitness Advisory Board are comprised of leading experts in the fields of nutrition, health, and fitness. These advisors support distributor education and training, product development and innovation initiatives. The Herbalife Nutrition Institute also serves as an informational resource dedicated to promoting excellence in the field of nutrition.\nIn addition to offering customers quality nutrition products and a wide-ranging, customizable wellness program, Herbalife Nutrition also provides an economic opportunity to those interested in part-time or full-time work. The Company’s products are available exclusively through a global network of dedicated independent distributors who provide a unique one-on-one, high-touch experience for their customers. This “Distributor Difference” is critically needed in the field of nutrition because of the complexity involved, and personalization essential to weight management due to the necessary behavior and lifestyle change required to live a more healthy and active life.\nAbout Herbalife Nutrition Ltd.:\nHerbalife Nutrition is a global nutrition company whose purpose is to make the world healthier and happier. The Company has been on a mission for nutrition - changing people's lives with great nutrition products and programs - since 1980. Together with our Herbalife Nutrition independent distributors, we are committed to providing solutions to the worldwide problems of poor nutrition and obesity, an aging population, skyrocketing public healthcare costs and a rise in entrepreneurs of all ages. Herbalife Nutrition offers high-quality, science-backed products, most of which are produced in Company-operated facilities, one-on-one coaching with an Herbalife Nutrition independent distributor, and a supportive community approach that inspires customers to embrace a healthier, more active lifestyle.\nHerbalife Nutrition’s targeted nutrition, weight-management, energy and fitness and personal care products are available exclusively to and through its independent distributors in more than 90 countries. Through its corporate social responsibility efforts, Herbalife Nutrition supports the Herbalife Family Foundation (HFF) and its Casa Herbalife programs to help bring good nutrition to children in need. Herbalife Nutrition is also proud to sponsor more than 190 world-class athletes, teams and events around the globe, including Cristiano Ronaldo, the LA Galaxy, and numerous Olympic teams.\nHerbalife Nutrition has over 8,000 employees worldwide, and its shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: HLF) with net sales of approximately $4.4 billion in 2017.
