Such forward looking statements usually include words such as \"expects,\" \"projects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"intends,\" \"estimates,\" \"strategy,\" \"plan,\" \"potential,\" \"possible\" and other similar expressions.\nProspective investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees for future performance and involve risks and uncertainties, and that actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. Important factors currently known to management that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements include significant fluctuations in interest rates, inflation, economic recession, significant changes in the federal and state legal and regulatory environment, significant underperformance in our portfolio of outstanding loans, and competition in our markets. Management believes that the assumptions underlying the Company's forward-looking statements are reasonable, but any of the assumptions could prove to be inaccurate. Investors are urged to carefully consider the risks described in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") from time to time, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, which are available at www.renasant.com and the SEC's website at www.sec.gov . The Company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results over time.\nContacts\nFor Media:\nFor Financials:\nJohn Oxford\nKevin Chapman\nFirst Vice President\nExecutive Vice President\nDirector of Marketing\nChief Financial Officer\n(662) 680-1219\n(662) 680-1450\njoxford@renasant.com\nkchapman@renasant.com\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/renasant-announces-2018-first-quarter-earnings-webcast-and-conference-call-information-300627666.html\nSOURCE Renasant Corporation",
