    "text": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen’s ( VOWG_p.DE ) premium brand Audi ( NSUG.DE ) aims to double sales in China over the coming six years, sales chief Bram Schot told Automobilwoche.\nFILE PHOTO: An Audi Q8 concept is shown during a workshop prior to Auto Guangzhou in Guangzhou, China November 16, 2017. REUTERS/Bobby Yip /File Photo “In 2023 we want to sell 1.2 million cars in China,” the German trade magazine Quote: d him as saying.\nAudi sold 597,000 vehicles in China, its biggest single market, last year.\nThe company last year resolved a dispute with dealers in China that could have disrupted the luxury carmaker’s business in the world’s biggest auto market.\nThe dispute stemmed from a long-term collaboration between Audi and SAIC Motor Corp ( 600104.SS ) that had riled Audi store operators in China, who among others sell Chinese-made vehicles as part of Audi’s existing joint venture with China’s FAW Corp [SASACJ.UL].\nSchot said Audi would continue to work with both SAIC and FAW.\nReporting by Maria Sheahan; editing by John Stonestreet\n ",
