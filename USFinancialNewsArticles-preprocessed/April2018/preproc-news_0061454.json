    "text": "DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Former United States Securities and Exchange Commission attorney Willie Briscoe is investigating potential claims against the Board of Directors of Northwest Bancorporation (“Northwest Bancorporation”) (OTC Pink: NBCT) concerning the merger with First Interstate BancSystem, Inc. (“First Interstate”) (NASDAQGS: FIBK). Under the terms of the agreement, Northwest Bancorporation shareholders will only receive 0.516 of First Interstate Class A common stock for each Northwest Bancorporation share held. Based on the closing price of First Interstate before the deal was announced, the consideration is valued at approximately $21.03 per share.\nIf you are an affected investor, and you want to learn more about the investigation or if you have information that you believe would be helpful to our investigation of the fairness of the proposed transaction, contact Willie Briscoe at The Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC via email at shareholders@thebriscoelawfirm.com or by calling (888) 809-2750. There is no cost or fee to you.\nThe investigation centers on whether Northwest Bancorporation’s Board of Directors is acting in the shareholders’ best interests, whether the board is properly negotiating a higher share price for the shareholders, and whether the board has employed an adequate process to review and act on the proposed transaction.\nThe Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC is a full-service business litigation and shareholder rights advocacy firm with more than 20 years of experience in complex litigation matters, including claims of investor and stockholder fraud, shareholder derivative suits, and securities class actions.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180430005907/en/\nThe Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC\nWillie Briscoe, 888-809-2750\nshareholders@thebriscoelawfirm.com\nSource: The Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC",
