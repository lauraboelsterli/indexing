Diaz struck out Omar Narvaez looking to end the game.\nThe Mariners’ bullpen tossed three perfect innings to hold the one-run lead.\nShields (1-3) allowed four runs on six hits with four strikeouts and four walks in six innings.\nSeattle heads to Cleveland to begin a four-game series with the first-place Indians on Thursday, the final stop of a road trip. Chicago is off to Kansas City to play the Royals five times in four days, with a doubleheader on Saturday.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
