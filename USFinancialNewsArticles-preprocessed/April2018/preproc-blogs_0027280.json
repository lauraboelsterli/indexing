All CFO Journal-produced content can be accessed without a subscription. \nWorkers assemble stuffed Elmo dolls for Hasbro in Kakinada, India, in 2015. The Wall Street Journal Good morning. New public-company disclosure rules tracking employee pay are underscoring the incentive behind supplanting domestic manufacturing with global supply chains, writes the WSJ’s Theo Francis. U.S. toy manufacturers Hasbro Inc. and Mattel Inc. serve as an example for that.\nHasbro, which sells Transformers, as well as Star Wars and My Little Pony figures, paid a typical worker about $74,000 last year. Meanwhile, for Mattel — maker of American Girl dolls, Ghostbusters action figures and Barbies — the figure was closer to $6,300.\nThe numbers for Hasbro and Mattel highlight two distinct business models, at least for now. More than three-quarters of the 35,280 people who work for Mattel are employed outside the U.S. Most work in manufacturing plants, many of them in low-wage regions in Asia, including China. Mattel said in its proxy filing that its median employee is a factory worker in Malaysia.\nBy contrast, Hasbro, which is based in Pawtucket, R.I., said it employed about 5,400 people on Dec. 31, or not quite a sixth of Mattel’s head count. A little more than half worked in the U.S. Hasbro makes little itself and therefore doesn’t own the factories that make its toys and doesn’t employ the workers operating those factories, even if it pays them indirectly through its contract manufacturers. That means the lower-wage factory employees don’t pull Hasbro’s median wage down.\nTHE DAY AHEAD \nJPMorgan Chase & Co. , Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. are among the companies slated to report earnings today.\nCFO JOURNAL EXCLUSIVE \nBrexit dampens job market in the City of London. Uncertainty around the U.K.’s exit from the European Union is continuing to dampen hiring in the City of London, the heart of the U.K.’s banking industry, writes CFO Journal’s Nina Trentmann.\nThe number of available jobs in the banking & financial services sector declined by 14% to 5,145 in March compared to 5,985 in February and by 37% compared to the prior year month, according to the Morgan McKinley Employment Monitor.\nThe number of applicants seeking employment in the financial services industry decreased by 22% to 5,459 in March compared to February when 6,973 professionals were searching for a job in the sector. Year on year, the number of applicants declined by 44%, according to the study.\nCORPORATE NEWS \nHerbert Diess presents a new model at the Geneva Motor Show in Switzerland last month.

BlackRock Inc. pulled in nearly $57 billion in new investor cash in the first three months of the year, with its massive exchange-traded fund business attracting the bulk of that money.\nHearst takes full ownership of Fitch Group. Media conglomerate Hearst Corp. is becoming the sole owner of Fitch Group, buying the remaining 20% stake in the credit-ratings information provider for $2.8 billion.\nAmazon.com Inc.’s rivals fear they will lose out on Pentagon contract. The U.S. Defense Department will release a revised list of requirements in the coming days for a hotly contested, multibillion-dollar contract to move the Pentagon’s data into the cloud, and it says it won’t give in on a central demand: awarding the business to a single winner.\nLondon Stock Exchange appoints new CEO. London Stock Exchange Group PLC on Friday appointed a 20-year veteran of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as its new chief executive, filling a crucial leadership gap following the abrupt departure of former CEO Xavier Rolet.\nU.S. investors pile into fundraising round for Ant Financial. Investors outside China are helping to drive up the valuation of billionaire Jack Ma’s financial-technology business. U.S.-based private equity firms General Atlantic and Silver Lake Partners are planning to invest in Hangzhou-based Ant Financial Services Group , according to people familiar with the matter.\nWynn Resorts in early talks to sell casino project to MGM.

Bloomberg White House plans to escalate trade pressure on China. The Trump White House, confident that its hard-line strategy is succeeding, is planning to ratchet up the pressure on China by focusing on new tariffs and threatening to block Chinese technology investment in the U.S., according to officials familiar with the strategy.

Initial jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs across the U.S., decreased by 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 233,000 in the week ended April 7, the Labor Department said. This means claims have now held below 300,000 for 162 consecutive weeks, cementing the longest streak for weekly records dating back to 1967.\nCFO MOVES \nLennar Corp. , the Miami homebuilder, named Diane Bessette chief financial officer.

Previously she served as controller from 1997 to 2008. Compensation details were not immediately available.\nCisco Systems Inc., the San Francisco networking-gear maker, named Mark Garrett to its board of directors.
