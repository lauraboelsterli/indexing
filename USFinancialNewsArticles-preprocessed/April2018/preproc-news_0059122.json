    "text": "April 26, 2018 / 2:32 PM / Updated 28 minutes ago EU's Tusk tells Kosovo to improve relations with Serbia Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nPRISTINA (Reuters) - Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, urged Kosovo on Thursday to improve relations with Serbia in order to progress towards its long-term goal of European Union membership. European Union Council President Donald Tusk arrives to courtroom to testify as a witness in an investigation of the 2010 Smolensk plane crash that killed the former Polish president, Lech Kaczynski, and 95 others onboard, in Warsaw, Poland, April 23, 2018. Agencja Gazeta/Adam Stepien via REUTERS\nKosovo and five other Western Balkan nations seeking EU membership must all tackle corruption and organised crime, improve human rights and media freedoms and resolve any disputes with their neighbours before they can join.\nKosovo, a former Serbian province which is not recognised as an independent state by five current EU members or by Belgrade, is still far from membership talks. But it committed in 2013 along with Serbia to an EU-sponsored dialogue to improve ties.\nLittle progress has been made since then.\n“Without a comprehensive normalisation of relations with Serbia and full implementation of the agreements, I don’t see how a breakthrough in relations with the EU could be achieved,” Tusk told a joint news conference with Kosovo President Hashim Thaci.\n“I know it is going to be hard but I am still a cautious optimist and after yesterday’s meeting with (Serbian President) Aleksandar Vucic and today’s meeting with your president (Thaci) I am more optimistic and less cautious.”\nTusk, a former Polish prime minister, chairs summits of the 28-nation EU.\nKosovo declared independence from Belgrade 10 years ago, almost a decade after NATO bombed Serb forces to halt the killing and expulsion of ethnic Albanians from the region during a 1998-99 counter-insurgency war.\nKosovo has been recognised by 116 countries, including 23 of the 28 EU members.\nIts membership of the United Nations has been blocked by Serbia’s allies Russia and China.\nAround 120,000 Serbs who live in Kosovo still consider Belgrade their capital, and they are financially supported by Serbia.
