Our Company demonstrated 59% year-over-year growth in diluted earnings per share and achieved a 12.0% return on average common equity,” said Clayton G. Deutsch, CEO. “This quarter's performance reflects year-over-year pre-tax, pre-provision income growth of 23% with positive operating leverage achieved through strong revenue growth and expense growth in line with our expectations. We have worked hard to return to positive operating leverage following stepped up investments in staff and technology throughout 2017.”\n“The bank continues to exhibit strong credit quality in the form of lower Criticized and Classified loans, and our market-linked fee businesses achieved positive net flows on a consolidated basis amid increasing market volatility. Additionally, we announced that on April 13, we successfully completed the sale of our ownership interest in Anchor.”\nNet Interest Income and Margin (non-GAAP, except for Net Interest Income) % Change ($ in millions) 1Q18 4Q17 1Q17 Linked\nQuarter Year over\nYear Net interest income $57.4 $57.3 $53.6 — % 7 % Add: FTE adjustment 1.0 2.9 2.8 (66 )% (65 )% Net interest income, FTE basis 58.4 60.1 56.5 (3 )% 3 % Less: Interest recovered on previous nonaccrual loans 0.1 0.4 0.3 (81 )% (73 )% Core net interest income, FTE basis $58.3 $59.7 $56.2 (2 )% 4 % Net interest margin (FTE basis) 2.95 % 3.04 % 2.94 % Core net interest margin (FTE basis) 2.94 % 3.02 % 2.92 % Core net interest margin (non-FTE basis) 2.90 % 2.87 % 2.78 % Net interest income for the first quarter was $57.4 million, flat linked quarter, and an increase of 7% year-over-year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher yields on interest-earning assets, and higher asset volumes, partially offset by higher costs of deposits and borrowing volumes. The Company’s Core net interest margin (non-FTE basis) increased 3 basis points linked quarter to 2.90% driven primarily by higher asset yields and a mix shift from investments to loans, partially offset by increased deposit and borrowing costs.\nNet interest margin (FTE basis) was 2.95% for the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of 9 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase of 1 basis point from the first quarter of 2017.

The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher levels of assets under management in the Investment Management, Wealth Advisory, and Wealth Management and Trust segments. Investment management fees declined on a linked quarter basis primarily driven by $0.9 million of performance fees received in the fourth quarter. Private banking fees increased on a year-over-year basis due to increases in BOLI income.\nAssets Under Management % Change ($ in millions) 1Q18 4Q17 1Q17 Linked\nQuarter Year over\nYear Wealth Management and Trust $7,831 $7,865 $7,260 — % 8 % Investment Management 3 1,920 2,004 1,849 (4 )% 4 % Wealth Advisory 11,446 11,350 10,579 1 % 8 % Total assets under management 3 4 $21,186 $21,208 $19,677 — % 8 % Net flows 1Q18 4Q17 1Q17 Wealth Management and Trust $77 $79 $34 Investment Management 3 (15) 20 30 Wealth Advisory 136 29 263 Total net flows 3 $198 $128 $327 3 Information excludes Anchor\n4 Segments do not sum to Total assets under management due to $11 million intercompany relationship\nTotal assets under management, excluding Anchor, were $21.2 billion at the end of the first quarter, flat linked quarter and an increase of 8% year-over-year.

Salaries and employee benefits expense increased 8% linked quarter primarily driven by seasonal payroll expenses. The year-over-year increase in Salaries and employee benefits in the first quarter is primarily driven by incentive compensation and merit increases partially offset by a decrease in vacation accruals. Information systems expense increased 4% linked quarter and 9% year-over-year due to information technology investments. Amortization of intangible expense decreased 43% linked quarter primarily as a result of classifying Anchor as held for sale.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe effective tax rate for continuing operations (excluding non-GAAP adjustments) for the first quarter decreased to 21.5% from 30.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 30.7% in the first quarter of 2017.

(the “Company”) announced an agreement, effective December 19, 2017, to sell all of its current equity interest in Anchor Capital Advisors LLC, an indirect, majority-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Anchor”), to the management team of Anchor for an upfront cash payment and a non-voting, revenue share participation interest in Anchor. On April 13, 2018, the Company completed the sale of its ownership interest in Anchor. Anchor’s results remain consolidated in the Company’s results during current and prior periods. For presentation purposes, Anchor’s AUM are excluded from current and prior period AUM amounts, but are included in the calculation of Core Fees and Income. The Company classified the assets and liabilities of Anchor as held for sale at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, which are included with Other assets and Other liabilities, respectively, on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. For regulatory purposes, the goodwill and intangible assets of Anchor will be included in consolidated calculations. See footnotes 6 and 8, below.\n(2) Total revenue is the sum of Net interest income, Total core fees and income, and Total other income.\n(3) Net income from discontinued operations consists of contingent payments net of expenses related to our divested affiliate, Westfield Capital Management Company, LLC. The Company received its final contingent payment in the first quarter of 2018 related to this affiliate.\n(4) Adjustments to net income attributable to the Company to arrive at net income attributable to the common shareholders, as presented in these tables, include decrease/ (increase) in noncontrolling interests redemption value and dividends paid on preferred stock.\n(5) When the Company has positive net income from continuing operations attributable to the common shareholders, the Company adds additional shares to basic weighted average shares outstanding to arrive at diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the diluted earnings per share calculation. These additional shares reflect the assumed exercise, conversion, or contingent issuance of dilutive securities. If the additional shares would result in anti-dilution they would be excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation.
