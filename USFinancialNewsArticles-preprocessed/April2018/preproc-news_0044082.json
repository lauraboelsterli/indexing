    "text": "April 20, 2018 / 9:30 AM / Updated 4 hours ago Watford v Crystal Palace - Fans' view Clare Bloomfield 4 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - Crystal Palace travel to Vicarage Road on Saturday knowing that a victory over Watford will see them move a step closer to ensuring their Premier League status. \nRoy Hodgson’s side currently sit six points clear of the relegation zone with four games remaining. Meanwhile, Watford are without a win in their last five outings and will be eager to rediscover their form. \nHere is what the fans have to say about their respective clubs: \nMike Parkin, co-host, From The Rookery End \n“Watford’s recent history against Crystal Palace is less than impressive. The Selhurst Park side have had the measure of us in a number of key battles and they will fancy their chances of picking up a valuable three points against us this weekend. \n“Wilfried Zaha has given the Watford defence nightmares in virtually all of our previous encounters so we must find a way to stop him if we are to avoid yet another disappointing result. \n“Palace need points more than Watford so there is it’s likely that they will be under more pressure. We have conceded costly late goals in each of the last three games and the home crowd will want to see any lingering relegation fears banished once and for all. Both teams will be nervy, so I’ll go for a mistake-ridden 2-2 draw. \n“Watford have an inability to see games through. We have lost an incredible number of points from winning positions, and it’s not been helped by the ever changing and seemingly unreliable back line. Our Achilles’ heel is defending set pieces. All too often Watford have been undone by simple free kick routines and this has to be addressed. \n“It’s impossible not to feel a little disappointed this season given the start we made under Marco Silva. After beating Arsenal in one of the most memorable games of the season, Watford were up to fourth in the table and playing some scintillating football. But Silva became distracted by Everton and our season never recovered.” \nDominic Burrell, contributor, Read Crystal Palace \n“Everyone is on a high after Crystal Palaces’ brilliant win against our rivals Brighton last Saturday. We played really well in the first half and although we struggled in the second half, we finally managed to hold on to a result — something we haven’t been able to do much recently. \n“I am hopeful that we’ll be able see ourselves to safety with another win, so I am predicting a 2-1 victory. Watford are struggling and Wilfried Zaha often comes up with the goods against them, so I expect him to be influential at Vicarage Road again on Saturday. \n“We probably only need two or three more points so I’m fairly confident that we can avoid the drop. There are no easy games but we have certainly got the kindest run of fixtures until the end of the season. That combined with the way we are playing should see us through. \n“Our defence has looked very fragile recently and Troy Deeney is always a handful. Watford are a good side and they proved this during the first half of the season. My only hope is that they don’t rediscover their form on Saturday. \n“This season has been a bit of a disaster from start to finish. From Frank De Boer’s ineptitude, our inability to sign the players in the positions we needed and a multitude of injuries. Despite that, Roy Hodgson has done his best to steer the ship towards safety and I hope we can build on this next season. Keeping Zaha is a must.” Editing by John O'Brien",
