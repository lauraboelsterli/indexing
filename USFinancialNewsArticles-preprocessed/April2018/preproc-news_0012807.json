    "text": "April 6, 2018 / 2:10 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Flawless white diamonds, among largest ever offered, to go on sale Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - Two flawless white diamonds each weighing in at more than 50 carats are expected to fetch more than $15 million (10.65 million pounds) when they are auctioned in May, auctioneers Sotheby’s Diamonds said on Friday. A model poses with two white diamonds, each over 50 carats, at Sotheby's auction house in London, Britain, April 6, 2018. REUTERS/Henry Nicholls \nThe diamonds, a 51.71 carat round brilliant-cut gemstone and a 50.39 carat oval, are the second-largest of their respective kinds ever to come to auction, Sotheby’s said. \nThe sale of the gemstones, discovered and purchased at tender in Botswana, comes after a 102 carat white diamond sold to an undisclosed buyer in February far exceeded the price paid per carat for any colourless diamond at auction, according to auctioneers, who did not reveal the price paid.
