    "text": "Do You Like That Stock, or Do You Just Love its Ticker? The Wall Street Journal. 4/13/2018 Jason Zweig © Christophe Vorlet Just about every investor wants safety, income and growth.\n\"> A small real-estate investment trust -- Safety, Income & Growth Inc. -- claims to offer exactly that. Its ticker symbol? SAFE.\nYet investing nirvana is never within easy reach, and financial labels don’t always mean exactly what they say.\nSAFE buys the land beneath a building and then leases it to the operators or tenants of that property. It ends up with an asset that should increase in value and a stream of steady income expected to rise over time.\nSAFE has a total market value of only about $300 million. The company lost $1.8 million on $23 million in revenue last year. Its two largest tenants accounted for roughly 68% of its total revenues.\nNone of that means that investing in SAFE is a terrible idea. Every big company once was small, and early losses are common and SAFE says its revenues should grow more diversified as time passes.\nBut if, as many investors do, you define “safe” as “I can’t lose any money on this thing,” then SAFE has so far been a little risky.\nThe company sold shares to the public for the first time last June. It has lost nearly 9% since then, slightly worse than the Vanguard REIT Index ETF, a fund that reflects the performance of real-estate securities as a whole. Meanwhile the S&P 500 index of U.S. stocks gained 10%.\nChief Executive Jay Sugarman, a veteran real-estate manager, says the name came to him a couple of years ago.\n“What the world needs right now is something very tangible,” he recalls saying: “Safety of principal, income and income growth, and the chance for big capital appreciation. Why try to find a new name? Let’s just name it exactly what it does: safety, income and growth.”\nThe success of SAFE’s approach will take time to prove itself, says Mr. Sugarman. He predicts the company will “create significant value for shareholders in the long run, and that’s what we should be judged on.”\nFair enough: The long run is exactly what should matter in the stock market. Investors do have short attention spans, however, and “your ticker symbol is a free opportunity to tell your story and set yourself apart from the crowd,” says Mr. Sugarman.\nShould regulators pass judgment on whether a name like “Safety, Income & Growth Inc.” or a ticker symbol like SAFE might lead some investors to believe that they can’t lose money? Perhaps, but they don’t.\nUnder a Securities and Exchange Commission rule, mutual funds can’t have names that are misleading. So investment companies don’t sell their wares under names like the Get Rich Quick Fund or the Beat the Market to a Pulp Portfolio.\nREITs and other companies -- not to mention cryptocurrencies -- are generally free to name themselves as they see fit. They can also pick pretty much any ticker symbol they like.\nTicker symbols began a century-and-a-half ago to feed the ticker machines, invented in 1867 and perfected by Thomas Edison, that transmitted market prices. To prevent the stream of prices on the paper ticker tape from falling too far behind in reporting the trades, the ticker operators abbreviated stock names with a few letters.\nOriginally, single-letter tickers were the most prestigious. Now, ETFs want tickers that spell out an evocative word. Many such tickers are harmlessly amusing, like WOOD (the iShares Global Timber & Forestry ETF ) or MOO (VanEck Vectors Agribusiness ETF).\nOthers, though, might seem to imply safety or durability, such as AOK (iShares iShares Core Conservative Allocation ETF) or MINT (Pimco Enhanced Short Maturity Active ETF).\nAOK, originally launched in 2008 under a different name and ticker, was redesigned in 2015 as part of a group of four funds. The other three funds’ new tickers all began with the letters AO, but AOC (for Conservative) wasn’t available at the time, so the firm chose AOK instead, says a spokeswoman for BlackRock Inc., which runs iShares.\nA spokesman for Pimco declined to comment.\nAlthough obscene four-letter words can’t be used as tickers, stock exchanges generally don’t impose other limits, and the SEC and other regulators don’t police tickers.\nYears ago, meeting with one of the largest asset-management firms in Europe, I discussed some research on how investors may be overly attracted to companies with familiar-sounding names or tickers. The firm’s chief investment officer suddenly blanched. He had just realized that one of his favorite holdings had the same ticker as the firm’s own initials.\nNo matter how much you like a business or have studied a strategy, a catchy name or ticker can still sway you.\nSo, after you’ve done the homework, reframe the problem: Change a company’s name with words like Danger or Risk. Transform a positive ticker to PAIN or LOSS. If you still like it after that, buy it.\nWrite to Jason Zweig at intelligentinvestor@wsj.com, and follow him on Twitter at @jasonzweigwsj.\n",
