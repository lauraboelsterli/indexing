    "text": "April 6, 2018 / 12:46 AM / Updated 2 hours ago PRECIOUS-Gold rises after Trump proposes more tariffs on China Reuters Staff 3 Min Read April 6 (Reuters) - Gold prices rose on Friday as investors sought safer assets after U.S. President Donald Trump proposed $100 billion in new tariffs on China, raising concerns about an escalating trade spat between the United States and China. FUNDAMENTALS * Spot gold was 0.4 percent higher at $1,330.78 per ounce as of 0032 GMT, and the U.S. gold futures rose 0.4 percent to $1,334.10 an ounce. * Spot gold on Thursday dropped to a one-week low of $1,322.40 an ounce after the United States and China signalled willingness to negotiate a trade dispute. * However, President Donald Trump late on Thursday said he had instructed U.S. trade officials to consider $100 billion in additional tariffs on China, fuelling an already heated trade dispute between the world's two biggest economies. * U.S. stock markets slid and the yen rose against the dollar on Friday. * Gold-backed exchange traded funds in North America saw inflows in March, amid market volatility and as trade tensions between the United States and China drove safe-haven purchases to bullion, while Europe saw outflows for the second straight month. * Holdings of SPDR Gold Trust , the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, rose 0.24 percent to 854.09 tonnes on Thursday from 852.03 tonnes on Wednesday. * Physical gold demand in most Asian hubs was muted this week, weighed down by stronger prices, despite a slight pick-up in buying in India ahead of the wedding season and a key festival. * The U.S. trade deficit increased to a near 9-1/2-year high in February, with both imports and exports rising to record highs in a sign of strong domestic and global demand. * Koza Ltd, whose founder had to abandon his Turkish gold assets, is expanding its operations in Britain with a $1 million programme to drill for gold in Ayrshire, Scotland, together with a venture partner, the company said on Thursday. * Swiss refiner Valcambi said it has signed a long-term deal to refine and sell-on gold from a Fairtrade-accredited concession of Peruvian mining co-operative Minera Limata, part of a broader strategy to drive responsible mining. * International mining companies have insisted that Democratic Republic of Congo amend portions of a new mining code to respect exemptions they were granted by its predecessor.
