    "text": "April 10, 2018 / 2:07 PM / Updated 12 minutes ago CANADA STOCKS-TSX edges higher as energy stocks gain, trade war worries ebb Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nApril 10 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index rose on Tuesday as higher oil prices lifted energy shares and trade war worries receded after Chinese President Xi Jinping promised to cut import tariffs. \n* At 9:37 a.m. ET (1337 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX Composite Index rose 86.77 points, or 0.57 percent, to 15,314.47. Eight of the index’s 10 main sectors were higher. \n* Xi said on Tuesday China would raise the foreign ownership limit in the automobile sector “as soon as possible” and push previously announced measures to open the financial sector. \n* The price of oil, one of Canada’s major exports, broke above $70 a barrel as trade war worries ebbed. Brent crude futures were up $1.53 at $70.18. \n* The energy sector advanced 1.5 percent and financial sector rose half a percentage point. Together, the two sectors account for more than half the weight of TSX. \n* Shares of oil producers Suncor Energy, Enbridge Inc and Canadian Natural Resources rose nearly a percent each, lifting the energy sector. \n* Kinder Morgan Canada rose about 2 percent after the Canadian government said it was considering all options to ensure construction goes ahead on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. \n* Lundin Mining, which rose 4.2 percent, was the largest percentage gainer on the TSX, while Aurora Cannabis fell 4.2 percent and was the biggest decliner. \n* Neovasc Inc, Aurora Cannabis and Canopy Growth Co were among the most active Canadian stocks by volume. \n* Volume on the TSX index was 10.61 million shares, while the total volume on Tuesday was 22.92 million shares. \n* Across all Canadian issues there were no new 52-week highs and one new low. \n* Canadian housing starts slowed slightly in March and building permits dipped in February, but overall residential construction activity remained strong, latest reports showed on Tuesday.
