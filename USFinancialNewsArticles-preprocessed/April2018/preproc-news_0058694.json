    "text": "- AFFO per Certificate Increases 3.2% YoY -\n- Increases quarterly distribution per Certificate by 4.0% -\nMEXICO CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- FIBRA Macquarie México (FIBRAMQ) (BMV: FIBRAMQ), owner of one of the largest portfolios of industrial and retail property in Mexico, announced its financial and operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 HIGHLIGHTS\nIncrease in AFFO per certificate of 3.2% YoY to Ps 0.6020, a record since inception Average industrial and retail rental rates increased 2.6% and 5.3% YoY respectively Increase in quarterly AFFO margin of 160 basis points YoY Authorization of a quarterly cash distribution of Ps 0.39 per certificate, a 4% increase over the prior quarter\nMANAGEMENT COMMENTARY\n“In the first quarter of 2018 we continued the momentum we established last year. With a continued focus on real estate operations and leasing, prudent capital allocation, and optimizing our portfolio, we made progress on each of our key strategic priorities,” said Juan Monroy, FIBRA Macquarie’s chief executive officer. “Although FX movements impacted our year-over-year NOI comparison, the strength of our platform and real estate team allowed us to produce a solid quarter of earnings growth and margin improvements. We also continue to accretively reinvest our retained AFFO in both certificate buybacks and expansions, and we maintain an attractive pipeline of additional potential expansions. We intend to pursue opportunistic asset recycling sales, as we seek to both enhance the composition of our portfolio and reinvest the proceeds into value creating opportunities. As the year progresses, we maintain confidence in our portfolio, strategy and outlook.”\nFINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS\nConsolidated Portfolio\nFIBRAMQ’s total results were as follows:\nTOTAL PORTFOLIO 1Q18 1Q17 Variance Net Operating Income (NOI) Ps 824.7m Ps 838.8m -1.7 % EBITDA Ps 767.8m Ps 778.8m -1.4 % Funds From Operations (FFO) Ps 546.9m Ps 549.9m -0.5 % FFO per certificate Ps 0.6890 Ps 0.6778 1.7 % Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) Ps 477.8m Ps 473.2m 1.0 % AFFO per certificate Ps 0.6020 Ps 0.5832 3.2 % NOI Margin 87.6 % 87.2 % 43 bps AFFO Margin 50.8 % 49.2 % 158 bps GLA (’000s sqm) EOP 3,428 3,433 -0.1 % Occupancy EOP 92.2 % 92.7 % -53 bps Average Occupancy 92.2 % 92.7 % -51 bps FIBRAMQ’s same store portfolio results were as follows:\nTOTAL PORTFOLIO - SAME STORE 1Q18 1Q17 Variance Net Operating Income (NOI) Ps 825.2m Ps 825.3m 0.0 % GLA (’000s sqm) EOP 3,414 3,377 1.1 % Occupancy EOP 92.3 % 92.9 % -52 bps Industrial Retention (LTM) 84 % 66 % 1,859 bps Weighted Avg Lease Term Remaining (years) EOP 3.55 3.76 -5.5 % Industrial Portfolio\nThe following table summarizes the results for FIBRAMQ’s industrial portfolio:\nINDUSTRIAL PORTFOLIO 1Q18 1Q17 Variance Net Operating Income (NOI) Ps 683.0m Ps 705.0m -3.1 % NOI Margin 91.4 % 90.3 % 112 bps GLA (’000s sqft) EOP 31,991 32,050 -0.2 % GLA (’000s sqm) EOP 2,972 2,978 -0.2 % Occupancy EOP 91.9 % 92.3 % -46 bps Average Occupancy 91.9 % 92.4 % -54 bps Average monthly rent per leased (US$/sqm) EOP $ 4.67 $ 4.55 2.6 % Customer retention LTM 85 % 66 % 1,910 bps Weighted Avg Lease Term Remaining (years) EOP 3.2 3.2 1.4 % For the three months ended March 31, 2018, FIBRAMQ’s industrial portfolio delivered net operating income (NOI) of Ps 683.0 million, compared to Ps 705.0 million in the prior comparable period. The year-over-year decline in NOI was primarily due to appreciation of the Peso relative to the US Dollar.\nRental rates improved compared to the same quarter last year, with a closing weighted average of US$4.67 per leased square meter per month, a 2.6% increase. This rate increase was driven primarily by contractual increases, along with positive renewal spreads. The industrial portfolio occupancy rate as of March 31, 2018 was 91.9%. The 50 basis points decrease in closing occupancy compared to the prior year was due to a moderate leasing quarter combined with some tenant specific move-outs.\nFIBRAMQ signed 19 new and renewal leases in the first quarter of 2018, comprising 1.0 million square feet. Signed leases included six new leases totaling 289 thousand square feet and 13 renewal leases totaling 745 thousand square feet. New leases included two new expansions.\nNotable new leases in the quarter include a manufacturer of materials samples in Tijuana and a contract manufacturer in Ciudad Juárez. Renewal activity was diversified across various geographies and customer types, including manufacturers of consumer packaging, water technology equipment and automotive parts.\nFor the twelve-month period ending March 31, 2018, FIBRAMQ achieved a retention rate of 85%, showing ongoing improvement from the prior year comparable period. For the remainder of 2018, FIBRAMQ is facing a slightly elevated lease expiration schedule and a tempered leasing environment given the lingering macroeconomic backdrop and upcoming Mexican elections.\nRetail Portfolio\nThe following table summarizes the proportionally combined results of operations for FIBRAMQ’s retail portfolio:\nRETAIL PORTFOLIO 1Q18 1Q17 Variance Net Operating Income (NOI) Ps 141.7m Ps 133.8m 5.9 % NOI Margin 73.1 % 73.9 % -81 bps GLA (’000s sqm) EOP 456 455 0.1 % Occupancy EOP 94.5 % 95.2 % -70 bps Average Occupancy 94.6 % 95.0 % -35 bps Average monthly rent per leased (Ps/sqm) EOP Ps 152.51 Ps 144.85 5.3 % Customer retention LTM 67 % 65 % 182 Weighted Avg Lease Term Remaining (years) EOP 4.7 5.2 -9.5 % FIBRAMQ’s retail portfolio delivered NOI of Ps 141.7 million, an increase of 5.9% from the prior year period. Year-over-year growth was driven by a 5.3% increase in average monthly rents and an increase in parking income. During the first quarter, FIBRAMQ signed 57 leases, representing 8.4 thousand square meters. This activity included 20 new leases and 37 renewals.\nPORTFOLIO AND EXPANSION ACTIVITY\nFIBRAMQ continues to effectively execute its strategy to deploy retained AFFO into accretive investments. A key element of this strategy is the targeted expansion of existing properties on a pre-leased basis along with selective development in core markets. During the first quarter of 2018, FIBRAMQ deployed or committed to deploy US$5.7 million.\nDuring the first quarter, FIBRAMQ completed the following expansion projects:\nA 37 thousand square foot expansion for a food and beverage manufacturer in Guadalajara, which includes an option to for a second expansion of 27 thousand square foot A 14 thousand square foot expansion for a manufacturer of irrigation systems in Queretaro.\nFIBRAMQ commenced a 59 thousand square foot expansion for a manufacturer of beauty, personal care and pharmaceutical goods in Reynosa.\nASSET RECYCLING PROGRAM\nFIBRAMQ remains committed to owning a best-in-class portfolio by continuing to enhance its property composition through asset recycling opportunities, and continues to pursue both single asset and portfolio sales in its industrial portfolio.\nBALANCE SHEET AND CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITY\nAs of March 31, 2018, FIBRAMQ had approximately Ps 16.1 billion of debt outstanding, Ps 4.1 billion available on its undrawn revolving credit facility and Ps 370.7 million of unrestricted cash on hand. FIBRAMQ’s CNBV regulatory debt to total asset ratio was 35.8%. The percentage of fixed-rate to variable-rate debt is 95% with a weighted-average debt tenor remaining of approximately 5.7 years. FIBRAMQ maintains sufficient liquidity and flexibility, and has no scheduled debt expirations for the remainder of 2018.\nCAPITAL ALLOCATION\nThe following table provides an overview of how FIBRA Macquarie has funded and deployed its cash to execute on its previously stated initiatives to maximize value to its certificate holders. FIBRA Macquarie remains committed to utilizing retained AFFO and proceeds from non-core asset sales to deploy capital across property expansions and developments, certificates re-purchased for cancellation and repayment of revolving debt.\nCAPITAL SOURCES AND ALLOCATIONS – FY2017/YTD2018 Ps equivalent US$ equivalent Capital sources Retained AFFO – FY2017/1Q18 790.0m 41.8m Asset Sales – FY2017/1Q18 525.1m 28.3m Utilization of surplus cash 449.6m 23.2m Capital sources - total 1,764.7m 93.3m Capital allocations Expansions & Developments – FY2017/1Q18 442.5m 23.4m Certificates re-purchased for cancellation – FY2017/1Q18 412.2m 21.9m Debt repayment – FY2017/1Q18 832.9m 44.0m Other – FY2017/1Q18 77.2m 4.1m Capital allocations - total 1,764.7m 93.3m Note: Uses average FX for the corresponding period. “Other” includes income-generating Above-Standard Tenant Improvements of US$1.2m in 2017 and US$0.4m in 1Q 2018.\nFor additional information, please refer to page eight of the First Quarter 2018 Supplementary Information materials located at www.fibramacquarie.com/investors/bolsa-mexicana-de-valores-filings .\nCERTIFICATE BUY-BACK AND CANCELLATION PROGRAM\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, FIBRAMQ continued executing on its certificate buyback program as it believes it generates highly accretive returns as the certificates continue to trade at a discount to NAV.\nCERTIFICATE REPURCHASES Number Amount First Quarter 2018 7.7m Ps 161.5m Since program commencement 19.1m Ps 412.2m Remaining 21.4m All repurchased certificates have been cancelled or will be cancelled in due course. FIBRAMQ is authorized to repurchase up to 5.0% of outstanding certificates. The timing, price per certificate and amount of future repurchases will depend upon prevailing market prices, trading windows, general economic and market conditions and other considerations, including investment alternatives.\nDaily updates of FIBRAMQ’s buyback activity can be found at http://www.bmv.com.mx/en/issuers/corporativeinformation/FIBRAMQ-30024-CGEN_CAPIT .\nDISTRIBUTION\nOn April 26, 2018, FIBRAMQ declared a cash distribution for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 of Ps 0.39 per certificate. This distribution represents a 4.0% increase from the prior quarter dividend and will be considered a return of capital for Mexican tax purposes.\nThe distribution is expected to be paid on May 10, 2018 to holders of record on May 9, 2018. FIBRAMQ’s certificates will commence trading ex-distribution on May 8, 2018.\n2018 GUIDANCE\nFIBRA Macquarie is reiterating its guidance for 2018. FIBRAMQ estimates total AFFO of between Ps. 2.25 and Ps. 2.30 per certificate in 2018. In respect of the full year 2018, FIBRAMQ expects to make cash distributions of approximately Ps 1.56 per certificate, payable in quarterly distributions of Ps. 0.39 per certificate.\nThis guidance is based on the following assumptions:\nBased on the cash-generating capacity of its existing portfolio and an average exchange rate of Ps 18.5 per US dollar for the remainder of the year Assumes no new acquisitions Notwithstanding that FIBRAMQ has an active asset recycling program, assumes no divestments, provided that successful execution of opportunistic asset sales may result in a temporary decrease in AFFO until proceeds are re-deployed in other accretive opportunities Re-purchase for cancellation in 2018 of the remaining 21.4 million certificates available for buyback, resulting in an aggregate 5.0% of issued certificates being re-purchased and cancelled, to close 2018 with 770.8 million certificates outstanding The payment of cash distributions is subject to the approval of the board of directors of the Manager The continued stable performance of the properties in the portfolio, and market conditions.\nBased upon the mid-point of our 2018 guidance and closing certificate price as of April 26, 2018 of Ps 18.89, the current implied AFFO yield is 12.0% and distribution yield is 8.3%.\nWEBCAST AND CONFERENCE CALL\nFIBRAMQ will host an earnings conference call and webcast presentation on Friday, April 27, 2018 at 7:30 a.m. CT / 8:30 a.m. ET.
