    "text": "April 19, 2018 / 1:13 AM / Updated 36 minutes ago Bullet point previews of Premier League matches Reuters Staff 5 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Match-by-match facts and statistics ahead of the Premier League fixtures on April 21-23 (All kickoff times in GMT): \nSaturday, April 21 \nWest Bromwich Albion v Liverpool (1130) \n*Liverpool are unbeaten in last nine Premier League meetings with West Brom (four wins, five draws), with the reverse fixture at Anfield ending 0-0 in December. \n*Mohamed Salah is one goal away from Luis Suarez’s 31-goal season tally in 2013-14, the most by a Liverpool player in a single Premier League campaign. \n*Caretaker boss Darren Moore has equalled Alan Pardew’s total Premier League wins (one in 18 games) as West Brom manager in only his second game in charge with a win at Manchester United last weekend. \n*Liverpool striker Roberto Firmino has contributed with two goals and two assists in his last four appearances against West Brom in all competitions. \n*West Brom are at the bottom of the standings and nine points from safety with four matches remaining, while Liverpool sit third. \nWatford v Crystal Palace (1400) \n*Watford are winless in their last six home matches in all competitions since a 2-0 Championship victory in 2009. \n*Roy Hodgson’s Crystal Palace won the reverse fixture 2-1 at Selhurst Park in December despite trailing from the third to the 89th minute of the match. \n*Watford have lost four league matches this season courtesy goals conceded in the 90th minute of later, including their 1-0 loss to Huddersfield Town last weekend. \n*Wilfried Zaha’s brace against Brighton and Hove Albion last weekend made him only the third player to reach 20 Premier League goals for Palace, following Chris Armstrong (23) and Andrew Johnson (21). \n*Palace have kept just one clean sheet in their last 11 league games, a 2-0 win over Huddersfield last month. \nSunday, April 22 \nArsenal v West Ham United (1230) \n*Arsene Wenger’s Arsenal have lost just one of their last 19 Premier League matches with West ham, a 2-0 defeat at the Emirates in Aug. 2015. \n*Mesut Ozil has scored five goals and made two assists in his last four Premier League appearance against West Ham. \n*Arsenal’s January signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has scored six time and assisted twice in his opening eight Premier League matches for Arsenal. \n*West Ham have drawn all three of their away London derbies - against Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Crystal Palace - in the league this season. \n*David Moyes’ West Ham are 14th in the league and seven points clear of the relegation zone with five matches remaining. \nStoke City v Burnley (1230) \n*Burnley are looking to secure a first league double over Stoke since the 2002-03 campaign, having defeated the Potters 1-0 last December. \n*Following West Brom’s win at Manchester United last weekend, Stoke are now on the longest current winless run in the Premier League (10 games). \n*Chris Wood has scored five away goals this season, the most by a Burnley player in a single Premier League campaign since Danny Ings’s six in 2014-15. \n*Seventh-placed Burnley have won their last three away league matches, while Stoke have suffered three consecutive defeats at home. \n*Relegation-threatened Stoke are second-bottom in the league and five points from safety with four matches to play. \nManchester City v Swansea City (1530) \n*Swansea have never won a match at the Etihad Stadium. \n*Swansea have beaten Man City once in the Premier League, when the Welsh side won 1-0 at the Liberty Stadium in 2012. \n*Since that defeat, the teams have met 12 times in all competitions, with Man City winning 10 and drawing twice. \n*Swansea, who are five points above the relegation zone, have one win, one defeat and three draws in their past five league matches. \n*Man City were crowned Premier League champions on Sunday with five games to play, equalling the English top-flight record of Manchester United (1907-08 and 2000-01) and Everton (1984-85). \nMonday, April 23 \nEverton v Newcastle United (1900) \n*Everton have won seven of their last eight league meetings with Liverpool, including the last four in a row. \n*Newcastle have won just one of their 13 Premier League trips to Goodison Park, winning 1-0 in Sept. 2010 courtesy a Hatem Ben Arfa goal. \n*Wayne Rooney has scored 15 Premier League goals against Newcastle, more than he has against any other opponent in the competition. \n*Rafa Benitez has guided Newcastle to four consecutive Premier League victories. The Spaniard last won five in a row in the competition with Liverpool in May 2009. \n*Newcastle’s Ayoze Perez has scored in three consecutive English league games for the first time since Nov. 2014.
