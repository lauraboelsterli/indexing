    "text": "April 3, 2018 / 2:51 PM / Updated 44 minutes ago Pfizer in talks with P&G for consumer health unit sale - CNBC Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc ( PFE.N ) is in talks with Procter & Gamble Co ( PG.N ) for a sale of the largest U.S. drugmakerâ€™s consumer health business, CNBC reported on Tuesday, citing sources. A logo of Pfizer is displayed on a monitor outside of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York, U.S., December 5, 2017. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson \nThe companies were far apart on a price for the business and Pfizer is considering other options, including a joint venture with other drugmakers, the report said. \nPfizer said it is evaluating potential strategic options for the unit and expects to make a decision in 2018. \nGlaxoSmithKline ( GSK.L ), Reckitt Benckiser ( RB.L ) and Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ) have all exited from the bidding process, endangering an auction Pfizer hoped would bring in as much as $20 billion \nP&G said it declined to comment.
