    "text": "LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pacific City Financial Corporation (the “Company”) (OTC Pink: PFCF), the holding company of Pacific City Bank (the “Bank”), today reported net income of $6.3 million, or $0.46 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $2.3 million, or $0.17 per diluted common share, in the previous quarter and $4.4 million, or $0.33 per diluted common share, in the year-ago quarter.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nNet income totaled $6.3 million or $0.46 per diluted common share; Total assets increased $137.0 million, or 9.5%, to $1,579.0 million at March 31, 2018 compared with $1,442.0 million at December 31, 2017; Total loans, including loans held-for-sale (“LHFS”) and net of unearned fees and costs, increased $34.2 million, or 2.9%, to $1,229.5 million at March 31, 2018 compared with $1,195.3 million at December 31, 2017; Total deposits increased $130.6 million, or 10.4%, to $1,381.9 million at March 31, 2018 compared with $1,251.3 million at December 31, 2017; Classified loans decreased $603,000, or 12.1%, to $4.4 million at March 31, 2018 compared with $5.0 million at December 31, 2017; and Net interest margin increased 6 bps to 4.33% for the first quarter of 2018 compared with 4.27% for the previous quarter and increased 18 bps compared with 4.15% for the year-ago quarter.\n\"We are pleased to report a strong quarter that was highlighted by the expansion in net interest margin and net interest income,” stated Henry Kim, President and CEO. “Our net interest margin increased to 4.33% in the first quarter of 2018 compared with 4.27% in the previous quarter and 4.15% in the year-ago quarter. Our net income in the first quarter of 2018 increased 168% to $6.3 million compared with $2.3 million in the previous quarter and increased 42.4% compared with $4.4 million in the year-ago quarter.”\nMr. Kim continued, “Our deposit balance increased $131 million, or 10.4%, to $1.38 billion in the first quarter of 2018 compared with $1.25 billion in the previous quarter and increased $236 million, or 20.6%, compared with $1.15 billion in the year-ago quarter. The anticipated rise in market interest rates will challenge our ability to manage cost of funds; however, our asset-sensitive balance sheet is expected to more than offset such rise in interest expenses and improve our net interest margin.”\n2018 First Quarter Financial Highlights (dollars in thousands, except per share data) At or for the Three Months Ended Mar. 31,\n2018\nDec. 31,\n2017\n%\nchange\nMar. 31,\n2017\n%\nchange\nNet income $ 6,264 $ 2,339 167.8 % $ 4,398 42.4 % Earnings per common share (diluted) 0.46 0.17 170.6 % 0.33 39.4 % Net interest income $ 15,293 $ 14,933 2.4 % $ 12,470 22.6 % Provision for loan loss 95 1,713 -94.5 % (198 ) -148.0 % Non-interest income 3,362 3,362 0.0 % 3,489 -3.6 % Non-interest expense 9,630 9,620 0.1 % 8,521 13.0 % Total assets $ 1,578,970 $ 1,441,998 9.5 % $ 1,286,432 22.7 % Net loans receivable, net of allowance and loan fee/cost 1,210,901 1,177,775 2.8 % 1,042,879 16.1 % Total deposits 1,381,925 1,251,289 10.4 % 1,146,262 20.6 % Return on average assets 1.73 % 0.65 % 1.42 % Return on average stockholders' equity 17.50 % 6.47 % 13.77 % Net interest margin 4.33 % 4.27 % 4.15 % Efficiency ratio 51.62 % 52.58 % 53.39 % Tangible common equity to tangible assets 9.32 % 9.86 % 10.21 % Tangible common equity per common share $ 10.97 $ 10.60 $ 9.79 Tier 1 leverage ratio (consolidated) 10.09 % 10.01 % 10.45 % RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Income\nNet income for the 2018 first quarter increased $3.9 million, or 167.8%, to $6.3 million compared with $2.3 million for the previous quarter and increased $1.9 million, or 42.4%, compared with $4.4 million for the year-ago quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 first quarter was $0.46 compared with $0.17 for the previous quarter and $0.33 for the year-ago quarter. The increase in net income compared with the previous quarter was primarily due to a decrease of $1.6 million in provision for loan losses, a decrease of $2.0 million in income tax provision, and an increase of $360,000 in net interest income. The increase in net income compared to the year-ago quarter was primarily due to an increase of $2.8 million in net interest income, a decrease of $572,000 in income tax provision, partially offset by an increase of $1.1 million in non-interest expense, and a decrease of $127,000 in non-interest income.\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income for the 2018 first quarter increased $360,000, or 2.4%, to $15.3 million compared with $14.9 million for the previous quarter and increased $2.8 million, or 22.6%, compared with $12.5 million for the year-ago quarter. The increase in net interest income compared with the previous quarter and the year-ago quarter was primarily due to an increase in interest-earning assets and a continuous increase in market interest rates since December 2016.\nInterest income on loans for the 2018 first quarter increased $608,000, or 3.6%, to $17.4 million compared with $16.8 million for the previous quarter and increased $3.6 million, or 25.7%, compared with $13.9 million for the year-ago quarter. The increase in interest income on loans compared with the previous quarter was primarily due to increases in loan balance and loan yield. The average total loan balance, including LHFS, was $1,219.9 million in the 2018 first quarter compared with $1,186.0 million in the previous quarter and $1,055.8 million in the year-ago quarter. Loan yield was 5.80% in the 2018 first quarter, 5.63% in the previous quarter, and 5.33% in the year-ago quarter.\nBelow is a table showing our fixed and variable interest rate loan mix accompanied by the weighted the average contractual rates as of dates indicated:\nMarch 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 % to Gross\nLoans *\nWAVG\nContractual\nRate\n% to Gross\nLoans *\nWAVG\nContractual\nRate\n% to Gross\nLoans *\nWAVG\nContractual\nRate\nFixed rate loans 26.8 % 5.07 % 26.6 % 5.09 % 29.3 % 5.11 % Variable rate loans 73.2 % 5.62 % 73.4 % 5.38 % 70.7 % 4.92 % * Includes LHFS of $6.2 million, $5.3 million, and $12.8 million at March, 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2017, respectively.\nInterest income on investment securities for the 2018 first quarter increased $76,000, or 9.8%, to $848,000 compared with $772,000 for the previous quarter and increased $340,000, or 66.9%, compared with $508,000 for the year-ago quarter. The increases compared with the previous quarter and the year-ago quarter were primarily due to an increase in the size of the investment securities portfolio and an improvement in yield resulting from additional purchases of investment securities in the current rising interest rate environment. The average balance of investment securities in the 2018 first quarter was $149.4 million, compared with $147.5 million in the previous quarter and $104.3 million in the year-ago quarter, and the yield in the 2018 first quarter was 2.27% compared with 2.09% in the previous quarter and 1.95% in the year-ago quarter.\nTotal interest expense for the 2018 fourth quarter increased $397,000, or 13.5%, to $3.3 million compared with $2.9 million for the previous quarter and increased $1.2 million, or 55.3%, compared with $2.1 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to increases in the balance of interest-bearing liabilities and cost of interest-bearing deposits that resulted from our deposit promotion during the 2018 first quarter. During the promotion, the Company raised $122.7 million of interest-bearing deposits at a weighted average rate of 2.21%. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities was $1,000.7 million in the 2018 first quarter compared with $948.3 million in the previous quarter, and $839.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 1.35% in the 2018 first quarter compared with 1.23% in the previous quarter, and 1.04% in the year-ago quarter. Cost of funds, including non-interest-bearing deposits, was 1.03% in the 2018 first quarter compared with 0.92% in the previous quarter and 0.78% in the year-ago quarter.\nNet interest margin was 4.33% in the 2018 first quarter compared with 4.27% in the previous quarter, and 4.15% in the year-ago quarter.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $95,000 for the 2018 first quarter compared with $1.7 million for the previous quarter and a negative provision of $198,000 for the year-ago quarter. The decrease in provision for loan losses for the 2018 first quarter compared to the previous quarter was primarily due to a decrease in net charge-offs. In the 2018 first quarter, the Company recorded a net recovery of $52,000 compared with a net charge-off of $1.1 million in the previous quarter. The allowance for loan losses to gross loan ratio was 1.01% at March 31, 2018, 1.03% at December 31, 2017, and 1.07% at March 31, 2017.\nNon-interest Income\nNon-interest income for the 2018 first quarter was in line with the previous quarter at $3.4 million and decreased $127,000 compared with $3.5 million for the year-ago quarter. The decrease compared with the year-ago quarter was primarily due to a decrease of $265,000 in gain on sale of SBA loans, partially offset by increases of $60,000 in loan servicing fees and $85,000 in other income.\nThe Company funded $52.1 million in SBA loans and sold $31.0 million of the guaranteed portion of SBA loans in the 2018 first quarter compared with $43.8 million in funding and $29.2 million sold during the previous quarter, and $61.1 million in funding and $36.4 million sold during the year-ago quarter. The Company funded $25.8 million in residential mortgage loans and sold $1.2 million in the 2018 first quarter compared with $24.0 million in funding and $2.1 million sold in the previous quarter and $15.4 million in funding and $2.7 million sold in the year-ago quarter.\nNon-interest Expenses\nNon-interest expenses for the 2018 first quarter were in line with the previous quarter at $9.6 million and increased $1.1 million, or 13.0%, compared with $8.5 million for the year-ago quarter. The increase compared with the year-ago quarter was primarily due to increases of $725,000 in employee salaries and benefits expenses, $169,000 in legal and professional expense, and $85,000 in marketing expense, partially offset by a decrease of $70,000 in loan related expense. The increase in salary and employee benefit expenses compared with the year-ago quarter consisted of additional expenses of $324,000 for an increase in employee headcount and annual salary adjustments, $230,000 for employee bonuses and incentive compensation, and $86,000 for employee group insurance.\nThe Company’s efficiency ratio in the 2018 first quarter was 51.62% compared with 52.58% in the previous quarter and 53.39% in the year-ago quarter.\nIncome Tax Provision\nThe Company’s effective income tax rate was 29.86% in the 2018 first quarter compared with 66.41% in the previous quarter and 42.41% in the year-ago quarter. The effective income tax rate in the 2018 first quarter decreased compared with prior quarters primarily due to the enactment of H.R. 1, also known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, on December 22, 2017. Beginning in 2018, H.R. 1 reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and changed or limited certain tax deductions. As a result of the lower corporate tax rate, during the previous quarter, the Company recorded a one-time revaluation adjustment of $1.6 million to reduce its deferred tax assets, which increased income tax expense.\nBALANCE SHEET SUMMARY\nTotal Assets\nTotal assets increased $137.0 million, or 9.5%, to $1,579.0 million at March 31, 2018 compared with $1,442.0 million at December 31, 2017 and increased $292.5 million, or 22.7%, compared with $1,286.4 million at March 31, 2017.\nLoans\nTotal loans receivable, including loans held-for-sale and net of deferred costs and fees, increased $34.2 million, or 2.9%, to $1,229.5 million at March 31, 2018 compared with $1,195.3 million at December 31, 2017 and increased $162.4 million, or 15.2%, compared with $1,067.0 million at March 31, 2017.\nDuring the 2018 first quarter, the Company funded $155.2 million in loans, sold $31.0 million of the guaranteed portion of SBA loans and $1.2 million in residential mortgage loans, recognized $88.7 million in loan principal pay-down/pay-off, and charged-off $139,000.
