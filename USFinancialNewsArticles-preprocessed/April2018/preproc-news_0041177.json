Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share was $0.57, an increase of 34 percent compared with the first quarter of 2017.\n“TransUnion is off to a good start in 2018, with double-digit revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS growth in the first quarter,” said Jim Peck, President and CEO. “This was driven by strong performance in each of our segments, highlighted by the ongoing success of our innovation pipeline, attractive vertical markets and outstanding international positions. As we look ahead, we are well positioned to continue to deliver strong results in 2018 and beyond.”\n“Today, we are also pleased to announce our agreement to acquire U.K.-based Callcredit. TransUnion and Callcredit have strong synergies across our business models and solutions, and we share a commitment to using information to benefit consumers and global economies alike. Callcredit is an outstanding acquisition for TransUnion, and together, we’ll be a powerful force to deliver value to shareholders, customers and consumers across all the markets we serve,” Peck added.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Segment Results\nU.S. Information Services (USIS)\nUSIS revenue was $342 million, an increase of 21 percent compared with the first quarter of 2017.\nOnline Data Services revenue was $228 million, an increase of 25 percent over the prior year. Marketing Services revenue was $52 million, an increase of 23 percent over the prior year. Decision Services revenue was $63 million, an increase of 8 percent over the prior year.\nOperating income was $83 million, an increase of 15 percent compared with the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted Operating Income was $114 million, an increase of 15 percent compared with the first quarter of 2017.\nInternational\nInternational revenue was $96 million, an increase of 15 percent (11 percent on a constant currency basis) compared with the first quarter of 2017.\nDeveloped markets revenue was $31 million, an increase of 12 percent (8 percent on a constant currency basis) over the prior year. Emerging markets revenue was $65 million, an increase of 17 percent (13 percent on a constant currency basis) over the prior year.\nOperating income was $14 million, an increase of 59 percent (51 percent on a constant currency basis) compared with the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted Operating Income was $26 million, an increase of 8 percent (4 percent on a constant currency basis) compared with the first quarter of 2017.\nConsumer Interactive\nConsumer Interactive revenue was $118 million, an increase of 12 percent compared with the first quarter of 2017. Revenue in the first quarter of 2018 included approximately $5 million of incremental credit monitoring revenue due to a breach at a competitor.\nOperating income was $53 million, an increase of 11 percent compared with the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted Operating Income was $55 million, an increase of 11 percent compared with the first quarter of 2017. Operating income and Adjusted Operating Income for the first quarter of 2018 included approximately $5 million of incremental credit monitoring income due to a breach at a competitor.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and cash equivalents were $154 million at March 31, 2018 and $116 million at December 31, 2017. Total debt, including the current portion of long-term debt, was $2.4 billion at March 31, 2018, compared with $2.5 billion at December 31, 2017.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, cash provided by operating activities increased to $101 million compared with $65 million in 2017, due primarily to the increase in operating performance. Cash used in investing activities was $31 million compared with $76 million in 2017, due primarily to slightly lower cash used for acquisitions. Capital expenditures were $27 million compared with $26 million in 2017. Cash used in financing activities was $33 million compared with $41 million in 2017. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was due primarily to cash used for our stock buy-back program, debt financing and contingent fees in 2017, partially offset by higher net principal debt outflows in 2018 compared with 2017.\n2018 Full Year Outlook\nFor the full year of 2018, we are raising our revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share guidance as follows. Revenue is expected to be between $2.170 billion and $2.185 billion, an increase of 12 to 13 percent on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $845 million and $855 million, an increase of 13 to 14 percent.

Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share includes a benefit of approximately $0.28 due to the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nConsistent with our previous full year guidance, the revenue guidance includes approximately 2 points growth from acquisitions that closed in the prior year, with no significant impact on revenue and Adjusted EBITDA from foreign exchange rates. Our guidance also includes approximately $15 million of incremental monitoring revenue due to a breach at a competitor, compared with $4 million in 2017. The expected increase in this incremental revenue represents 0.5 percent of the total growth.\n2018 Second Quarter Outlook\nFor the second quarter of 2018, revenue is expected to be between $534 million and $539 million, an increase of 12 to 13 percent on a constant currency basis compared with the second quarter of 2017.

Accordingly, the Company encourages investors, the media, and others interested in TransUnion to review the information that it shares on www.transunion.com/tru .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis earnings release presents constant currency growth rates on Schedule 1 and in our 2018 full year and Second Quarter Outlook sections assuming foreign currency exchange rates are consistent between years. This allows financial results to be evaluated without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. This earnings release also presents Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, segment Adjusted Operating Income, segment Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share. These are important financial measures for the Company but are not financial measures as defined by GAAP. We present these financial measures as supplemental measures of our operating performance because we believe they provide meaningful information regarding our performance and provide a basis to compare operating results between periods. We present Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income as supplemental measures of our operating performance because these measures eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our cash operations and ongoing operating performance. Also, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies similar to ours. In addition, our board of directors and executive management team use Adjusted EBITDA as a compensation measure. Furthermore, under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facility, our ability to engage in activities such as incurring additional indebtedness, making investments and paying dividends is tied to a ratio based on Adjusted EBITDA. These financial measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures of GAAP. Other companies in our industry may define or calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, including operating income, operating margin, effective tax rate, net income (loss) attributable to the Company, earnings per share or cash provided by operating activities. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are presented in the attached Schedules.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to TransUnion plus net interest expense, plus (less) provision (benefit) for income taxes, plus depreciation and amortization, plus stock-based compensation, plus mergers and acquisitions, divestitures and business optimization expenses, plus technology transformation expenses, plus (less) certain other expenses (income). Adjusted Operating Income is defined as operating income plus stock-based compensation, plus mergers and acquisitions, divestitures and business optimization expenses, plus technology transformation expenses, plus (less) certain other expenses (income), plus amortization of certain intangible assets. Adjusted Effective Tax Rate is defined as adjusted provision for income taxes divided by adjusted income before income taxes. Adjusted Net Income is defined as net income (loss) attributable to TransUnion plus stock-based compensation, plus mergers and acquisitions, divestitures and business optimization expenses, plus technology transformation expenses, plus (less) certain other expenses (income), plus amortization of certain intangible assets, plus or minus the related changes in provision for income taxes, less any one-time tax provision benefits from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by weighted-average diluted shares outstanding. The above definitions apply to our calculations for the historical periods shown on schedules 1 through 6 and for the periods covered by our guidance shown on Schedule 7.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis earnings release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
