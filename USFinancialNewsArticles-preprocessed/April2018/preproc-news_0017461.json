    "text": "CGG announces a successful offering of its $300 million and €280 million First Lien Senior Secured Notes\nParis, France - April 13, 2018\nCGG S.A. announces today that CGG Holding (U.S.) Inc., a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of CGG S.A., has successfully priced an offering of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 9.000% first lien senior secured notes due 2023 and €280 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.875% first lien senior secured notes due 2023. The notes will be issued at par. The notes are expected to be issued on April 24, 2018.\nCGG Holding (U.S.) Inc. intends to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with cash on hand, to redeem in full in accordance with their terms the entire outstanding principal amount of the existing first lien senior secured notes due 2023, issued in a principal amount of $663.6 million on February 21, 2018 (the \"Existing First Lien Notes\").\nThese new first lien senior secured notes represent a total principal amount of $645m (using yesterday's €/$ ECB reference rate of $1.2323 per €1) at a weighted average coupon of 8.40%. The refinancing of the Existing First Lien Notes by May 21, 2018 allows the CGG group to save the 3% rollover fee (representing approximately $20 million), reduces the group's interest cost compared to the Existing First Lien Notes (which bear cash interest at a rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 6.50% per annum and interest paid-in-kind at 2.05% per annum) and provides a shorter non call period (April 2020 under the new first lien notes versus February 2021 under the Existing First Lien Notes).\nThe Existing First Lien Notes are expected to have a redemption date of May 6, 2018, conditional on the issuance of the new first lien senior secured notes. Because the redemption date is not a Business Day (as such term is defined in the indenture governing the Existing First Lien Notes), the redemption price of, and accrued interest on, the Existing First Lien Notes are expected to be paid to the holders thereof on May 9, 2018, the next succeeding Business Day following the redemption date.\nAbout CGG\nCGG ( www.cgg.com ) is a fully integrated Geoscience company providing leading geological, geophysical and reservoir capabilities to its broad base of customers primarily from the global oil and gas industry.
