    "text": "Net sales of approximately $273 million in the first quarter\nOrganic sales rose 6.5 percent, as a result of growth in all geographic regions\nFirst quarter GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.18; Adjusted EPS excluding special items of $0.27\nAdjusted EBITDA of approximately $25 million, or 9.2 percent of sales, up 240 basis points\nCompany updates 2018 full year net sales, earnings and EBITDA outlook\nMINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Tennant Company (“Tennant”) (NYSE: TNC), a world leader in designing, manufacturing and marketing of solutions that help create a cleaner, safer, healthier world, today reported net sales of $272.8 million and net earnings of $3.3 million, or $0.18 per share, and adjusted net earnings of $5.0 million, or $0.27 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. The 2018 first quarter results reflected $2.3 million in pre-tax charges, or $0.09 per share, related to non-operational special items, including IPC acquisition integration costs. Additionally, the 2018 first quarter results included a pre-tax charge of $5.5 million, or $0.22 per share, from amortization of the intangible assets related to the IPC acquisition. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in the first quarter were $25.2 million, or 9.2 percent of sales, compared to $13.0 million, or 6.8 percent of sales, in the year-ago quarter. (See the Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Table).\n“We are very pleased with our strong start to the year and are well positioned for additional momentum throughout the rest of 2018,” said Chris Killingstad, Tennant Company's president and chief executive officer. “In the first quarter, we made important, ongoing progress against our growth and value-creation initiatives by improving field-service utilization and manufacturing efficiencies, introducing new products, developing strategic relationships to drive innovation, and executing on our sales strategy across all of our geographies, especially with our strategic accounts. We are confident in the platform we are building to enhance both top- and bottom-line performance, as well as the long-term success of the business.”\nFirst-Quarter Operating Review\nThe company's 2018 first quarter consolidated net sales of $272.8 million increased approximately 42.8 percent over the same period last year. This includes a 33.2 percent increase due to acquisitions, a foreign currency benefit of 3.1 percent and a 6.5 percent increase in organic sales. Organic growth during the period was driven by all regions, particularly the Americas.\nGeographically, sales in the Americas region improved 13.9 percent, up 8.2 percent organically, reflecting the impact of strategic accounts and improved sales in the company’s service, parts and consumables business in the North America region, as well as 11.4 percent organic growth in the Latin American region from strong growth in Brazil. Sales in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region were up 166.9 percent, or 2.1 percent organically, reflecting solid growth in the France, Netherlands and Iberian markets, as well as strategic accounts. Sales in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region rose 42.5 percent, up 1.0 percent organically, reflecting strong results in Australia.\nTennant's gross margin in the 2018 first quarter was 40.5 percent, compared to 41.7 percent in the same period last year, reflecting the negative mix of the IPC business of 66 basis points and a negative impact of an inventory write-down of approximately 40 basis points. Gross margin was also impacted by a higher mix of strategic accounts sales, which were partially offset by improved operational performance in both manufacturing and service. Throughout the first quarter, Tennant made progress on productivity initiatives within its field service truck operations and manufacturing operations, and the company remains intently focused on gross margin expansion.\nResearch and development (R&D) expense for the 2018 first quarter totaled $8.0 million, or 2.9 percent of sales, versus $8.4 million, or 4.4 percent of sales, a year ago. The lower-than-forecasted R&D expense for the first quarter reflects the timing of anticipated project spend in 2018, primarily related to the announcement of the company’s strategic relationship with Brain Corp (“Brain”) to accelerate development of Tennant’s autonomous floor cleaning technology. Tennant remains committed to investing in a robust pipeline of new products and technologies and expects 2018 R&D investments to be in line with the previously disclosed range of 3.0 to 3.5 percent of sales.\nSelling and administrative (S&A) expense in the 2018 first quarter was $92.3 million, or 33.8 percent of sales, compared to $74.0 million, or 38.7 percent of sales, a year ago. The first quarters of 2018 and 2017 included non-operational costs of $2.3 million and $10.9 million, respectively. Excluding these items, S&A expense as a percent of sales was 33.0 percent in both 2018 and 2017. In addition, the first quarter of 2018 included a non-cash amortization expense related to IPC of $5.5 million, or 2 percent of sales, which was not included in the prior year. Tennant continues to leverage disciplined spending control with investments in key growth initiatives. (See the Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Table.)\nTennant’s 2018 first quarter net earnings were $3.3 million, compared to a net loss of $4.0 million in the 2017 first quarter. Excluding the non-operational items, the 2018 first quarter net earnings were $5.0 million, compared to net earnings of $5.4 million in the 2017 first quarter.\nDuring the 2018 first quarter, Tennant generated cash flow from operations of $5.5 million, compared to net cash used in operations of $11.1 million in the 2017 first quarter. Cash on the balance sheet at March 31, 2018, totaled $54.0 million versus $58.4 million at December 31, 2017. The company’s total debt was $376.0 million compared to $380.0 million at the end of 2017. During the 2018 first quarter, Tennant paid $3.8 million in cash dividends to shareholders.\nNew Products and Technology\nIn 2018, Tennant Company plans to introduce new products and product variants to help drive our vitality index above the stated goal of 30 percent. So far this year, the company:\nLaunched its newest family of automatic scrubbers: the Tennant T600 Series. Each unit is designed with the latest in cleaning technology and innovation to deliver consistent, high-quality performance to exceed the needs of today’s facility managers and to deliver consistent results, reliable operation and quality assurance. Announced its plans to launch its first autonomous floor care machine designed to operate in complex, real-world environments without direct operator control. Through the company’s newly forged relationship with Brain, an artificial intelligence (“A.I.”) company specializing in technology for autonomous robots, the autonomous Tennant T7 will seamlessly integrate Brain’s proprietary A.I. robotic technology software platform, BrainOS ® , to deliver a cleaning solution designed to maximize productivity, increase efficiency and optimize safety. The first Tennant autonomous solution is expected to be available in North America on the T7 floor scrubber in late 2018 with further expansion into global markets and additional models to follow.\n2018 Business Outlook\nKillingstad concluded, “We are confident that the structural and operational improvements we made in 2017 are and will continue to drive strong results in 2018, and we are pleased to increase our previously announced 2018 full year guidance ranges for sales, adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA. The multiple initiatives we have in place to drive growth underscore our optimism. As we look ahead, we remain committed to maintaining our robust new product and technology pipeline and accelerating our leadership in this area, successfully completing the integration of IPC, building our global market coverage, improving operating efficiency and strengthening our financial position to generate significant returns for shareholders.”\nFollowing strong momentum and 2018 first quarter results, along with currency related tailwinds, Tennant is increasing the low and high end of the previously announced 2018 full year guidance range for sales by $10 million. The company anticipates net sales to be in the range of $1.08 billion to $1.11 billion, up 7.6 percent to 10.7 percent compared to the prior year and reflecting organic growth of 3.0 percent to 3.5 percent. Based on the anticipated higher level of sales, Tennant is increasing its anticipated range for adjusted earnings per share by $0.05 per share to a range of $1.85 to $2.05. This excludes $3.0 million to $4.0 million of special items, including IPC acquisition costs. The company expects the 2018 full year reported GAAP earnings to remain in the range of $1.70 to $1.90 per share and is increasing the anticipated adjusted EBITDA range by $2 million to a range of $113 million to $118 million.\nTennant's 2018 annual financial outlook includes the following additional assumptions:\nReasonable growth in all regions, especially strategic accounts in North America; Gross margin performance in the range of 41.0 percent to 42.0 percent; R&D expense in the range of 3.0 percent to 3.5 percent of sales; Capital expenditures in the range of $25 million to $30 million; and An effective tax rate of approximately 24 percent.\nConference Call\nTennant will host a conference call to discuss 2018 first quarter results today, April 23, 2018 at 10 a.m. Central Time (11 a.m. Eastern Time).

Management believes that the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors regarding the company’s results of operations and financial condition because they permit a more meaningful comparison and understanding of Tennant Company’s operating performance for the current, past or future periods. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to monitor and evaluate ongoing operating results and trends, and to gain an understanding of the comparative operating performance of the company.\nWe believe that disclosing Selling and Administrative Expense - as adjusted, Profit from Operations - as adjusted, Operating Margin - as adjusted, Profit Before Income Taxes - as adjusted, Income Tax Expense - as adjusted, Net Earnings Attributable to Tennant Company - as adjusted, and Net Earnings Attributable to Tennant Company per Share - as adjusted (collectively, the “Non-GAAP Measures”), excluding the impacts from restructuring charge, acquisition costs, certain non-operational professional services, and debt financing costs write-off, are useful to investors as a measure of operating performance. We use these as one measure to monitor and evaluate operating performance. The non-GAAP measures are financial measures that do not reflect United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). We calculate Selling and Administrative Expense - as adjusted, Profit from Operations - as adjusted, Operating Margin - as adjusted, and Profit Before Income Taxes - as adjusted by adding back the pre-tax effect of the restructuring charge, acquisition costs, and certain non-operational professional services. We calculate Income Tax Expense - as adjusted by adding back the tax effect of the restructuring charge, acquisition costs, certain non-operational professional services and debt financing costs write-off. We calculate Net Earnings Attributable to Tennant Company - as adjusted by adding back the after-tax effect of the restructuring charge, acquisition costs, certain non-operational professional services, and debt financing costs write-off. We calculate Net Earnings Attributable to Tennant Company per Share - as adjusted by adding back the after-tax effect of the restructuring charge, acquisition costs, certain non-operational professional services, debt financing costs write-off and dividing the result by the diluted weighted average shares outstanding.\nWe believe that disclosing Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) and EBITDA Margin, excluding the impact from restructuring charge, acquisition costs, certain non-operational professional services, and debt financing costs write-off (EBITDA - as adjusted), is useful to investors as a measure of operating performance. We use these measures to monitor and evaluate operating performance. EBITDA - as adjusted and EBITDA Margin are financial measures that do not reflect GAAP. We calculate EBITDA - as adjusted by adding back the pre-tax effect of the restructuring charge, acquisition costs, certain non-operating professional services, debt financing costs write-off Interest Income, Interest Expense, Income Tax Expense, Depreciation Expense and Amortization Expense to Net Earnings (Loss) - as Reported. We calculate EBITDA Margin - as adjusted by dividing EBITDA - as adjusted by Net Sales.\nInvestors should consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, not as a substitute for, or better than, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of the components of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Table to this earnings release.\nTENNANT
