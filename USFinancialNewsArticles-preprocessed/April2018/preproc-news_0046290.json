    "text": "WALLINGFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH) reported today GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) for the first quarter 2018 of $0.84 compared to $0.71 for the comparable 2017 period. GAAP Diluted EPS for the first quarter 2018 includes an excess tax benefit of approximately $4.1 million ($0.01 per share) related to stock options exercised during the quarter compared to approximately $8.0 million ($0.02 per share) for the comparable 2017 period. Excluding the effect of this item, Adjusted Diluted EPS 1 for first quarter 2018 and 2017 was $0.83 and $0.69, respectively.\nSales for the first quarter 2018 were $1.867 billion compared to $1.560 billion for the comparable 2017 period. Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $63 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the 2017 period.\nOn April 24, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a 21% increase in the Company’s dividend as well as a new three-year open market stock repurchase plan. The quarterly dividend will increase from $0.19 to $0.23 per share to be paid on July 10, 2018 to holders of record of the Company’s Class A common stock as of June 18, 2018. The new three-year open market stock repurchase plan is authorized for the purchase of up to $2 billion of the Company’s common stock.\nAmphenol President and Chief Executive Officer, R. Adam Norwitt, stated, “We are pleased to close the first quarter 2018 above the high end of our guidance with sales and Adjusted Diluted EPS in the quarter of $1.867 billion and $0.83, respectively. Compared to the first quarter 2017, sales increased a strong 20%, reflecting organic growth across most of the Company’s diversified end markets, including, in particular, mobile devices, military, industrial, automotive, and commercial air, together with contributions from the Company’s successful acquisition program. The Company continues to expand its growth opportunities through a deep commitment to developing enabling technologies for customers in all markets, an ongoing strategy of market and geographic diversification, as well as an active and successful acquisition program. The Company’s Adjusted Diluted EPS growth of 20% in the quarter was driven by our superior operating execution, as reflected in the Company’s achievement of a strong operating margin of 20.2%. I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute extremely well.”\n“Operating cash flow in the quarter was $130 million which included an $81 million payment made in the first quarter to fully fund our U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The Company continues to deploy its financial strength in a variety of ways to increase shareholder value. This included the purchase during the first quarter of 2018 of 4.2 million shares of the Company’s stock bringing total repurchases under the plan since inception in January 2017 to approximately 12.6 million shares, which completed our $1 billion open market stock repurchase plan”.\n“While we are pleased that the overall demand environment has improved, there remain many uncertainties surrounding global trade and economic policy. Considering this environment and based on current currency exchange rates, we expect second quarter 2018 sales in the range of $1.855 billion to $1.895 billion and Adjusted Diluted EPS in the range of $0.83 to $0.85. For the full year 2018, we now expect to achieve sales in the range of $7.630 billion to $7.750 billion, an increase over 2017 of 9% to 11%, as well as Adjusted Diluted EPS in the range of $3.49 to $3.55, an increase over 2017 of 12% to 14%.\n“The electronics revolution continues to create exciting, long-term growth opportunities for Amphenol. We are encouraged by the Company’s broad-based and strong results, and we remain confident for the future. New applications and higher performance requirements continue to drive increased demand for our broadened range of high technology products across all our diversified end markets. Our ongoing actions to leverage our competitive advantages and create sustained financial strength, as well as our initiatives to expand our high technology product offering both organically and through our successful acquisition program, have created an excellent base for future performance. I am confident in the ability of our outstanding, entrepreneurial management team to dynamically adjust to the always changing environment, to continue to generate strong profitability and to further capitalize on the many opportunities to expand our market position.”\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss its first quarter results at 1:00 PM (EDT) Wednesday, April 25, 2018.

The , which address the Company’s expected business and financial performance and financial condition, among other matters, may contain words such as: “anticipate,” “could,” “continue,” “expect,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “ongoing,” “project,” “seek,” “predict,” “target,” “will,”, “intend,” “plan,” “optimistic,” “potential,” “guidance,” “may,” “should,” or “would” and other words and terms of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, such as statements about expected earnings, revenues, growth, liquidity or other financial matters. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in such , including regarding the second quarter and full year 2018 sales expectations and GAAP and Adjusted Diluted EPS expectations, are based upon reasonable assumptions, the expectations may not be attained or there may be material deviation. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these , which speak only as of the date on which they are made.\nFactors that could cause actual results to these , include, but are not limited to, the following: the Company’s dependence on sales to the communications industry, in which markets are dominated by large manufacturers and operators who regularly exert significant pressure on suppliers such as the Company; the Company’s dependence on sales to the military market, including the impact of reductions or changes in the defense budgets of U.S. and foreign governments; the Company’s ability to compete successfully on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time; the Company’s ability to continue to conceive, design, source and market new products, as well as market acceptance of the Company’s existing and future product lines, for continued revenue growth; the Company’s ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms, including as a result of significant deterioration of general economic or capital market conditions, or as a result of a downgrade in the Company’s credit rating; changes in exchange rates of the various currencies in which the Company conducts business, including possible currency devaluations; changes in interest rates which could impact existing or future issuances of debt; changes in tax laws, regulations and guidance, including related interpretations, in the United States and international jurisdictions, such as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”); political, economic, military and other risks in countries outside of the United States, including political, economic, financial or other instability, intergovernmental conflicts or actions, strikes or natural disasters; the impact of general economic conditions, geopolitical conditions and U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs, including those affecting China, on the Company’s business operations; difficulties and unanticipated expenses in connection with purchasing and integrating newly acquired businesses as part of the Company’s growth strategy, including the potential for the impairment of goodwill; the Company’s ability to obtain a consistent supply of materials, at stable pricing levels, used in the Company’s manufacturing processes, including aluminum, steel, copper, titanium, metal alloys, gold, silver, certain rare earth metals and plastic resins; litigation or environmental matters including changes to laws and regulations that the Company may be subject to; and cybersecurity threats or incidents that could arise. Such may also be impacted by, among other things, clarifications to and additional guidance under the Tax Act. More specifically, on December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted and it significantly revised U.S. corporate income tax law by, among other things, reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% and implementing a modified territorial tax system that includes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The provisional income tax charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 incorporated assumptions made based upon the Company’s current interpretation of the Tax Act. As the Company receives additional clarification and implementation guidance and as the interpretation of the Tax Act evolves over time, the Company may record adjustments to such charge in 2018.\nA further description of these uncertainties and other risks can be found in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and the Company’s other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These or other uncertainties may cause the Company’s actual future results to be materially different than those expressed in any . The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe financial statements included within this press release are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). This press release also contains certain non-GAAP financial information, including Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, Adjusted Effective Tax Rate and Adjusted Diluted EPS (collectively, “non-GAAP financial measures”), which are intended to supplement the reported GAAP results. Management utilizes these non-GAAP financial measures as part of its internal reviews for purposes of monitoring, evaluating and forecasting the Company’s financial performance, communicating operating results to the Company’s Board of Directors and assessing related employee compensation measures. Management believes that such non-GAAP financial measures may be helpful to investors in assessing the Company’s overall financial performance, trends and period-over-period comparative results. Non-GAAP financial measures discussed within this press release exclude income and expenses that are not directly related to the Company’s operating performance during the periods presented. Items excluded in the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures in any period may consist of, without limitation, acquisition-related expenses, refinancing-related costs and certain discrete tax items including but not limited to the excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation as well as the provisional income tax charge recorded in 2017 related to the Tax Act and any subsequent adjustments recorded in 2018 related to this charge. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included at the end of this press release. However, such non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, as a substitute for or superior to the related GAAP financial measures. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily the same or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, as such measures may be calculated differently or may exclude different items. The non-GAAP financial measures are defined within the “Supplemental Financial Information” table at the end of this press release and should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP.\n1 All referenced non-GAAP financial measures are defined in the tables at the end of this press release.
