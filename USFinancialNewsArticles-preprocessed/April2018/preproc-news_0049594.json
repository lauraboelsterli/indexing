    "text": "COLUMBIA, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- First Farmers and Merchants Corporation (OTC Pink: FFMH), the holding company for First Farmers and Merchants Bank, today announced unaudited financial results for the quarter ending March 31, 2018.\nKey highlights of First Farmers’ results for the first quarter of 2018 include:\nNet income of $3.1 million or $0.70 per common share, up 45% from $2.2 million or $0.48 per common share for the previous quarter and up 31% from $2.4 million or $0.52 per common share for the year-earlier quarter; Adjusted net income, which excludes special items, of $3.1 million or $0.70 per common share, compared to adjusted net income of $3.2 million or $0.71 per common share for the previous quarter and $2.4 million or $0.52 per common share for the year-earlier quarter (see non-GAAP reconciliation); Loan growth of $9 million or 1% from the previous quarter and $22 million or 3% compared with the year-earlier quarter; Net interest margin of 3.31%, down from net interest margin of 3.38% for the previous quarter but up from 3.28% for the year-earlier quarter; and Non-interest income of $3.4 million up 7% from $3.2 million for the previous quarter and up 22% from $2.8 million for the year-earlier quarter.\nCommenting on the results, T. Randy Stevens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of First Farmers, said, “We are pleased to begin 2018 with record quarterly earnings and significant improvement in our results compared to the same period in 2017. Propelling our record earnings was our strategic focus to improve revenue with pricing discipline and grow non-interest income while limiting additional non-interest expense.” Stevens continued, “We remain focused on growing our non-interest income lines of business in 2018 while also looking for strategic opportunities within the Middle Tennessee market to expand our franchise by hiring talented bankers.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results of Operations\nThe improvement in first quarter of 2018 earnings of $968,000 compared with the previous quarter was driven by a decrease in provision for income taxes and an increase in non-interest income offset by an increase in non-interest expense. The $1.6 million decrease in provision for income taxes includes the deferred tax assets revaluation which resulted in a $1.0 million expense recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, in addition to a decrease in income taxes provision expense due to a reduced corporate tax rate effective under the new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation. The increase of $222,000 in non-interest income was primarily driven by an increase in trust services fee income of $167,000 and mortgage banking activities of $40,000. The increase of $579,000 in non-interest expense for the quarter includes an increase of $446,000 in other non-interest expenses driven by audit and examinations expense and other loan related expenses. The $748,000 increase in reported quarterly earnings for the first quarter of 2018 compared with the year-earlier quarter resulted from increases in net interest income after provision for loan and lease losses expense of $475,000 and non-interest income of $572,000, which were offset by an increase in non-interest expense of $283,000.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, outstanding loan balances increased $9 million from the previous quarter and increased $22 million or 3% from the year-earlier quarter. Net interest margin declined to 3.31% compared to 3.38% for the previous quarter but improved from 3.28% for the year-earlier quarter. The primary reason for the decline in the net interest margin from the prior quarter was the tax equivalent adjustment for tax-free investments and loans using the new, lower corporate tax rate. Adjusting for the impact of the new lower corporate tax rate, net interest margin continued to expand during the first quarter when compared to the previous quarter and the year-earlier quarter. Total deposits stood at $1.203 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2018, down $3 million from the previous quarter and $11 million or 1% from the year-earlier quarter.\nAsset Quality\nTotal nonperforming assets decreased to $2.7 million, or 0.20% of total assets, compared to $2.8 million, or 0.20% of total assets, for the previous quarter and declined from $3.3 million, or 0.24% of total assets, when compared to the year-earlier quarter. Net recoveries to average loans were 0.02% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to net charge-offs of 0.02% for the previous quarter and net recoveries of 0.01% for the year-earlier quarter. As a result of the improvement in the quality of the loan portfolio coupled with an increase in net recoveries, no provision for loan and lease losses expense was recorded during the first quarter of 2018. The allowance for loan and lease losses represented 1.06% of total loans outstanding for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 1.07% for the previous quarter and 1.11% for the year-earlier quarter.\nCapital Management Initiatives\nFirst Farmers repurchased 7,000 shares of common stock, during the first quarter, at an average price of $41.50 per share under its stock repurchase program. Authorization to repurchase approximately 193,000 shares remains under the current program, which is set to expire in December 2018, unless extended or otherwise completed.\nAbout First Farmers and Merchants Corporation and First Farmers and Merchants Bank\nFirst Farmers and Merchants Corporation is the holding company for First Farmers and Merchants Bank, a community bank serving the Middle Tennessee area through 22 offices in eight Middle Tennessee counties.
