Mr. Willits is responsible for several businesses within this group, including Cargill's oil palm plantations, trading and merchandising in the Asia-Pacific region, and Cargill's grains and oilseeds supply chain businesses in North Asia, South Asia and Australia.\nMr. Willits joined Cargill in 1980 as a merchant in its grain division. He has held numerous merchandising and management positions in Indiana, Missouri and Minnesota. In 1991, Mr. Willits went on to manage Cargill's international wheat trading activities in Geneva, Switzerland and in 1995 he moved to Argentina to manage Cargill's grain business. Mr. Willits moved back to the United States in 2000 to work for Cargill AgHorizons and went on to lead its specialty canola oils business.\nIn 2008, Willits was named president of Cargill Corn Milling North America, where he oversaw all aspects of the corn processing business until taking on the role as the leader of Cargill's agriculture supply chain enterprise in the Asia Pacific region in June 2014. Mr. Willits holds a Bachelor's of Science degree from the University of Illinois, College of Agriculture.\nMark Wong, S&W's Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"We are very pleased with the appointment of Alan Willits to S&W's board of directors.

Alan's understanding of the agricultural supply chain and processing in key end markets should serve us exceptionally well as we look to advance our stevia commercialization program. We look forward to capitalizing on his years of experience and contacts within the industry to advance our goal of evolving S&W into a premier middle market agricultural company in the years to come.\"\nMr. Willits commented, \"I look forward to working with the team at S&W to drive advancements in their core crop portfolio as they look to become an increasingly diversified middle agricultural company in the years to come.
