    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani spoke by telephone on Sunday and agreed to work together in coming weeks to preserve the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, the Elysee said in a statement.\nFILE PHOTO: A combination of file photos showing French President Emmanuel Macron attending a meeting at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France, May 23, 2017, and Iran President Hassan Rouhani looking on at the Campidoglio palace in Rome, Italy, January 25, 2016. REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer/Alessandro Bianchi/File Photos In a conversation lasting more than an hour, Macron also proposed that the discussions be broadened to cover “three additional, indispensable subjects”, his office said, citing Tehran’s ballistic missile programs, its nuclear activities beyond 2025 and “the main regional crises” in the Middle East.\nThe United States has been trying to drum up support for new sanctions against Iran, and has repeatedly threatened to tear up the 2015 agreement.\nReporting by Laurence Frost; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ",
