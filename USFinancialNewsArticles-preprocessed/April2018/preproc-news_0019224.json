    "text": "(Adds details from testimony, Zuckerberg preparation, Monday meetings)\nWASHINGTON, April 9 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told Congress on Monday that the social media network did not do enough to prevent itself and its members' data being misused over the past few years and offered an apology to lawmakers.\nHis conciliatory tone in written testimony precedes two days of Congressional hearings, where Zuckerberg is set to answer questions about Facebook user data being improperly appropriated by a political consultancy and the role the network played in the U.S. 2016 election.\n\"Its clear now that we didnt do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm...\" he said in remarks released by the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee on Monday. \"That goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections, and hate speech, as well as developers and data privacy.\"\nZuckerberg was meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Monday, ahead of his scheduled appearance before two Congressional committees on Tuesday and Wednesday.\nTop of the agenda will be Facebook's admission that the personal information of up to 87 million users, mostly in the United States, may have been improperly shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.\n\"We didnt take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake,\" his testimony continued. \"It was my mistake, and Im sorry. I started Facebook, I run it, and Im responsible for what happens here.\"\nFacebook, which has 2.1 billion monthly active users worldwide, said on Sunday it plans to begin telling users whose data may have been shared with Cambridge Analytica on Monday. The company's data practices are under investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.\nLondon-based Cambridge Analytica, which counts U.S. President Donald Trumps 2016 campaign among its past clients, has disputed Facebooks estimate of the number of affected users.\nZuckerberg also said that Facebook's major investments in security \"will significantly impact our profitability going forward.\" Facebook shares were up 1.7 percent in midday trading.\nONLINE INFORMATION WARFARE\nFacebook has about 15,000 people working on security and content review, rising to more than 20,000 by the end of 2018, Zuckerberg's testimony said. \"Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits,\" he said.\nOn Friday, Facebook backed proposed legislation requiring social media sites to disclose the identities of buyers of online political campaign ads and introduced a new verification process for people buying issue ads, which do not endorse any candidate but have been used to exploit divisive subjects such as gun laws or police shootings.\nThe steps are designed to deter online information warfare and election meddling that U.S. authorities have accused Russia of pursuing, Zuckerberg said on Friday. Moscow has denied the allegations.\nZuckerberg's testimony said the company was \"too slow to spot and respond to Russian interference, and were working hard to get better.\"\nHe vowed to make improvements, adding it would take time, but said he was \"committed to getting it right.\"\nA Facebook official confirmed that the company had hired a team from the law firm WilmerHale and outside consultants to help prepare Zuckerberg for his testimony and how lawmakers may question him.\n(Reporting by David Shepardson and Dustin Volz Editing by Bill Rigby)",
