    "text": "DALLAS, April 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Howard Hughes Corporation ® (NYSE: HHC) announced today that its CEO, David R. Weinreb, sold 400,000 shares of HHC common stock in a private transaction to satisfy personal tax obligations arising from the exercise and settlement of shares under the Warrant Purchase Agreement, dated as of November 22, 2010, between him and HHC. Mr. Weinreb continues to own 1,224,803 shares of HHC stock with a current market value of $167 million, 50,374 shares of performance-based restricted stock which he received in connection with the renewal of his employment contract, and warrants to acquire 1,965,409 shares of HHC stock which he acquired in June 2017 from the company for $50.0 million, their fair market value at the time of issuance. The June 2017 warrants cannot be hedged, sold or exercised until June 2022.\nOther than the 50,374 shares of performance-based stock which he received in connection with his August 2017 employment agreement, all shares and warrants owned by Mr. Weinreb were acquired by him for fair market value in open market or private transactions as he had not previously received any option or restricted stock grants.\n\"I have tremendous confidence in the Company's long-term prospects as demonstrated by my recent warrant purchase and continued substantial ownership position in the Company,\" said Mr. Weinreb. \"My goal is to continue to increase my ownership in the Company over the coming years as we execute across our three business lines and grow the intrinsic value of The Howard Hughes Corporation.\"\nAbout The Howard Hughes Corporation®\nThe Howard Hughes Corporation owns, manages and develops commercial, residential and mixed-use real estate throughout the U.S. Its award-winning assets include the country's preeminent portfolio of master planned communities, as well as operating properties and development opportunities including: The Seaport District NYC in New York; Columbia, Maryland; The Woodlands®, The Woodlands Hills, and Bridgeland® in the Greater Houston, Texas area; Summerlin®, Las Vegas; and Ward Village® in Honolulu, Hawaiʻi.
