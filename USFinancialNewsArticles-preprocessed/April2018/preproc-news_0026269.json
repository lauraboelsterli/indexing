    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Vince Holding Corp. (NYSE:VNCE), a leading global luxury apparel and accessories brand (“Vince” or the “Company”), today reported unaudited results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 ended February 3, 2018.\nIn this press release, the Company is presenting its financial results in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") as well as on an \"adjusted\" basis. Adjusted results presented in this press release are non-GAAP financial measures. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for more information about the Company's use of non-GAAP financial measures and Exhibit 3 to this press release for a reconciliation of GAAP measures to such non-GAAP measures.\nFor the 14 weeks ended February 3, 2018:\nSales increased 16.9% including $1.6 million from the 14 th week Direct-to-Consumer comparable sales grew 16.1% on a 13-week basis Operating loss was $6.6 million compared to $62.9 million. Adjusted operating loss was $1.5 million compared to an adjusted operating loss of $7.8 million in the same period last year Diluted earnings per share was $6.41 compared to a loss per share of $32.81. Adjusted net loss per share was $0.20 compared to a loss of $1.55 per share in the same period last year\nBrendan Hoffman, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We were pleased with our fourth quarter results, which reflect the significant progress we’ve made toward regaining market share. Our strong comparable sales results illustrate that our product is resonating with consumers and that the demand for the Vince brand remains strong. Our largest comp increase came from locations in proximity to department stores that we have exited, demonstrating that our efforts to capture these customers in our own stores are working. As we place greater emphasis on our Direct-to-Consumer growth strategy, we plan to opportunistically open stores in key street and mall locations that are appropriate for the Vince brand. In our wholesale business, our partnerships with Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus are progressing very well and we are beginning to see our collaborative efforts yield benefits.”\nMr. Hoffman continued, “We are pleased with the continued momentum in our direct to consumer channel and sell thru at the department store thus far in the first quarter. There is great enthusiasm surrounding the Vince product, which is highly encouraging as we look ahead. We will continue to execute our strategic initiatives and believe that we are on the right track to deliver sustainable profitable growth over the long term.”\nFor the fourth quarter ended February 3, 2018:\nNet sales increased 16.9% to $74.6 million, including $1.6 million in sales from the 14 th week, compared to $63.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Wholesale segment sales increased 11.7% to $38.5 million as compared to the same period last year. The 14 th week had an immaterial impact on the wholesale segment. Direct-to-consumer segment sales increased 22.9% to $36.2 million compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, including $1.6 million in sales from the 14 th week. Comparable sales increased 16.1% on a 13-week basis, including e-commerce sales, primarily due to an increase in average unit retail. Gross profit was $34.0 million, or 45.5% of net sales, compared to gross profit of $29.2 million, or 45.7% of net sales, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The decrease in gross margin rate was largely due to a mix shift in the wholesale channel and an unfavorable adjustment to inventory reserves, partially offset by lower supply chain costs and a favorable adjustment to reserves related to the cost of executing the Company’s wholesale distribution strategy. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $40.5 million, or 54.3% of sales, compared to $39.1 million, or 61.1% of sales, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. This includes non-cash asset impairment charges related to property and equipment of certain retail stores of $5.1 million in fiscal 2017 and $2.1 million in fiscal 2016. The decline in SG&A dollars, excluding the aforementioned non-cash asset impairment charges, was primarily the result of the non-recurrence of investments related to the transition of IT systems made last year, as well as lower product development costs and savings related to ending the Company’s consulting arrangement with its founders. This was partially offset by increased incentive compensation costs and investments related to the remediation and optimization of IT systems. Operating loss was $6.6 million, which included $5.1 million related to the aforementioned non-cash asset impairment charges. Operating loss was $62.9 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, which included impairment charges of $22.3 million related to goodwill associated with the Company’s direct-to-consumer business, $30.8 related to the tradename intangible asset, and $2.1 million as a result of the aforementioned non-cash charge for retail stores. Excluding the aforementioned charges, adjusted operating loss was $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to adjusted operating loss of $7.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Other income reflects a Tax Receivable Agreement (“TRA”) adjustment of $82.0 million related to lower federal tax rates due to the new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as for the Company’s updated five-year projections. Net income was $74.5 million, or $6.41 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $162.1 million, or $32.81 per share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 includes the aforementioned TRA adjustment, a negligible benefit from income taxes due to the offsetting impact of the tax valuation allowance, and the aforementioned non-cash asset impairment charge. The net loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 included a negative impact related to the aforementioned non-cash asset impairment charges as well as the valuation allowance recorded against the Company’s deferred tax assets. Excluding the aforementioned charges, adjusted net loss was $2.4 million, or $0.20 per share, as compared to adjusted net loss of $7.7 million, or $1.55 per share, in the same period last year. Please refer to Exhibit 3 for a reconciliation. The Company ended the quarter with 55 company-operated stores, an increase of one store since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.\nFor the fiscal year ended February 3, 2018:\nNet sales increased 1.6% to $272.6 million from $268.2 million during fiscal year 2016, including $1.6 million from the 53 rd week. Wholesale segment net sales decreased 2.3% to $166.1 million and direct-to-consumer segment net sales increased 8.5% to $106.5 million compared to fiscal year 2016, including $1.6 million from the 53 rd week. Comparable store sales on a 52-week basis increased 4.5% compared to the prior year period, including e-commerce sales. Net income was $58.6 million, or $7.70 per diluted share, which includes the aforementioned TRA adjustment, a negligible benefit from income taxes due to the offsetting impact of the tax valuation allowance, and the aforementioned non-cash asset impairment charge. This compares to net loss of $162.7 million, or $35.04 per share, in fiscal 2016, which includes a negative impact related to the non-cash asset impairment charges as well as the valuation allowance recorded against the Company’s deferred tax assets. Excluding the aforementioned charges, adjusted net loss was $18.3 million, or $2.41 per share, as compared to adjusted net loss of $8.2 million, or $1.76 per share, in the same period last year. Please refer to Exhibit 3 for a reconciliation.\nBalance Sheet\nThe Company ended the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 with $5.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and $49.9 million of borrowings under its debt agreements. The $0.3 million decrease in borrowings under its debt agreements over the prior year period is due to $12.0 million of payments to the term loan facility, offset by net higher borrowings under the revolving credit facility.\nNet inventory at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $48.9 million compared to $38.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.\nCapital expenditures for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 totaled $0.4 million.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, the Company has provided, with respect to financial results relating to the fourth quarter and the fifty-three week period of fiscal 2017, adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted income (loss) before income taxes, adjusted income taxes, adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per share, which are non-GAAP measures, in order to eliminate the effect on operating results of non-cash asset impairment charges, the TRA adjustment, and the offsetting impact of the valuation allowance recorded against the Company’s deferred tax assets. In addition, with respect to the fourth quarter and fifty-two week period of fiscal 2016, the Company has provided adjusted operating loss, adjusted loss before income taxes, adjusted income taxes, adjusted net loss and adjusted loss per share, which are non-GAAP financial measures, in order to eliminate the effect on operating results of non-cash asset impairment charges and the valuation allowance recorded against the Company’s deferred tax assets. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures facilitates an understanding of the Company's continuing operations without the impact associated with the aforementioned items. While these types of events can and do recur periodically, they are excluded from the indicated financial information due to their inherent volatility and impact on the comparability of earnings across periods. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results has been provided in Exhibits 3 to this press release.\n2017 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call\nA conference call to discuss the fourth quarter results will be held today, April 12, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. ET, hosted by Vince Holding Corp.
