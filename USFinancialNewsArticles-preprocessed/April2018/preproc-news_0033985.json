    "text": "April 19, 2018 / 4:42 PM / Updated 2 hours ago German lawmakers to grill Facebook manager on data privacy Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \nBERLIN (Reuters) - German lawmakers will question a senior Facebook Inc manager about data privacy in the wake of revelations that the personal information of millions of users wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File Photo \nLawmakers in the Bundestag lower house of parliament will grill Joel Kaplan, Facebook’s vice president for global public policy, during a closed-door session on Friday morning. \nThe meeting mirrors the appearance of Facebook’s Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg before a U.S. Congressional joint hearing on April 10-11 over the scandal engulfing the world’s largest social network. \nThe 87 million Facebook users affected included nearly three million Europeans and Zuckerberg is also under pressure from EU lawmakers to come to Europe to shed light on the data breach. \n“Facebook needs to show more openness and transparency when dealing with user data,” said Nadine Schoen, deputy leader of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative bloc in the Bundestag. \nShe said Facebook needed to do more than just pay lip service and it remained to be seen how serious the company was about really improving user rights. \n“It is not enough to exchange the gray T-shirt and jeans for suit and tie,” she said in reference to Zuckerberg’s appearance in the U.S. Congress. \nThe senior lawmaker said that Facebook so far was giving the impression that it only wanted to save its business model. \n“For example, the company is already rowing back in the supposedly world-wide announced implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation,” Schoen warned, referring to privacy rules that will enter force in the European Union next month. \n“We no longer need excuses, but facts,” she said. \nGerman Justice Minister Katarina Barley last month summoned executives of the firm, including European public affairs chief Richard Allan. \nMisuse of data by Facebook means it will in future be bound by stricter regulations and the threat of tougher penalties for further privacy violations, Barley said after the meeting.
