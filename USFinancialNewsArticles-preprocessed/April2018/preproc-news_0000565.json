    "text": "DALLAS, April 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dave & Buster's Entertainment, Inc., (NASDAQ:PLAY), (\"Dave & Buster's\" or \"the Company\"), an owner and operator of entertainment and dining venues, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter 2017, which ended on February 4, 2018. The Company also issued its guidance for the full year 2018.\nKey highlights from the fourth quarter 2017 (14 weeks) compared to the fourth quarter 2016 (13 weeks) include:\nTotal revenues increased 12.9% to $304.9 million from $270.2 million. Opened five new stores compared to four new stores. Comparable store sales (13 weeks) decreased 5.9%. Net income of $35.6 million, or $0.85 per diluted share ($25.6 million, or $0.61 per diluted share excluding the net tax benefit under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), vs. net income of $27.4 million, or $0.63 per diluted share. EBITDA increased 4.3% to $70.8 million from $67.9 million and Adjusted EBITDA increased 10.7% to $82.5 million from $74.5 million. Pre-opening costs increased $4.1 million to $9.1 million from $5.0 million. The extra week in fiscal year 2017 generated approximately $19.7 million in revenue, $0.9 million in net income, $3.4 million in EBITDA, and $4.3 million in Adjusted EBITDA.\nKey highlights from the full year 2017 (53 weeks) compared to the full year 2016 (52 weeks) include:\nTotal revenues increased 13.4% to $1.140 billion from $1.005 billion. Opened 14 new stores compared to 11 new stores. Comparable store sales (52 weeks) decreased 0.9%. Net income of $120.9 million, or $2.84 per diluted share ($110.9 million, or $2.60 per diluted share excluding the net tax benefit under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), vs. net income of $90.8 million, or $2.10 per diluted share. EBITDA increased 12.4% to $268.5 million from $238.8 million and Adjusted EBITDA increased 15.8% to $302.7 million from $261.5 million. Pre-opening costs increased $8.3 million to $23.7 million from $15.4 million.\n“2017 was another outstanding year for us as we delivered double-digit revenue, Net Income and EBITDA growth. Our primary growth vehicle and the biggest driver of value continues to be opening stores that offer excellent returns in the face of a more intense competitive environment. However, recent sales trends in our comparable stores have been disappointing and we are working diligently to re-build momentum by evolving the brand,” said Steve King, Chief Executive Officer.\n“While results were below our early December guidance, we remain confident in our long-term prospects. We have a strong track-record of disciplined growth and our operating team continues to execute well in a more challenging environment while recognizing the need to adapt and adjust. In terms of margins, we delivered relatively flat EBITDA margins for the full year despite a slight decrease in comparable store sales and significantly higher pre-opening expenses associated with our strong lineup of 2018 stores,” said Brian Jenkins, Chief Financial Officer.\nShare Repurchase Activity\nDuring fiscal year 2017, we repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares of our common stock for $151.9 million. Cumulatively, as of March 28, 2018 we had repurchased approximately 3.7 million shares for $202.8 million. As of the same date, we had $97.2 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization.\nReview of Fourth Quarter 2017 Operating Results\nTotal revenues increased 12.9% to $304.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 (14 weeks) from $270.2 million in the fourth quarter 2016 (13 weeks). The additional 14 th week increased total revenue by $19.7 million. Across all stores, Food and Beverage revenues increased 10.0% to $138.6 million from $126.0 million and Amusement and Other revenues increased 15.3% to $166.3 million from $144.2 million. Food and Beverage represented 45.5% of total revenues while Amusements and Other represented 54.5% of total revenues in the fourth quarter 2017. In last year’s fourth quarter, Food & Beverage represented 46.6% of total revenues while Amusements and Other represented 53.4% of total revenues.\nComparable store sales (13 weeks), decreased 5.9% in the fourth quarter 2017 compared to a 3.2% increase in the same period last year. Our comparable store sales decrease was driven by a 6.4% decrease in walk-in sales and a 2.9% decrease in special events sales. Comparable store sales in Amusements & Other decreased 4.2% and in Food & Beverage decreased 7.8%. Non-comparable store revenues (13 weeks) increased $29.7 million or 67.5% in the fourth quarter 2017 to $73.6 million.\nOperating income decreased to $42.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 (14 weeks) from $44.7 million in last year's fourth quarter (13 weeks). The additional 14 th week increased operating income by $1.4 million. As a percentage of total revenues, operating income decreased approximately 260 basis points to 13.9% from 16.5%.\nNet income increased to $35.6 million, or $0.85 per diluted share (41.7 million diluted share base), in the fourth quarter of 2017 (14 weeks) compared to net income of $27.4 million, or $0.63 per diluted share (43.4 million diluted share base), in the same period last year (13 weeks). The additional 14 th week increased net income by $0.9 million. Net income in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 included a net tax benefit of $8.0 million or $0.19 per diluted share related to revaluation (non-recurring) of our deferred tax positions and $2.0 million or $0.05 per diluted share related to the lower statutory tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Net income excluding these net tax benefits would have been $25.6 million, or $0.61 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nEBITDA increased 4.3% to $70.8 million in the fourth quarter 2017 (14 weeks) from $67.9 million in the same period last year (13 weeks). The additional 14 th week increased EBITDA by $3.4 million. As a percentage of total revenues, EBITDA decreased approximately 190 basis points to 23.2% from 25.1%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 10.7% to $82.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 (14 weeks) from $74.5 million in the same period last year (13 weeks). The additional 14 th week increased Adjusted EBITDA by $4.3 million. As a percentage of total revenues, Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased approximately 60 basis points to 27.0% from 27.6%.\nStore operating income before depreciation and amortization increased 8.1% to $94.3 million in the fourth quarter 2017 (14 weeks) from $87.2 million in last year's fourth quarter (13 weeks). The additional 14 th week increased store operating income before depreciation and amortization by $5.1 million. As a percentage of total revenues, Store operating income before depreciation and amortization decreased 140 basis points to 30.9% from 32.3%.\nDevelopment\nWe opened five stores during the fourth quarter in Brandon (Tampa), Florida; Woodbridge, New Jersey; Auburn, Washington; White Marsh (Baltimore), Maryland; and Bayamon, Puerto Rico for a total of fourteen stores for the year. Total capital additions (net of tenant improvement allowances) during fiscal year 2017 were $183.0 million.\nWe are confirming our plan to open a total of fourteen to fifteen new stores in fiscal 2018, including two 17K format stores, representing unit growth of 13% to 14%. These openings will skew towards the first half of the fiscal year, large store format and existing markets for our brand. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, we have already opened four stores in Rogers, Arkansas (our first 17K format store); Memphis, Tennessee; Wayne, New Jersey; and Anchorage, Alaska. We plan to open two additional stores in Madison, Wisconsin and Rosemont, Illinois during the first quarter.\nFinancial Outlook\nWe are providing our initial financial outlook for fiscal 2018, which ends on February 3, 2019:\nTotal revenues of $1.20 billion to $1.24 billion Comparable store sales decrease in the low-to-mid single digits (on a comparable 52-week basis) 14 to 15 new stores Net income of $95 million to $110 million Effective tax rate of 23% to 24% (including the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017) and diluted share count of approximately 41 million shares EBITDA of $255 million to $275 million Total capital additions (net of tenant improvement allowances and other landlord payments) of $170 million to $180 million\nConference Call Today\nManagement will hold a conference call to discuss these results today at 4:00 p.m. Central Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time).
