View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180416006226/en/\nProminent Texas Trial Lawyer Mike Gruber joins Dorsey & Whitney's Dallas Office (Photo: Business Wire).\nMr. Gruber represents companies, executives, bankruptcy trustees, wealthy families, trusts and individuals as plaintiffs and defendants in a wide range of high-stakes commercial litigation and other contentious matters. He has achieved success for clients in matters ranging from warring families in major probate disputes to bankruptcy to breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, intellectual property ownership claims and energy and real estate investments gone bad. He is as skilled in counseling on litigation avoidance and pre-litigation strategy as he is in trial in state and federal courts in Texas, as well as in other jurisdictions. Mr. Gruber is Board Certified in Civil Trial Law by the Texas Board of Legal Specialization. He is co-author of the two-volume treatise “Texas Litigation Plans and Forms.”\nMr. Gruber joins Dorsey from the Dallas-based business litigation law firm of Gruber Hail Johansen Shank LLP where he was a co-founding partner. Before co-founding Gruber Hail in 2006, he was a partner in a number of Texas-based firms for over 20 years.\nHe has a B.S. degree from Southern Methodist University and a J.D. degree from the SMU Dedman School of Law, where he served as an editor of the Law Review and as president of the Student Bar Association.

He has also been selected as a “Best Lawyer in Dallas” in the area of Business Litigation by D Magazine and as one of the “500 Most Influential Business Leaders” in Dallas.\nMr. Gruber is extremely active in the legal profession and in the Dallas community. He has chaired multiple committees of the Dallas Bar Association and has served as a Criminal Justice Act panel attorney eligible for appointment by the U.S. federal court to represent individuals in criminal cases who are unable for financial reasons to retain counsel. He is the 2018 Mask Award Honoree for service to the United Negro College Fund for the Dallas Region. He has also received the Sagar Award from the national Minority Corporate Counsel Association for his sustained commitment to improving the hiring, retention and promotion of minority attorneys. In 2015, he received the SMU Dedman School of Law Distinguished Alumni Award. He has also received the Dallas Bar Association Justinian Award and the Dallas Association of Young Lawyers Award of Excellence in recognition of his service to the profession and to the community.\nMr. Gruber serves as Chairman of the Southern Gateway Project and the Lieutenant Governor’s Legislative Committee on Economic and Workforce Development. He has served as Chairman of the Board of the Dallas Zoo, the Dream Dallas Project of Habitat for Humanity, the Dallas Nature Center and the North Texas Region of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. He has been very active in numerous other charitable and civic organizations, including the Basic English Program, Catholic Foundation Advisory Board, Children’s Education Fund, North Texas Entrepreneur Foundation, North Texas Region of Big Brothers, among many others.\n“Mike Gruber is an exceptional trial lawyer and litigation strategist,” noted Ken Cutler, Managing Partner of Dorsey & Whitney. “We are delighted to add him to our Dallas team and to our Firm-wide trial practice, which has always been one of Dorsey’s hallmarks.”\n“I am extremely pleased to be joining Dorsey and its great Firm-wide team of trial lawyers,” noted Mr. Gruber. “Dorsey is an extraordinary law firm with a deep commitment to client success and the resources to back up that commitment.
