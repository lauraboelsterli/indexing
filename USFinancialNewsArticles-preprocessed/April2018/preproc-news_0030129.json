    "text": "April 16, 2018 / 7:40 AM / Updated 7 minutes ago European shares steady ahead of new U.S. sanctions on Russia Danilo Masoni 4 Min Read \nMILAN (Reuters) - European shares steadied on Monday as investors expected there would be no immediate military escalation in Syria following the weekend’s American-led strike. The German share price index, DAX board, is seen at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, March 19, 2018. REUTERS/Staff/Remote \nTrading however remained cautious as tensions between Western powers and Russia persisted and markets braced for new U.S. sanctions on Russia over its continued support of Syrian President Bashar-al Assad. \n“The subdued nature of the (market) response may however be tested with U.S. Treasury Secretary (Steven) Mnuchin expected to announce additional Russian sanctions on Monday,” said Rabobank strategists in a note. \nThe pan-regional STOXX 600 index was down 0.1 percent by 0832 GMT, while among other European benchmarks, the FTSE .FTSE was down 0.2 and Germany's DAX .GDAXI was flat. \nOver the weekend, the United States, France and Britain launched 105 missiles targeting what the Pentagon said were three chemical weapons facilities in Syria in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack in Douma. \nOn the corporate front, shares in advertising group WPP ( WPP.L ) fell as much as 5.3 percent after chief executive and founder Martin Sorrell quit, leaving the group without a boss at a time of huge change in the industry \n“The fact is that there is a lot of uncertainty ahead. It is not clear whether the current margin targets or dividend payout will survive management change,” said Citi analyst Thomas Singlehurst, who however reiterated his buy rating on the stock, citing the company’s current depressed valuation. \nWPP shares, which have already fallen 30 percent this year, pared part of their losses and were down 2.1 percent. Analysts and peers have speculated that the group of 200,000 people could be broken up without Sorrell at the helm. \nTop STOXX gainer was Whitbread ( WTB.L ), up 6.2 percent after U.S. activist investor Elliott Management said it now held the largest stake in the coffee-shop and hotel operator. \nSoftware AG ( SOWGn.DE ) was among the leading fallers, down 4.4 percent. Traders said the fall was due to weaker-than-expected quarterly revenues at its Digital Business Platform business. \nAs investors awaited the new sanctions on Russia, which a U.S. diplomat said would target companies that were dealing with equipment related to Assad and chemical weapons use, shares in some Russian exposed companies underperformed. \nPrecious metals miner Polymetal ( POLYP.L ) fell 4.1 percent, underperforming its peers, miner Evraz ( EVRE.L ) fell 2.4 percent, while Austrian lender Raiffeisen Bank RIV.VI declined 1.9 percent. \nSwiss pumpmaker Sulzer ( SUN.S ), which was last week freed from U.S. sanctions related to its Russian investor Viktor Vekselberg, slipped 0.3 percent. Over the weekend Sulzer said its business was “fully back to normal” after it received a second licence fully unblocking its assets. Reporting by Danilo MasoniEditing by Robin Pomeroy",
