    "text": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Swiss Re ( SRENH.S ) estimated that global insured losses from catastrophes in 2017 hit $144 billion, the most ever, it said on Tuesday.\nFILE PHOTO: A condominium complex is reduced to rubble after Hurricane Harvey struck in Rockport, Texas, U.S., August 26, 2017. REUTERS/Rick Wilking/File Photo The figure is an upward revision from an earlier tally in December, when the reinsurer estimated $136 in insured losses.\nNorth America was particularly hard hit, with Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria resulting in combined insured losses of $92 billion, equal to 0.5 percent of U.S. gross domestic product, Swiss Re said.\nInsured losses from wildfires totaled $14 billion, the most ever in one year, the reinsurer said.\nReporting by Tom Sims; Editing by Maria Sheahan\n ",
