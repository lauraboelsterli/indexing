    "text": "Adam Eaton went 5-for-5 with a homer plus four runs scored with three RBI, and Brian Goodwin hit a grand slam as the Washington Nationals defeated the Cincinnati Reds 13-7 on Saturday afternoon in Cincinnati.\nMatt Adams and Trea Turner also homered for Washington (2-0). Adams’ homer gave Washington a lead it never lost, and Eaton banged out two doubles, two singles plus a solo homer during the first five-hit game of his career.\nThe Goodwin grand slam came in the ninth off of Kevin Quackenbush.\nWashington starter Stephen Strasburg (1-0) went 6 1/3 innings and allowed three runs on eight hits.\nAdams was playing at first base in place of starter Ryan Zimmerman, who sat out almost all of the spring training games.\nHowever, new manager Dave Martinez had planned this move and told the media before the game that Zimmerman was just fine.\nAdams came up with two on and one out in the first and crushed a pitch from Luis Castillo (0-1) far into the seats in right-center for a quick 3-0 lead.\nBryce Harper made it 4-0 with his sacrifice fly in the third. Turner added his solo shot in the fourth for a 5-0 lead.\nThe Reds (0-2) scored when Scott Schebler hit a solo homer in the fourth. Harper answered with another sacrifice fly to put Washington up 6-1 in the fifth.\nCincinnati got two back off of Strasburg in the sixth thanks to a Scooter Gennett RBI single and an Adam Duvall sacrifice fly but the right-hander escaped with a 6-3 lead.\nCastillo allowed six runs on six hits in six innings and never recovered from the Adams homer in the first\nEaton then homered off of Austin Brice in the seventh before the Reds loaded the bases with no outs. However, Strasburg struck out Eugenio Suarez before Sammy Solis retired the next two to keep the 7-3 lead.\nEaton got his fifth hit in the eighth, a two-run single, but Duvall answered with a two-run homer that cut the lead to 9-5 in the bottom half. Goodwin then added his first career grand slam in the ninth.\nSuarez hit a two-run shot in the ninth for the 13-7 final.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
