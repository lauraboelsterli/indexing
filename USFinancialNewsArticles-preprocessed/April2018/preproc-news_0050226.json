    "text": "NEW YORK, April 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Greystone, a commercial real estate lending, investment, and advisory company, announced it has provided a $28.5 million Fannie Mae DUS loan for the acquisition of Carmel Pointe in Sacramento, California. Greystone’s Northern California Advisory team, which consists of Simon Herrmann, Todd Vitzthum, and Cody Field, worked closely with the borrower to ensure a seamless process.\nThe loan carries a seven-year fixed rate with two years of interest-only and stepdown prepay. As part of the Green Rewards program, Greystone was able to secure favorable terms with higher proceeds.
