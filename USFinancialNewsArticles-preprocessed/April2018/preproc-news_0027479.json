    "text": "UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Sweden proposed a United Nations Security Council resolution on Thursday that would ask U.N. chief Antonio Guterres to send a high-level disarmament team to Syria to address “all outstanding issues on the use of chemical weapons once and for all.”\nThe 15-member council failed on Tuesday to approve three draft resolutions on chemical weapons attacks in Syria. Russia vetoed a U.S. text, while two Russian-drafted resolutions failed to get a minimum nine votes to pass.\nReporting by Michelle Nichols; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ",
