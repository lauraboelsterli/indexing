    "text": "Anthony Davis scored 28 points, and the New Orleans Pelicans clinched a playoff berth with a 113-100 victory over the host Los Angeles Clippers on Monday night at Staples Center.\nThe Pelicans (47-34) won their fourth consecutive game as they completed a sweep of a three-game road trip to reach the playoffs for the first time in three years. They sit in fifth place in the Western Conference going into their season finale at home against San Antonio on Wednesday.\nThe Spurs and Oklahoma City have the same record as New Orleans, which holds the head-to-head tiebreaker against the Thunder and leads the season series with San Antonio 2-1.\nThe Pelicans were the seventh team in the West to clinch a playoff spot. The remaining spot will go to the winner of the game between Denver and Minnesota on Wednesday night in Minneapolis.\nDavis led four Pelicans in double figures as they pulled away from the short-handed Clippers at the start of the second half. Nikola Mirotic had 24 points and a career-high 16 rebounds, E’Twaun Moore scored 19 and Ian Clark returned from a two-game absence caused to a sprained ankle to score 13 off the bench.\nThe Clippers (42-39), who were eliminated from the playoff race when they lost to Denver on Saturday, were without seven injured players Monday — Lou Williams, Austin Rivers, Danilo Gallinari, Patrick Beverley, Avery Bradley, Milos Teodosic and Jawun Evans.\nSindarius Thornwell scored 20, Montrezl Harrell had 15, Boban Marjanovic 12, Tobias Harris 11 and Tyrone Wallace and C.J. Williams 10 each to lead Los Angeles.\nNew Orleans led by 10 at halftime and started the third quarter with a 20-4 run to take a 79-53 lead midway through the period. The Pelicans held a 93-71 lead after three quarters, and Los Angeles didn’t reduce the margin until New Orleans pulled its starters in the final minutes.\nThe Pelicans made 5 of 11 3-point attempts and the Clippers missed all four of their 3-point tries as New Orleans took a 31-23 lead after the first quarter.\nThe lead grew to 11 before the Pelicans went cold, scoring five points in a nearly six-minute span as Los Angeles took a one-point lead.\nThe Clippers took their final lead of the half at 49-47 before Mirotic scored five points to lead a 12-0 run that gave New Orleans a 59-49 halftime lead.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
