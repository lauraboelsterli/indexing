    "text": "GlaxoSmithKline's new shingles vaccine - a priority product as the company strives to improve its drugs line-up - has won more than 90 percent U.S. market share just five months after its launch, prescription-tracking data show.\nThe healthy take-up comes at the expense of Merck's older and less effective product Zostavax, which has seen a slump in demand.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended Shingrix over Zostavax in adults 50 years and older, spurring demand for the GSK vaccine.\nDeutsche Bank analysts said on Tuesday the prescription data to mid-March implied \"a very strong launch\", even though the figures compiled by health information company IQVIA capture only 50 to 60 percent of the market.",
