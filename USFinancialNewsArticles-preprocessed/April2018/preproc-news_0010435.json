    "text": "ANKARA (Reuters) - Four people were killed and three others were wounded on Thursday in a shooting at the Osmangazi University in Turkey’s northwestern province of Eskisehir, the school’s rector and local media said.\nThe gunman, a researcher at the university, shot dead the assistant dean, faculty secretary, lecturer, and a staff member from the education faculty of the university, rector Hasan Gonen told Turkish media. Broadcaster CNN Turk said three others had been wounded in the shooting.\nGonen said the assailant entered the university’s education faculty with a gun and shot the four university staff members.\nFootage from the scene showed several police officers and medical staff in the area, while students and university staff were treated at ambulances.\nPolice had detained the gunman, the state-run Anadolu news agency and other media reported.\nThe motive of the gunman was not immediately clear. A reporter for Anadolu, speaking on CNN Turk, said he had surrendered rather than trying to escape.\nReporting by Tuvan Gumrukcu; Editing by David Dolan and Dominic Evans\n ",
