REUTERS/Tyrone Siu/File Photo \nLater this month in San Francisco, the ride-hailing firm will launch Uber Rent in collaboration with Getaround, a peer-to-peer car sharing service that offers privately owned cars for rent. \n“We’re going beyond cars. We are about mobility - making mobility available to everyone, everywhere,” Uber Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi said at a forum on Wednesday in Washington. “We want to be part of the solution.” \nUber also announced a partnership with Masabi, which offers mobile ticketing services for public transport, to let customers book and use tickets for train, bus and ferry services in the app. \nUber is also expanding Uber Bike by JUMP to Washington, D.C., following its rollout in San Francisco earlier this year, and new efforts to promote car sharing. ( ubr.to/2qqVw8P ) \nUber is vowing to work with U.S. cities, which Khosrowshahi noted will see a rising percentage of the country’s population. The company has at times had a contentious relationship with some major cities. \nHe said the company backs a number of transportation solutions. \n“That’s going to include bikes, and that’s going to include buses and subways, etc., and we want to be a part of the solution,” he said, adding that Uber is sharing more data with cities to help them manage congestion. \nGoing forward, Uber will be less about simply booking a car but travelling “from Point A to Point B in the best way” with a variety of transit options, he said. \nOne big challenge, he added, is the future of the world’s 1.2 billion vehicles. “We have to solve the issue of car ownership,” Khosrowshahi said. \n“As an asset class, cars are very inefficient” he added, noting that 95 percent of the time cars sit unused. “We have to work together to make sure that living in a city... doesn’t require you to own a car.” Reporting by Sonam Rai in Bengaluru and David Shepardson in Washington ; Editing by Bernard Orr and Leslie Adler",
