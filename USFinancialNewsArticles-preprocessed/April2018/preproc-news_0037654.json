    "text": "Arizona left fielder David Peralta singled in a run to break up a scoreless tie in the eighth inning, and left-hander Patrick Corbin pitched a one-hitter in the Diamondbacks’ 1-0 victory over the visiting San Francisco Giants on Tuesday.\nJarrod Dyson walked with one out in the eighth inning off Tony Watson (1-1) and took second on Corbin’s sacrifice bunt. Peralta then singled up the middle as the D-backs (12-4) tied the best start in franchise history.\nCorbin (3-0) gave up a single and a walk while pitching his first career complete game. He struck out eight, relying mainly on a slider. He is tied for the NL lead in victories.\nBrandon Belt, a left-handed hitter, broke up Corbin’s no-hitter with two outs in the eighth inning on a check-swing single down the third base line against a shift. Shortstop Nick Ahmed, the only player on the left side of the infield, got to the ball but could not get enough on his throw.\nGiants starter Johnny Cueto (2-1) almost matched Corbin through seven innings. Cueto gave up two singles, struck out 11 and did not walk a batter. Cueto made his first start since April 4 after spending 12 days on the disabled list due to a sprained left ankle.\nAlex Avila had a two-out single in the second inning off Cueto, and Dyson had a two-out single in the fifth.\nCorbin retired the first 10 before walking Joe Panik with one out in the top of the fourth inning, the only Giants runner until Belt’s single.\nArizona center fielder A.J. Pollock made a diving catch to his left in medium-deep center field to take an extra-base hit away from Buster Posey for the final out of the seventh inning, the Giants’ hardest hit ball of the game.\nSt. Louis right-hander Jose Jimenez has the only no-hitter at Chase Field, a 1-0 victory over Randy Johnson on June 25, 1999.\nSan Francisco third baseman Evan Longoria was a late scratch after tweaking an ankle when he stood in against Derek Holland tracking pitches during the left-hander’s bullpen work. He is expected to miss a couple of days, manager Bruce Bochy said.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
