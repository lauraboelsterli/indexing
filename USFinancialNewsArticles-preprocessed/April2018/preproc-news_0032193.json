The U.S.-China tariff standoff has heightened volatility in financial markets over the past month.\nDiverging interest rate views have driven the spread between U.S. and German 10-year government bond yields above 230 basis points, the highest since late December 2016.\nThe euro had weakened to a 14-year low the last time the yield spread was at the current width. But it has been relatively immune to the current yield spread widening. The spread has increased more than 30 basis points over the past three months but the common currency has moved within a relatively narrow $1.2556-$1.2154 range.\nThe euro inched up 0.07 percent to $1.2383 after eking out small gains the previous day.\nThe yen showed little response to the U.S.-Japan summit, at which Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed to intensify trade consultations between the two longtime allies.\nTurkey’s lira stood tall after rallying more than 2 percent against the dollar overnight after the country’s president Tayip Erdogan called for elections to be held in June, more than a year earlier than planned.\nThe lira was supported as Erdogan’s call for early elections was seen as the government’s recognition for the need for tighter monetary policy to combat inflation.\nThe lira last stood at 4.011 against the dollar, with the previous day’s surge moving it significantly away from a record low of 4.194 set last week.\nBattered by concerns towards monetary policy and inflation, the lira is one of the worst performing emerging market currencies so far this year.\nThe Canadian dollar was another big mover, having slid 0.6 percent against the dollar after the Bank of Canada did not sound as hawkish as some had anticipated.\nThe BoC indicated on Wednesday that more interest rate hikes would be coming after it held its benchmark rate steady at 1.25 percent, but said it did not know when or how aggressive it would need to be to keep inflation in check.\n“We maintain the same view held before this meeting; the BoC wants to raise rates in July and left the door wide open but we doubt that data will allow them to walk through it,” wrote strategists at Rabobank.\n“Headline data may be relatively upbeat but a scratch below the surface unveils a very different picture.”\nThe loonie was a shade weaker at C$1.2637 per dollar , pulled away from a seven-week high of C$1.2528 reached before the BoC meeting.\nThe 10-year Treasury note yield was 2.863 percent after touching 2.876 percent overnight, its highest since March 22.\nReporting by Shinichi Saoshiro Editing by Shri Navaratnam and Sam Holmes\n ",
