    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ensurge, Inc. [OTC Pink: ESGI] is pleased to announce that throughout the past year, it has completed the acquisition of several properties in Guyana. These properties include gold, diamond, and tantalite concessions. All of the acquired properties are licensed and permitted. The details of these properties have been recently added to the company’s website, www.ensurgeinc.com .\nThe company has commenced pilot operations in April of 2018 at the Kaburi property. Ensurge’s goal is to prepare further geological reports for the areas that include deeper deposits while it produces from the shallower, lost cost gold zones. The company has been working with a local engineer and a geologist to execute a more environmentally friendly mining method using a concentrator built in Canada. This will allow the company to use a chemical free system for recovery and could increase the recovery rate upwards of 90%. The company will also prospect on this property for diamonds, as the recovery system can be used for gold, diamonds, and other precious metals. Ensurge continues its goal to be a significant producer of tantalite. Efforts to design, engineer, and permit a tantalum refinery continue to progress.\nEnsurge is continuing its efforts to become a SEC fully reporting company. The company has engaged S.D. Mayer and Associates, a San Francisco based auditing firm, to complete audited financial statements for years 2016 and 2017. The auditors have conducted their site visit in Guyana and are working with the company to complete the audit. The company expects to have the audit completed in May of 2018.\nMore information about Ensurge, Inc. may be found online at www.ensurgeinc.com .\nForward-Looking Statements\nSafe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nCertain statements in this press release constitute \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
