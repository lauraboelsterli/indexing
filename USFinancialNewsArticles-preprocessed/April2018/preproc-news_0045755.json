    "text": "TOKYO, April 25 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks slipped on Wednesday as weakness on Wall Street soured risk sentiment, while the spotlight fell on Takeda Pharmaceutical which stumbled after it sweetened its takeover bid for Shire to 46 billion pounds ($64 billion).\nThe Nikkei ended 0.3 percent lower to 22,215.32.\nTakeda dived 7.0 percent as investors fretted about its ability to finance the cash and stock deal.\nShire said in a statement it had agreed to extend a Wednesday regulatory deadline for the deal talks to conclude to May 8 in order to allow Takeda to carry out more due diligence and firm up its bid.\nConstruction equipment makers were also sold-off after an overnight fall in Caterpillar Inc, which was hit by concerns that rising materials costs could squeeze profit margins following U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s crackdown on steel imports.\nKomatsu Ltd dropped 3.4 percent and Hitachi Construction Machinery shed 3.5 percent.\nThe broader Topix declined 0.1 percent to 1,767.73.
