Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors including risks relating to the ability to continue to extend current government contracts and obtain new contracts; the Company’s ability to obtain new commercial contracts; the performance of the business acquired in the ABL acquisition; the Company’s ability to perform under its contracts in accordance with the requirements of the contracts; the actual cost incurred in performing its contracts and the Company’s ability to manage its costs; dependence on third parties; future capital needs; the ability to fund its capital needs through the use of its cash on hand and line of credit; and the future availability and cost of financing/capital sources to the Company.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180416005902/en/\nBIOQUAL, Inc.\nMark G.
