Greenland’s Prime Minister Kim Kielsen holds an oil-bearing rock from Greenland in Nuke, Greenland, June 2, 2016. REUTERS/Alister Doyle \nThe territory’s population, with just over 40,000 eligible voters, went to the polls on Tuesday, many of them hoping to get their fragile economy up to speed to realize a long-term goal of independence from Denmark. \nThe social-democratic Siumut party won 27 percent of votes, down from 34 percent four years ago. \nThat sets the stage for coalition talks with either the left-wing Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA) party or Demokraterne, which emerged as the third biggest party with 20 percent, taking votes from both Siumut and IA. \nGreenland, a part of the Kingdom of Denmark but with self-rule since 2009, relies on fishing and annual grants from Denmark.
