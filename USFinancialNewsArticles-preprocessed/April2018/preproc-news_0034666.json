    "text": "April 18 (Reuters) - Rating agency Moody’s Investors Service said on Wednesday Russia’s strong public and external finances would shield its economy from the impact of the latest U.S. sanctions.\nHowever, the sanctions will be credit negative for some Russian debt issuers, especially Russian aluminum giant United Company Rusal Plc, Moody's said bit.ly/2HgdbXS in a report.\nThe Russian banking system has enough earnings capacity for absorbing credit losses arising from exposures to sanctioned companies, Moody’s said.
