That occurred after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi presented a relatively confident outlook for the euro zone economy, boosting the euro. A weaker dollar makes metals cheaper for holders of other currencies.\n* LONG POSITION: The speculative long position in LME aluminium was estimated to have retreated to 21 percent of open interest by Tuesday’s close, from 26 percent a day earlier, Alastair Munro at broker Marex Spectron said in a note.\n* ALUMINIUM PREMIUM: The U.S aluminium premium on Comex was at 21.4 cents per pound ($472 a tonne), down from a three-year high of 22.1 cents hit on April 11.\n* PRICES: LME copper fell 0.6 percent to close at $6,965 a tonne, lead added 1.3 percent to $2,336, nickel rose 0.4 percent to $14,200 and tin was up 0.7 percent at $21,400.\n* For the top stories in metals and other news, click or\nAdditional reporting by Tom Daly in Beijing Editing by Dale Hudson and David Goodman\n ",
