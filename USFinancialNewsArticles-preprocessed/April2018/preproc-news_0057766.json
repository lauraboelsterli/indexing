In addition, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share, payable on June 22, 2018 to stockholders of record on May 25, 2018.\n2018 First Quarter Results:\nConsolidated revenue for the first quarter of 2018 under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) was $43.1 million compared to $41.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. On January 1, 2018, Spok adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Unless otherwise stated, results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts have not been adjusted, and continue to be reported in accordance with the Company’s historic accounting under ASC 605.\nThree months ended (Dollars in thousands) March 31,\n2018\nMarch 31,\n2018 (1)\nMarch 31,\n2017\nChange (2)\n(%)\nWireless revenue\nPaging revenue $ 23,308 $ 23,308 $ 24,972 (6.7 )%\nProduct and other revenue 961 961 888 8.2 % Total wireless revenue $ 24,269 $ 24,269 $ 25,860 (6.2 )%\nSoftware revenue Operations revenue $ 9,471 $ 8,189 $ 6,041 35.6 % Maintenance revenue 9,374 9,999 9,543 4.8 % Total software revenue 18,845 18,188 15,584 16.7 % Total revenue $ 43,114 $ 42,457 $ 41,444 2.4 % (1) Adjusted to exclude the adoption of ASC 606.\n(2) As compared against results adjusted to exclude the adoption of ASC 606.\nGAAP net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.5 million, or $0.03 per share, compared to $0.9 million, or $0.04 per share, in the first quarter of 2017.\nThree months ended (Dollars in thousands) March 31,\n2018\nMarch 31,\n2018 (1)\nMarch 31,\n2017\nNet income $ 511 $ 309 $ 854 Net income per share $ 0.03 $ 0.02 $ 0.04 EBITDA $ 3,463 $ 3,250 $ 4,605 (1) Adjusted to exclude the adoption of ASC 606.\nOther key results and highlights for the first quarter of 2018 included:\nSoftware bookings of $18.1 million, compared to $19.8 million in the prior year quarter. First quarter 2018 bookings included $7.1 million of operations bookings and $11.0 million of maintenance renewals, compared to $9.5 million of operations bookings and $10.3 million of maintenance renewals in the first quarter of 2017. Software backlog totaled $35.9 million at March 31, 2018, or $42.7 million adjusted to exclude the adoption of ASC 606, compared to $40.6 million in the year earlier period. As a result of the adoption of ASC 606 approximately $5.3 million of backlog, that could have been recognized in 2018 under prior accounting rules, was re-cast to retained earnings as part of the beginning balance as of January 1, 2018. The revenue renewal rate for software maintenance in the first quarter of 2018 was greater than 99 percent. Paging units in service at March 31, 2018 totaled 1,030,000, compared to 1,091,000 at the end of the prior year period. The quarterly rate of wireless revenue erosion was 1.3 percent in the first quarter of 2018 versus 2.5 percent in the year-earlier quarter. Consolidated operating expenses (excluding depreciation, amortization and accretion) totaled $39.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $36.8 million in the year-earlier quarter. Capital returned to stockholders in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $4.7 million, in the form of $2.8 million from the regular quarterly dividend and $1.9 million of share repurchases. The Company’s cash balance at March 31, 2018 was $101.3 million, compared to $118.9 million at March 31, 2017, and $107.2 million at December 31, 2017.\nManagement Commentary:\n“We are encouraged with our performance in the first quarter of 2018 and believe that it provides a solid base for the remainder of the year,” said Vincent D. Kelly, chief executive officer. “First quarter results were in line with our seasonal expectations, and we saw strong year-over-year performance in a number of key operating measures, including revenue levels and average deal size, as well as wireless subscriber retention. We accomplished this as we increased our investment in our business by enhancing and upgrading our product development team and tools as well as our sales infrastructure and management. We believe this effort will yield significant future benefits in the form of our improved, integrated communication platform, Spok Care Connect®, as well as higher future bookings levels, and ultimately margins, supported by our enhanced and upgraded sales team. Overall, we continued to operate profitably, enhance our product offerings, and operate as a debt-free company. We also executed against our capital allocation strategy.” Kelly added, “Throughout 2018, we will remain focused on returning value to our shareholders through our capital allocation strategy, which includes dividends, share repurchases and key strategic investments in our products and business to create sustainable growth.”\nBusiness Outlook:\nFor the full-year 2018, adjusted to exclude the adoption of ASC 606, the Company continues to expect total revenue to range from $161 million to $177 million, operating expenses (excluding depreciation, amortization and accretion) to range from $158 million to $165 million, and capital expenditures to range from $4 million to $8 million.\n2018 First Quarter Call and Replay:\nThe Company plans to host a conference call for investors to discuss its 2018 first quarter results at 10:00 a.m. ET on Thursday, April 26, 2018.

(b) EBITDA or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion is a non-GAAP measure and is presented for analytical purposes only. (c) EBITDA is the starting point for calculation of operating cash flow for purposes of the Company’s short term and long term incentive plans. Management and the Board of Directors also rely on EBITDA for purposes of determining the Company’s capital allocation policies. We define OCF as EBITDA less purchases of tangible assets and severance expense in determining whether management has achieved certain performance objectives for the year as set by our Board of Directors in awarding annual and long term incentive compensation to senior executives. (d) Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted to exclude the adoption of ASC 606. Adjusted EBITDA is used by the Company for purposes of comparison to prior period results during its year of transition (2018) under the modified retrospective approach.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180425006676/en/\nSpok Holdings, Inc.\nAl Galgano, 952-567-0295\nAl.Galgano@spok.com\nSource: Spok Holdings, Inc.",
