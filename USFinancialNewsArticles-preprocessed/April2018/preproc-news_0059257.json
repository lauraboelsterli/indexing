    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling fell to a 6-week low versus the dollar on Friday as investors awaited British economic growth data that could determine whether the Bank of England raises interest rates in May.\nPound notes and coins are seen inside a cash register in a bar in Manchester, Britain September 6, 2017. REUTERS/Phil Noble Markets are split over whether the central bank will raise rates to curb inflation at the BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee meeting early next month.\nGovernor Mark Carney marred confidence that a hike would happen when he said last week economic data in Britain was “mixed” and that there were several other MPC meetings later this year.\nThat sent sterling plummeting from post-Brexit vote highs and left it down for the month of April.\nThe economic release is due out at 0830 GMT and is expected to show growth slowing modestly, owing in part to bad weather, which hurt retail and construction.\nGraphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\nGraphic: Trade-weighted sterling since Brexit vote tmsnrt.rs/2hwV9Hv\nReporting by Tom Finn; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ",
