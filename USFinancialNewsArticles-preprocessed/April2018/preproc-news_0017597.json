(NASDAQ:WETF), an exchange-traded fund (“ETF”) and exchange-traded product (“ETP”) sponsor and asset manager, announced today that it has completed its previously announced acquisition of ETF Securities’ European exchange-traded commodity, currency and short-and-leveraged business (“ETFS”), which includes $17.6 billion of assets under management (“AUM”) as of April 10, 2018.\nWith the addition of ETFS, WisdomTree's AUM has increased to approximately $63.4 billion globally as of April 10, 2018. The acquisition elevates WisdomTree to the 9th largest ETP sponsor globally and the largest global independent ETP provider based on AUM, with significant scale and presence in the U.S. and Europe, the two largest ETP markets.\nConsideration for the acquired business was $253 million of cash and stock consideration equivalent to 30 million shares of WisdomTree common stock, representing total consideration of $523 million based on the market close on April 10, 2018. The cash portion of the purchase price was funded with $53 million of balance sheet cash and $200 million from a newly raised term loan.\nJonathan Steinberg, WisdomTree CEO and President, said, “The completion of the acquisition brings together two undeniable forces in the industry, strongly positioning WisdomTree as a differentiated and diversified ETP provider that can thrive globally.
