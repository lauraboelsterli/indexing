    "text": "Scott Eells | Bloomberg | Getty Images Tim Pawlenty \nRepublican Tim Pawlenty is going to officially declare his run for Minnesota governor, making him the latest high-profile business executive to make a push for political office, according to sources with direct knowledge of the matter. \nPawlenty is expected to announce his run Thursday afternoon, according to the sources, who declined to be named. \nPawlenty, who had already served two terms as Minnesota's governor, will be trying to flip a seat that's been held by Democratic incumbent Mark Dayton for the past seven years. Dayton isn't running for a third term. \nA spokesman for Pawlenty declined to comment while a spokesperson for Dayton did not return calls for comment at the time of publication. In February, Pawlenty resigned his role as CEO of the Financial Services Roundtable, a powerful lobbying organization that works with some of the top Wall Street banks. Pawlenty was widely expected to run in the Minnesota race. \nThe former 2012 GOP presidential candidate brings years of political experience, name recognition and a potential donor war chest to a governor's race that has only a few declared candidates, many of them from the state legislature. \nPawlenty previously was governor of the state from 2003 to 2011. Although he failed to capture the Republican presidential nomination in 2012, he became a co-chairman of former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney's campaign against then-President Barack Obama. \nPawlenty then went on to lead the roundtable, whose members include American Express , Citigroup and Wells Fargo . He resigned from the post in February as rumors swirled that he would be going back to running for public office. Big potential war chest \nPawlenty had the financial backing from powerful business leaders when he ran for president, and they may be following his lead this time around, too. \nHis campaign committee raised $5 million during the 2012 campaign, including a $10,000 contribution from former Target executive John Griffith and $45,000 from the American Action Network, a nonprofit advocacy group which focuses on policies that lean to the right of the political spectrum. \nRepublicans will likely celebrate Pawlenty's candidacy as they have been craving a candidate they can hang their platform on without having to worry about an anti-establishment message. \n\"Pawlenty is a huge addition to the Republican efforts across the map this fall. Specifically in Minnesota, Pawlenty's entrance to the race is the type of game changer Republicans need,\" one Republican strategist told CNBC on the condition of anonymity. \n\"Pawlenty is not only experienced and has a very good image with voters across the ideological spectrum, he's also demonstrated a level of confidence that most voters are looking for this fall and it's exactly the type of thing Republicans want in every ticket in every state,\" the strategist added.
