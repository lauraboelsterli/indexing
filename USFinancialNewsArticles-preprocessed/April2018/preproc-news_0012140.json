    "text": "Maybe it's a sign of the times and a strong economy. Or maybe it's a sign that people are just tired of plain, monochromatic cars.\nWhatever the reason, automakers are finally putting an added dash of color in the looks of some of their latest models, giving them fancy two-tone paint jobs.\nToyota introduced the next version of the RAV4, a compact that was the nation's most popular SUV last year, at the New York Auto Show last week with a contrasting roof color — white or black — depending on the version. Hyundai's Genesis followed up with a stunning concept car that included a startling choice of metallic gray on the body with a large swatch of glossy black down the hood.\nThey join other two-tones already on the market from Land Rover, Volvo and the automaker best known for leading the modern version of the trend more than a decade ago, Mini.\nIn an age when many people may drive the same model of vehicle, custom-looking paint schemes allow for more personalization.\n\"Not everyone wants to drive the same car as their neighbor,\" said Stephanie Brinley, analyst for IHS Markit. \"People still want something that feels special.\"\nRead more from USA Today: \nGM to kill Chevrolet Sonic, Ford to discontinue Fiesta, Taurus, report says \nNew York Auto Show: How Nissan Altima, Toyota Camry, Honda Accord will survive the car plague \nTop 10 must-see cars from the New York Auto Show \nThe trend is made feasible by automotive factories where robotic painting makes it easier to color cars in ways that might not have been as possible in the past, said Rebecca Lindland, an analyst for Kelley Blue Book. Plus the results are eye-catching.\n\"It emphasizes customization,\" Lindland said after viewing Genesis' gray-and-black Essentia sports-car concept at the auto show, which is open to the public through Sunday. \"It has a custom look but not a custom price,\" she said of two-tone cars.\nTwo-tone paint jobs are associated with the 1950s, when pastels were popular and the boomerang-shaped designs of the era and chrome striping were on full display on the sides of cars. But the look disappeared in the 1960s and 1970s — along with white-wall tires — as cars got lower and sleeker.\nThese days, the two-tone look is generally restricted to having a roof that's a different color than a car's body. BMW got the party rolling when it brought its British icon Mini to the U.S., giving buyers a choice of roof colors including wild designs such as a Union Jack decal.\nIn the case of RAV4, the decision to go with white or black roofs on the outdoorsy Adventure and hybrid versions reflect the compact SUV's youthful buyer profile. Buyers were asking for more color, said Jack Hollis, head of the Toyota division introducing the car.\n\"It's adding extra personality,\" he said. \"We see it as a fun way to add more style.\"\nIn the case of Essentia, Genesis design director Luc Donckerwolke acknowledges that he didn't choose a common paint scheme for a concept car by going two-tone. But, he points out, \"we don't dress in a monochromatic way\" so why should cars be any different?",
