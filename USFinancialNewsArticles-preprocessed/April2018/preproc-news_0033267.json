    "text": "April 18, 2018 / 6:25 AM / Updated 19 minutes ago Hammerson withdraws recommendation that shareholders back Intu deal Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nApril 18 (Reuters) - Hammerson Plc has withdrawn its recommendation to shareholders that they back a merger with Intu Properties Plc, the British property company said on Wednesday. \nThe withdrawal of the recommendation alone will not cause a lapse of Hammerson’s offer or terminate a co-operation agreement between the two companies, Hammerson said. \nHammerson said it concluded that the “heightened risks associated with the Intu acquisition outweigh the long-term rewards that can be expected in comparison to other strategic options open to the company”. \nFrench shopping centre operator Klepierre abandoned a 5 billion pound ($7.15 billion) bid for Hammerson last week, accusing the British company of failing to provide “meaningful engagement” over a potential deal. $1 = 0.6990 pounds Reporting by Arathy S Nair in Bengaluru; editing by Jason Neely",
