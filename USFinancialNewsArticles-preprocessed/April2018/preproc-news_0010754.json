    "text": "TORONTO, April 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - The Stars Group Inc. (NASDAQ: TSG; TSX: TSGI) today announced that it successfully increased, repriced and extended its U.S. dollar and Euro denominated first lien term loans and revolving credit facility and amended and restated the applicable first lien term loan credit agreement. The Stars Group used approximately $95 million of the increased term loans to fully repay its existing higher-cost U.S. dollar denominated second lien term loan and intends to use approximately $250 million by the end of this month to fund a portion of the previously announced acquisition of an additional 18% equity interest in CrownBet Holdings Pty Limited and CrownBet's acquisition of William Hill Australia Holdings Pty Ltd. Unless otherwise noted, all references to \"$\" are to U.S. dollars and all references to \"€\" are to Euros.\nThe transactions included, among other things, an increase in the U.S. dollar and Euro denominated first lien term loans to $2.17 billion and €500 million, respectively, an extension of the respective maturity dates to April 6, 2025, and a decrease in pricing of 50 basis points to LIBOR plus 3.00% and Euribor plus 3.25%, respectively. The Stars Group's existing revolving credit facility was also increased from $100 million to $225 million and priced at LIBOR plus 2.75% with a new maturity date of April 6, 2023. The margin for the revolving credit facility is subject to leverage-based step-downs.\nThe Stars Group and the lenders also amended the credit agreement for its first lien term loans to, among other things, reflect the foregoing transactions and add certain operational and financial flexibility.\n\"The successful completion of this transaction not only underscores the strength of our current business and operations, as well as the continued support of our existing lenders and interest of new lenders, but also reinforces our strategy to enhance the capital structure of The Stars Group,\" said Brian Kyle, Chief Financial Officer of The Stars Group. \"The transactions will help reduce our currency risk, lower our effective interest rate, and allow us to successfully pursue and complete our growth initiatives.\"\nDeutsche Bank Securities Inc., Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc., Barclays and BMO Capital Markets were Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners for the amended first lien facilities.\nAbout The Stars Group\nThe Stars Group is a leading provider of technology-based products and services in the global gaming and interactive entertainment industries.
