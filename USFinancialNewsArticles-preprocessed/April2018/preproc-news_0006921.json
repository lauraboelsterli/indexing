    "text": "NEW YORK, April 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BeyondSpring Inc. (NASDAQ:BYSI), a global clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focusing on the development of innovative cancer therapies, today announced that the Company has filed its annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 03, 2018. The annual report can be accessed on the Company’s investor relations website at http://ir.beyondspringpharma.com .\nThe Company will provide a hard copy of its annual report containing its audited consolidated financial statements, free of charge, to its shareholders upon request. Requests should be directed to Investor Relations, BeyondSpring Inc., 28 Liberty Street, 39th Floor, New York, NY 10005 USA.\nAbout Plinabulin\nStudies on Plinabulin's method of action indicate that Plinabulin activates GEF-H1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor. GEF-H1 activates downstream transduction pathways leading to the activation of the protein c-Jun. Activated c-Jun enters the nucleus of dendritic cells to upregulate immune-related genes, which contributes to the up-regulation of a series of genes leading to dendritic cell maturation, T-cell activation and other effects that prevent neutropenia.\nAbout BeyondSpring\nBeyondSpring is a global, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative immuno-oncology cancer therapies with a robust pipeline from internal development and from collaboration with University of Washington in de novo drug discovery using ubiquitination platform. BeyondSpring’s lead asset, Plinabulin, is in a Phase 3 global clinical trial as a direct anticancer agent in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and two Phase 2/3 clinical programs in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN). BeyondSpring has a seasoned management team with many years of experience bringing drugs to the global market.\nContact:\nMedia Relations :\nCaitlin Kasunich / Amy Singh\nKCSA Strategic Communications\n212.896.1241 / 212.896.1207\nckasunich@kcsa.com / asingh@kcsa.com\nInvestor Relations:\nLaura Perry / Joseph Rayne\nArgot Partners\n212.600.1902\nBeyondSpring@argotpartners.com\nSource:BeyondSpring, Inc.",
