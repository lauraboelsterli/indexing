    "text": "CGG Launches First Lien Senior Secured Notes Offering\nPARIS, France - April 6, 2018\nAs the terms of the existing first lien senior secured notes due 2023 issued as part of the restructuring plan provide a window to refinance them at par, CGG S.A., the parent company of the CGG group, announces today that CGG Holding (U.S.) Inc., CGG's wholly-owned indirect subsidiary, has commenced an offering of first lien senior secured notes due 2023 in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $650 million in a USD-equivalent combination of dollars and euro. The notes will be guaranteed by CGG and certain of its subsidiaries.\nCGG Holding (U.S.) Inc. intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to redeem in full in accordance with their terms the entire outstanding principal amount of the existing first lien senior secured notes due 2023, issued in a principal amount of $663.6 million on February 21, 2018.\nFollowing the successful completion of the financial restructuring, CGG's Chief Financial Officer, St√©phane-Paul Frydman, has informed the company of his intention to step down. He will oversee the completion of the refinancing of the existing first lien senior notes and the publication of our first quarter 2018 results. The company has already launched the search for a new Chief Financial Officer.\nAbout CGG:\nCGG ( www.cgg.com ) is a fully integrated Geoscience company providing leading geological, geophysical and reservoir capabilities to its broad base of customers primarily from the global oil and gas industry.
