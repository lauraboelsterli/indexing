    "text": "ITASCA, Ill., April 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First Midwest Bancorp, Inc. (the \"Company\" or \"First Midwest\") (NASDAQ NGS:FMBI) , the holding company of First Midwest Bank (the \"Bank\"), today reported results of operations and financial condition for the first quarter of 2018. Net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $33.5 million, or $0.33 per share, compared to $2.3 million, or $0.02 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, and $22.9 million, or $0.23 per share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nReported results for the fourth quarter of 2017 were impacted by the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets (\"DTAs\") and various actions taken by the Company in light of federal income tax reform legislation. For the first quarter of 2017, reported results were impacted by acquisition and integration related expenses. For additional detail on these adjustments, see the \"Non-GAAP Financial Information\" section presented later in this release.\nEarnings per share, adjusted (1) was $0.33 for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $0.34 for both the fourth and the first quarters of 2017.\nSELECT FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS\nIncreased earnings per share to $0.33, up from $0.02 and $0.23 for the fourth and first quarters of 2017, respectively. Generated earnings per share, adjusted (1) of $0.33, down 3% from the fourth and first quarters of 2017. Higher provision expense impacted earnings per share by $0.05 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, reflective of loan growth and remediation costs specific to two isolated credits. Grew loans to $11 billion, up 9% annualized from December 31, 2017 and 6% from March 31, 2017. Maintained total average deposits at $11 billion, consistent with the fourth quarter of 2017 and up 3% from the first quarter of 2017; core deposit mix of 84%, consistent with both prior periods. Generated tax-equivalent net interest margin (1) of 3.80%; reflects declining loan accretion and a 3 basis point reduction due to federal income tax reform; excluding these items, underlying margin expanded 3 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and up 16 basis points from the first quarter of 2017. Lower noninterest income by 11% compared to the first quarter of 2017; up 6% from the first quarter of 2017, excluding the $4 million reclassification impact of recently adopted accounting guidance (2) , the impact of the Durbin Amendment effective in the third quarter of 2017, and net securities losses (1) . Controlled noninterest expenses, reporting an efficiency ratio (1) of 61%, consistent with the fourth and first quarters of 2017. Increased dividends per share to $0.11, up 10% and 22% from the fourth and first quarters of 2017, respectively.\n\"We had a solid start to the year,\" said Michael L. Scudder, Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. \"Operating performance for the quarter benefitted from strong earning asset growth and stable core funding and margins, combined with lower corporate income taxes. At the same time, comparatively higher credit provisioning weighed on the quarterâ€™s results, reflective of both the pace of loan growth and isolated credit remediation.\"\nMr. Scudder concluded, \"As we look ahead, progress continues on our \"Delivering Excellence\" initiative, our Company-wide effort to better align customer needs, technology, and processes with client experiences. These same efforts will also enhance operational efficiency and further improve the scalability of our platform. Continued successful execution combined with the strength of our capital and core funding will leave us well-positioned for further business expansion and improved operating performance.\"\n(1) These metrics are non-GAAP financial measures. For details on the calculation of these metrics, see the sections titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Information\" and \"Non-GAAP Reconciliations\" presented later in this release. (2) As a result of accounting guidance adopted in the first quarter of 2018, certain noninterest income line items and the related noninterest expense line items that are presented on a gross basis in prior periods are presented on a net basis in noninterest income for the current period.

As a result, interest income and yields on tax-exempt securities and loans subsequent to December 31, 2017 are presented using the current federal income tax rate of 21% and prior periods are presented using the federal income tax rate applicable at that time, or 35%. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded in income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income. See the \"Non-GAAP Financial Information\" section presented later in this release for a discussion of this non-GAAP financial measure. Net interest income for the first quarter of 2018 was consistent with the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased 2.9% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, net interest income benefited from the impact of higher interest rates and growth in loans and securities, offset by fewer days in the quarter, lower acquired loan accretion, and higher cost of funds. The rise in net interest income compared to the first quarter of 2017 was driven primarily by higher interest rates and loan growth, partially offset by lower acquired loan accretion and higher cost of funds.\nAcquired loan accretion contributed $5.1 million, $6.2 million, and $11.3 million to net interest income for the first quarter of 2018, the fourth quarter of 2017, and the first quarter of 2017, respectively.\nTax-equivalent net interest margin for the current quarter was 3.80%, decreasing 4 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017 and 9 basis points from the first quarter of 2017. Compared to both prior periods, tax-equivalent net interest margin was negatively impacted by a 3 basis points reduction in the tax-equivalent adjustment as a result of lower federal income tax rates. In addition, compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, the decrease in tax-equivalent net interest margin was impacted by a 4 basis point reduction in acquired loan accretion and higher cost of funds, mostly offset by the benefit of higher interest rates. The decrease in tax-equivalent net interest margin compared to the first quarter of 2017 was due to a 22 basis point decrease in acquired loan accretion partially offset by the positive impact of higher interest rates.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, total average interest-earning assets rose by $210.5 million from the fourth quarter of 2017 and $539.7 million from the first quarter of 2017. The increase compared to both prior periods resulted primarily from loan growth, which was partially offset by a reduction in other interest-earning assets. In addition, security purchases during the first quarter of 2018 contributed to the growth in total average interest-earning assets compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.\nTotal average funding sources for the first quarter of 2018 increased by $148.8 million from the fourth quarter of 2017 and $440.7 million from the first quarter of 2017. The increase compared to both prior periods resulted from an increase in FHLB advances and time deposits.\nNoninterest Income Analysis\n(Dollar amounts in thousands) Quarters Ended March 31, 2018\nPercent Change From March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 Service charges on deposit accounts $ 11,652 $ 12,289 $ 11,365 (5.2 ) 2.5 Wealth management fees 10,958 10,967 9,660 (0.1 ) 13.4 Card-based fees, net (1) : Card-based fees 5,692 6,052 8,116 (5.9 ) (29.9 ) Cardholder expenses (1,759 ) â€” â€” N/M N/M Card-based fees, net 3,933 6,052 8,116 (35.0 ) (51.5 ) Mortgage banking income 2,397 2,352 1,888 1.9 27.0 Capital market products income 1,558 1,986 1,376 (21.6 ) 13.2 Merchant servicing fees, net (1) : Merchant servicing fees 2,237 1,771 3,135 26.3 (28.6 ) Merchant card expenses (1,907 ) â€” â€” N/M N/M Merchant servicing fees, net 330 1,771 3,135 (81.4 ) (89.5 ) Other service charges, commissions, and fees 2,218 2,369 2,307 (6.4 ) (3.9 ) Other income 2,471 2,476 2,104 (0.2 ) 17.4 Net securities losses â€” (5,357 ) â€” (100.0 ) â€” Total noninterest income (1) $ 35,517 $ 34,905 $ 39,951 1.8 (11.1 )\nNoninterest Income, Excluding Net Securities Losses,\nthe Accounting Reclassification, and Durbin (2)\n(Dollar amounts in thousands) Quarters Ended March 31, 2018\nPercent Change From March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 Total noninterest income (1) $ 35,517 $ 34,905 $ 39,951 1.8 (11.1 ) Net securities losses â€” 5,357 â€” â€” â€” Reclassification impact of adopted accounting\nguidance (1) 3,666 â€” â€” N/M N/M Impact of the Durbin Amendment of the\nDodd-Frank Act (\"Durbin\") â€” â€” (2,900 ) â€” (100.0 ) Total noninterest income, excluding net\nsecurities losses, reclassification,\nand Durbin (2) $ 39,183 $ 40,262 $ 37,051 (2.7 ) 5.8 N/M â€“ Not meaningful.\n(1) As a result of accounting guidance adopted in the first quarter of 2018, certain noninterest income line items and the related noninterest expense line items that are presented on a gross basis for the prior periods are presented on a net basis in noninterest income for the current period. For further discussion of this guidance, see Note 2 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. (2) See the \"Non-GAAP Financial Information\" section presented later in this release for a discussion of this non-GAAP financial measure. Total noninterest income of $35.5 million was up 1.8% from the fourth quarter of 2017 and down 11.1% compared to the first quarter of 2017. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted accounting guidance which impacted how cardholder and merchant card expenses are presented within noninterest income on a prospective basis. As a result, these expenses are presented on a net basis against the related noninterest income for the first quarter of 2018 versus a gross basis within noninterest expense for the prior periods. In addition, Durbin became effective for the Company in the third quarter of 2017. Excluding net securities losses, the accounting reclassification, and Durbin, noninterest income was $39.2 million, down 2.7% from the fourth quarter of 2017 and up 5.8% from the first quarter of 2017.\nThe decrease in noninterest income compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 was impacted by a normal seasonal decline in service charges on deposit accounts and card-based fees. Capital market products income decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, which fluctuates from quarter to quarter based on the size and frequency of sales to commercial clients.\nNet card-based fees were up 8.4% compared to the first quarter of 2017, excluding the accounting reclassification and Durbin, due to higher transaction volumes. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, the increase in wealth management fees was driven primarily by the full quarter impact of customers acquired in the Premier Asset Management LLC (\"Premier\") transaction and organic growth. The decline in merchant servicing fees from the first quarter of 2017 reflected lower customer volumes, substantially offset by the decline in merchant card expense.\nMortgage banking income for the first quarter of 2018 resulted from sales of $63.8 million of 1-4 family mortgage loans in the secondary market, compared to $66.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $54.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. In addition, mortgage banking income for the first quarter of 2018 was positively impacted by changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, which fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nNet securities losses of $5.4 million were recognized during the fourth quarter of 2017 in connection with securities portfolio repositioning in light of federal income tax reform.\nNoninterest Expense Analysis\n(Dollar amounts in thousands) Quarters Ended March 31, 2018\nPercent Change From March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 Salaries and employee benefits: Salaries and wages $ 45,830 $ 48,204 $ 44,890 (4.9 ) 2.1 Retirement and other employee benefits 10,957 10,204 10,882 7.4 0.7 Total salaries and employee benefits 56,787 58,408 55,772 (2.8 ) 1.8 Net occupancy and equipment expense 13,773 12,826 12,325 7.4 11.7 Professional services 7,580 7,616 8,463 (0.5 ) (10.4 ) Technology and related costs 4,771 4,645 4,433 2.7 7.6 Advertising and promotions 1,650 4,083 1,066 (59.6 ) 54.8 Net other real estate owned (\"OREO\") expense 1,068 695 1,700 53.7 (37.2 ) Cardholder expenses (1) â€” 1,915 1,764 (100.0 ) (100.0 ) Merchant card expenses (1) â€” 1,423 2,585 (100.0 ) (100.0 ) Other expenses 9,953 10,715 9,969 (7.1 ) (0.2 ) Acquisition and integration related expenses â€” â€” 18,565 â€” (100.0 ) Total noninterest expense (1) $ 95,582 $ 102,326 $ 116,642 (6.6 ) (18.1 )\nNoninterest Expense, Adjusted, Excluding the Accounting Reclassification (2)\n(Dollar amounts in thousands) Quarters Ended March 31, 2018\nPercent Change From March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 Total noninterest expense (1) $ 95,582 $ 102,326 $ 116,642 (6.6 ) (18.1 ) Reclassification impact of adopted accounting\nguidance (1) 3,666 â€” â€” 100.0 100.0 Special bonus, charitable contribution â€” (3,515 ) â€” (100.0 ) â€” Acquisition and integration related expenses â€” â€” (18,565 ) â€” (100.0 ) Total noninterest expense, adjusted,\nexcluding the reclassification (2) $ 99,248 $ 98,811 $ 98,077 0.4 1.2\n(1) As a result of accounting guidance adopted in the first quarter of 2018, certain noninterest income line items and the related noninterest expense line items that are presented on a gross basis for the prior periods are presented on a net basis in noninterest income for the current period. For further discussion of this guidance, see Note 2 of \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. (2) See the \"Non-GAAP Financial Information\" section presented later in this release for a discussion of this non-GAAP financial measure. Total noninterest expense decreased by 6.6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and 18.1% compared to the first quarter of 2017. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted accounting guidance which impacted how cardholder and merchant card expenses are presented within noninterest income on a prospective basis. As a result, these expenses are presented on a net basis against the related noninterest income for the first quarter of 2018 versus a gross basis within noninterest expense for the prior periods. In addition, the fourth quarter of 2017 was impacted by a special bonus and charitable contribution in connection with federal income tax reform and the first quarter of 2017 was impacted by acquisition and integration related expenses that resulted from the acquisition of Standard Bancshares, Inc. (\"Standard\"). Noninterest expense, adjusted, excluding the accounting reclassification, for the first quarter of 2018 was $99.2 million, consistent with the fourth and first quarters of 2017.\nCompared to the fourth quarter of 2017, the decreases in salaries and wages and advertising and promotions expense were driven mainly by a special bonus and charitable contribution made during the fourth quarter of 2017. Net occupancy and equipment expense increased compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily as a result of higher costs related to winter weather conditions. The increase in net OREO expense resulted from net losses on sales of OREO properties compared to net gains on sales in the fourth quarter of 2017, partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses.\nThe increase in salaries and wages compared to the first quarter of 2017 was driven primarily by merit increases and organizational growth. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, net occupancy and equipment expenses increased as a result of higher costs related to winter weather conditions and the timing of expenses related to the Company's planned corporate headquarters relocation. Professional services expense declined compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to lower loan remediation expenses. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, the rise in advertising and promotions expense resulted from the timing of certain advertising costs. Net OREO expense decreased compared to the first quarter of 2017 as a result of lower levels of operating expenses, losses on sales, and valuation adjustments.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe Company's effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 22.6%, compared to 94.7% for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 32.0% for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in the effective tax rate from both prior periods was driven primarily by the reduction in the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% which became effective in the first quarter of 2018 as a result of federal income tax reform. In addition, the first quarter of 2018 was impacted by a $1.0 million income tax benefit related to employee share-based payments and the fourth quarter of 2017 was impacted by the downward revaluation of DTAs due to federal income tax reform.\nLOAN PORTFOLIO AND ASSET QUALITY\nLoan Portfolio Composition\n(Dollar amounts in thousands) As of March 31, 2018\nPercent Change From March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 Commercial and industrial $ 3,659,066 $ 3,529,914 $ 3,370,780 3.7 8.6 Agricultural 435,734 430,886 422,784 1.1 3.1 Commercial real estate: Office, retail, and industrial 1,931,202 1,979,820 1,988,979 (2.5 ) (2.9 ) Multi-family 695,830 675,463 671,710 3.0 3.6 Construction 585,766 539,820 568,460 8.5 3.0 Other commercial real estate 1,363,238 1,358,515 1,357,781 0.3 0.4 Total commercial real estate 4,576,036 4,553,618 4,586,930 0.5 (0.2 ) Total corporate loans 8,670,836 8,514,418 8,380,494 1.8 3.5 Home equity 881,534 827,055 880,667 6.6 0.1 1-4 family mortgages 798,902 774,357 540,148 3.2 47.9 Installment 325,502 321,982 253,061 1.1 28.6 Total consumer loans 2,005,938 1,923,394 1,673,876 4.3 19.8 Total loans $ 10,676,774 $ 10,437,812 $ 10,054,370 2.3 6.2 Total loans of $10.7 billion increased by 9.3%, annualized from December 31, 2017 and 6.2% from March 31, 2017. Compared to both prior periods, growth in commercial and industrial loans, primarily within our sector-based lending businesses, multi-family, and construction loans drove the rise in total corporate loans.\nGrowth in consumer loans compared to both prior periods benefited from the impact of purchases of shorter-duration home equity loans and organic production. Compared to March 31, 2017, growth in consumer loans also benefited from certain purchases of 1-4 family mortgages and installment loans.\nAsset Quality\n(Dollar amounts in thousands) As of March 31, 2018\nPercent Change From March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 Asset quality Non-accrual loans $ 75,015 $ 66,924 $ 54,294 12.1 38.2 90 days or more past due loans, still accruing\ninterest (1) 4,633 3,555 2,633 30.3 76.0 Total non-performing loans 79,648 70,479 56,927 13.0 39.9 Accruing troubled debt restructurings\n(\"TDRs\") 1,778 1,796 2,112 (1.0 ) (15.8 ) OREO 17,472 20,851 29,140 (16.2 ) (40.0 ) Total non-performing assets $ 98,898 $ 93,126 $ 88,179 6.2 12.2 30-89 days past due loans (1) $ 42,573 $ 39,725 $ 23,641 Non-accrual loans to total loans 0.70 % 0.64 % 0.54 % Non-performing loans to total loans 0.75 % 0.68 % 0.57 % Non-performing assets to total loans plus\nOREO 0.92 % 0.89 % 0.87 % Allowance for credit losses Allowance for credit losses $ 95,854 $ 96,729 $ 89,163 Allowance for credit losses to total loans (2) 0.90 % 0.93 % 0.89 % Allowance for credit losses to loans, excluding\nacquired loans 1.01 % 1.07 % 1.11 % Allowance for credit losses to non-accrual\nloans 127.78 % 144.54 % 164.22 %\n(1) Purchased credit impaired loans with an accretable yield are considered current and are not included in past due loan totals. (2) This ratio includes acquired loans that are recorded at fair value through an acquisition adjustment, which incorporates credit risk as of the acquisition date with no allowance for credit losses being established at that time. As the acquisition adjustment is accreted into income over future periods, an allowance for credit losses on acquired loans is established as necessary to reflect credit deterioration. Total non-performing assets represented 0.92% of total loans and OREO at March 31, 2018, up from 0.89% and 0.87% at December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively, reflective of normal fluctuations that can occur on a quarterly basis.\nThe allowance for credit losses to total loans was 0.90% at March 31, 2018, compared to 0.93% at December 31, 2017 and consistent with March 31, 2017.\nCharge-Off Data\n(Dollar amounts in thousands) Quarters Ended March 31,\n2018 % of\nTotal December 31,\n2017 % of\nTotal March 31,\n2017 % of\nTotal Net loan charge-offs (1) Commercial and industrial $ 13,149 81.9 $ 5,635 79.3 $ 1,894 66.8 Agricultural 983 6.1 (102 ) (1.4 ) 514 18.1 Office, retail, and industrial 364 2.3 (78 ) (1.1 ) (848 ) (29.9 ) Multi-family â€” â€” (3 ) â€” (28 ) (1.0 ) Construction (13 ) (0.1 ) (12 ) (0.2 ) (222 ) (7.8 ) Other commercial real estate 30 0.2 (5 ) (0.1 ) 307 10.8 Consumer 1,543 9.6 1,674 23.5 1,221 43.0 Total net loan charge-offs $ 16,056 100.0 $ 7,109 100.0 $ 2,838 100.0 Total recoveries included above $ 1,029 $ 2,011 $ 3,440 Net loan charge-offs to average loans: Quarter-to-date (1) 0.62 % 0.27 % 0.12 % (1) Amounts represent charge-offs, net of recoveries. Net loan charge-offs to average loans, annualized were 0.62%, up from 0.27% and 0.12% for the fourth and first quarters of 2017, respectively. The increase in net loan charge-offs compared to both prior periods resulted largely from expected losses on two corporate relationships based upon circumstances unique to these borrowers. Included within net charge-offs for the first quarter of 2017 were $3.4 million in recoveries which related to three corporate relationships that were charged-off in prior periods.\nDEPOSIT PORTFOLIO\nDeposit Composition\n(Dollar amounts in thousands) Average for the Quarters Ended March 31, 2018\nPercent Change From March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 Demand deposits $ 3,466,832 $ 3,611,811 $ 3,355,674 (4.0 ) 3.3 Savings deposits 2,015,679 2,017,489 2,029,631 (0.1 ) (0.7 ) NOW accounts 1,992,672 1,992,150 1,916,816 â€” 4.0 Money market accounts 1,814,057 1,938,195 1,890,703 (6.4 ) (4.1 ) Core deposits 9,289,240 9,559,645 9,192,824 (2.8 ) 1.0 Time deposits 1,735,155 1,619,758 1,515,597 7.1 14.5 Total deposits $ 11,024,395 $ 11,179,403 $ 10,708,421 (1.4 ) 3.0 Average core deposits of $9.3 billion for the first quarter of 2018 decreased by 2.8% from the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased 1.0% compared to the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in average core deposits compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 resulted primarily from the normal seasonal decline in commercial and municipal deposits. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, the rise in average core deposits was driven by organic growth. The increase in average time deposits compared to both prior periods was primarily driven by the continued success of promotions started in 2017.\nCAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nCapital Ratios As of March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 Company regulatory capital ratios: Total capital to risk-weighted assets 12.07 % 12.15 % 11.48 % Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 10.07 % 10.10 % 9.53 % Common equity Tier 1 (\"CET1\") to risk-weighted assets 9.65 % 9.68 % 9.11 % Tier 1 capital to average assets 9.07 % 8.99 % 8.89 % Company tangible common equity ratios (1)(2): Tangible common equity to tangible assets 8.18 % 8.33 % 8.07 % Tangible common equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (\"AOCI\"), to tangible assets 8.60 % 8.58 % 8.38 % Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets 9.18 % 9.31 % 8.68 %\n(1) These ratios are not subject to formal Federal Reserve regulatory guidance. (2) Tangible common equity (\"TCE\") represents common stockholders' equity less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. For details of the calculation of these ratios, see the sections titled, \"Non-GAAP Financial Information\" and \"Non-GAAP Reconciliations\" presented later in this release. Overall, the Company's regulatory capital ratios decreased compared to December 31, 2017, due primarily to the impact of loan growth on risk-weighted assets and the nearly 10 basis point impact of the phase-in of certain provisions related to regulatory capital ratio calculations, substantially offset by an increase in retained earnings. Compared to March 31, 2017, the Company's regulatory capital ratios benefited from the full-year impact of retained earnings and certain actions taken by management in the fourth quarter of 2017 to sell all of its $46 million in trust-preferred collateralized debt obligations, partially offset by loan growth and the phase-in of certain provisions.\nThe Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per common share during the first quarter of 2018, which is a 10% increase from the fourth quarter of 2017 and will represent the 141 st consecutive cash dividend paid by the Company since its inception in 1983.\nConference Call\nA conference call to discuss the Company's results, outlook, and related matters will be held on Wednesday, April 25, 2018 at 11:00 A.M.

In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \"may,\" \"might,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"expect,\" \"plan,\" \"intend,\" \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"outlook,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"probable,\" \"potential,\" \"possible,\" \"target,\" \"continue,\" \"look forward,\" or \"assume\" and words of similar import. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts but instead express only management's beliefs regarding future results or events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of management's control. It is possible that actual results and events may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results or events indicated in these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and First Midwest cautions you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this press release, and First Midwest undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this press release to reflect new information or events or conditions after the date hereof.\nForward-looking statements may be deemed to include, among other things, statements relating to our future financial performance, including the related outlook for 2018, the performance of our loan or securities portfolio, the expected amount of future credit reserves or charge-offs, corporate strategies or objectives, including the impact of certain actions and initiatives, anticipated trends in our business, regulatory developments, the impact of federal income tax reform legislation, acquisition transactions, including estimated synergies, cost savings and financial benefits of consummated transactions, and growth strategies, including possible future acquisitions. These statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, you should refer to the sections entitled \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, as well as our subsequent filings made However, these risks and uncertainties are not exhaustive. Other sections of such reports describe additional factors that could adversely impact our business and financial performance.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThe Company's accounting and reporting policies conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") and general practices within the banking industry. As a supplement to GAAP, the Company provides non-GAAP performance results, which the Company believes are useful because they assist investors in assessing the Company's operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures include earnings per share (\"EPS\"), adjusted, the efficiency ratio, total return on average assets, adjusted, tax-equivalent net interest income (including its individual components), tax-equivalent net interest margin, tax-equivalent net interest margin, adjusted, noninterest income, excluding net securities losses, the accounting reclassification, and Durbin, noninterest expense, adjusted, excluding the accounting reclassification, effective income tax rate, excluding revaluations of DTAs, tangible common equity to tangible assets, tangible common equity, excluding AOCI, to tangible assets, tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets, return on average tangible common equity, and return on average tangible common equity, adjusted.\nThe Company presents EPS, the efficiency ratio, return on average assets, and return on average tangible common equity, all adjusted for certain significant transactions. These transaction include the revaluation of DTAs (fourth and third quarters of 2017), certain actions resulting in securities losses and gains (fourth and third quarters of 2017), a special bonus to colleagues (fourth quarter of 2017), a charitable contribution to the First Midwest Charitable Foundation (fourth quarter of 2017), and acquisition and integration related expenses associated with completed and pending acquisitions (first, second, and third quarters of 2017). Management believes excluding these transactions from EPS, the efficiency ratio, return on average assets, and return on average tangible common equity is useful in assessing the Company's underlying operational performance since these transactions do not pertain to its core business operations and their exclusion facilitates better comparability between periods. Management believes that excluding acquisition and integration related expenses from these metrics is useful to the Company, as well as analysts and investors, since these expenses can vary significantly based on the size, type, and structure of each acquisition. Additionally, management believes excluding these transactions from these metrics enhances comparability for peer comparison purposes.\nThe Company presents noninterest income, excluding net securities losses, the accounting reclassification, and Durbin and noninterest expense, adjusted, excluding the accounting reclassification. Management believes that excluding these items from noninterest income and noninterest expense is useful in assessing the Companyâ€™s underlying operational performance as these items either do not pertain to its core business operations or their exclusion facilitates better comparability between periods and for peer comparison purposes.\nThe tax-equivalent adjustment to net interest income and net interest margin recognizes the income tax savings when comparing taxable and tax-exempt assets. Interest income and yields on tax-exempt securities and loans subsequent to December 31, 2017 are presented using the current federal income tax rate of 21% and prior periods are computed using the federal income tax rate applicable at that time, or 35%. Management believes that it is standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest income and net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis and that it enhances comparability for peer comparison purposes. In addition, management believes that presenting tax-equivalent net interest margin, adjusted, enhances comparability for peer comparison purposes and is useful to the Company, as well as analysts and investors, since acquired loan accretion income may fluctuate based on the size of each acquisition, as well as from period to period.\nIn management's view, tangible common equity measures are capital adequacy metrics meaningful to the Company, as well as analysts and investors, in assessing the Company's use of equity and in facilitating comparisons with peers. These non-GAAP measures are valuable indicators of a financial institution's capital strength since they eliminate intangible assets from stockholders' equity and retain the effect of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity.\nAlthough intended to enhance investors' understanding of the Company's business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. See the previously provided tables and the following reconciliations in the \"Non-GAAP Reconciliations\" section for details on the calculation of these measures to the extent presented herein.\nAbout the Company\nFirst Midwest is a relationship-focused financial institution and one of the largest independent publicly-traded bank holding companies based on assets headquartered in the Midwest, with over $14 billion in assets and approximately $11 billion in trust assets under management.

Annualized based on the actual number of days for each period presented. Presented on a tax-equivalent basis, assuming the applicable federal income tax rate for each period presented. As a result, interest income and yields on tax-exempt securities and loans subsequent to December 31, 2017 are presented using the current federal income tax rate of 21% and prior periods are computed using the federal income tax rate applicable at that time, or 35%. Cost of funds expresses total interest expense as a percentage of average total funding sources. This measure excludes the impact of revaluation of DTAs related to federal tax reform and changes in Illinois income tax rates for the fourth and third quarter of 2017. This ratio includes acquired loans that are recorded at fair value through an acquisition adjustment, which incorporates credit risk, as of the acquisition date with no allowance for credit losses being established at that time. As the acquisition adjustment is accreted into income over future periods, an allowance for credit losses is established on acquired loans as necessary to reflect credit deterioration. Adjustments to net income for the fourth and third quarters of 2017 include revaluation of DTAs related to federal income tax reform and changes in Illinois income tax rates, a special colleague bonus, a charitable contribution, and certain actions related to the securities portfolio. In addition, net income for certain periods was adjusted for acquisition and integration related expenses associated with completed and pending acquisitions. For additional discussion of adjustments, see the \"Non-GAAP Financial Information\" section. Presented as calculated prior to March 31, 2018, which included a tax-equivalent adjustment for BOLI. Management believes that removing this adjustment from the current calculation of this metric enhances comparability for peer comparison purposes.\nFirst Midwest Bancorp, Inc.
