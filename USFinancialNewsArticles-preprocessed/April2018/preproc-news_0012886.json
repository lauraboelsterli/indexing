    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. soldiers died in a helicopter crash during training at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, the Army said on Saturday, marking the fourth U.S. military aircraft mishap in less than a week. \nThe crew of the AH-64E Apache helicopter were conducting routine training exercises when the crash occurred on Friday night, according to an Army statement posted to Fort Campbell’s Facebook page. \nThe solders, both from the 101st Airborne Division, were not identified. The Army said the incident was under investigation. \n“This is a day of sadness for Fort Campbell and the 101st Airborne,” Brigadier General Todd Royar, acting senior commander of the 101st Airborne Division and Fort Campbell, said in the Facebook statement. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the families during this difficult time.” \nThe crash is the latest in a series of similar incidents involving U.S. military aircraft that began on Tuesday. \nA U.S. Marine Corps helicopter crashed during training in Southern California on Tuesday. All four members were believed to be killed. \nA Marine jet also crashed in Djibouti on Tuesday. The pilot was later reported in stable condition. \nOn Wednesday, a U.S. Air Force pilot with the traveling Thunderbirds exhibition squad died when his F-16 fighter jet crashed in Nevada. \nReporting by David Morgan\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
