In his new role at AdvancedMD, he will ensure superior claims processing through innovation and automation, backed by white glove client support.\n“Independent practices are looking for an RCM partner they can trust who has the experience and insight to get them paid quickly,” said Raul Villar, CEO at AdvancedMD. “John is here to help relieve the burden of reimbursement, particularly under value based care, so physicians can focus on patients.”\nPreviously, Marron was Vice President of business development and product management for Gateway EDI, expanding its software and technology services division from the ground up. Marron also was responsible for assisting with the Gateway EDI acquisition by TriZetto Provider Solutions (a Cognizant Co.), as well as other acquisitions for the new company.\nMost recently, Marron served as CEO of inMediata Health Group, Charlotte, NC, focusing on leveraging technology to reconcile payments, remittances and deposits, and delivery of innovative solutions to reimbursement challenges. There, he improved operational efficiencies, accelerated business growth, and transformed the culture of people development while also bringing to market several new innovative RCM products.\nPreviously, Marron gained deep payer experience during 10 years at Aetna, NYSE: AET where he led the team supporting electronic transactions with their provider network, achieving millions of dollars in savings each year.\n“Maximizing revenue collections for our practice clients requires a deep understanding of what payers need, to process claims quickly and accurately,” Marron explained. “I’m committed to applying our technology and expertise to ensure our clients get paid for their efforts to keep patients healthy.”\nAlso joining the AdvancedMD RCM leadership team reporting to Marron is Greg O’Neil, Director of RCM Operations who is the former Operations Team Director for Intermountain Healthcare Revenue Cycle. “Greg is a very progressive leader for revenue cycle. He brings EDI and claims processing expertise and has a great sense for cross-functional cooperation. I’m excited for Greg’s ability to produce exceptional service and bottom line results for our clients,” said Marron.\nMarron holds a Master’s degree in Business Administration from Temple University, Philadelphia, Pa.
