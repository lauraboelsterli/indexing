FILE PHOTO: Interserve offices are seen in Twyford, Britain January 17, 2018. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\nInterserve, which warned in October that it may breach covenants, said new facilities will provide cash facilities 196.6 million pounds and bonding facilities of up to 94.5 million pounds, maturing Sept. 2021.\nThe outsourcer said it will issue warrants to the providers of the cash and bonding facilities with the right to subscribe for new shares at 10 pence per share.\nThere has been increased focus on outsourcing firms such as Interserve since rival Carillion ( CLLN.L ) entered liquidation in January, putting 43,000 jobs at risk.
