    "text": "CHICAGO, April 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- GTCR, a leading private equity firm, announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement to sell Callcredit Information Group Limited (\"Callcredit\" or the \"Company\") to TransUnion (NYSE: TRU) for £1.0 billion in cash consideration.\nFounded in 2000, Callcredit is the second largest credit reference agency in the UK with over 3,000 customers, including the UK's largest financial institutions and organizations in the alternative lending, insurance, telecom, utilities and public sectors, among others. The Company's innovative data solutions and software and analytics services enable real-time credit reporting and scoring, multi-bureau decisioning analysis, loan affordability assessments, customer account monitoring and management, and fraud protection and identify verification. In addition, Callcredit provides free access to credit reports and scores to consumers to help them manage their finances and offers protection against fraud and identity theft.\nSince GTCR's acquisition of Callcredit in 2014, the Company has experienced a significant transformation driven by GTCR's partnership with a management team led by CEO Mike Gordon, who was recruited by GTCR and joined in 2014. Over the past several years, Callcredit has established itself as a market leader through product innovation, expansion of fraud protection and identity verification capabilities, and material investments in technology and systems to enhance security and resilience. During the same period, Callcredit completed three acquisitions to support its organic expansion efforts.\n\"GTCR is proud to have supported Callcredit's remarkable transformation and growth over the last few years,\" said GTCR Managing Director Collin Roche. \"Callcredit enhanced its capabilities and product offerings, added several new clients, and deepened its long-standing relationships with existing clients while maintaining its agility and customer-centric culture that have underpinned its success to date. We believe the Company is well-positioned to continue its growth as part of TransUnion.\"\nAaron Cohen, Managing Director at GTCR, added: \"This transaction marks another successful example of GTCR's Leaders Strategy™. Mike Gordon and the entire Callcredit team have built a truly remarkable company by investing in people and technology, resulting in strong growth and exceptional customer service. On behalf of GTCR, we'd like to extend our thanks and best wishes to the entire management team and employees at Callcredit as they continue their journey with TransUnion.\"\n\"We'd like to thank GTCR for their commitment and support in transforming Callcredit over the past several years,\" said Mike Gordon. \"GTCR has been a great partner, and extremely supportive of the investments made to drive long-term growth. We look forward to working with TransUnion to continue delivering innovative solutions to our customers.\"\nThe transaction is anticipated to close late in the second quarter or early in the third quarter pending regulatory approval.\nJefferies International Limited and Credit Suisse served as Callcredit's financial advisors. Evercore also acted as a joint financial advisor and Kirkland & Ellis LLP provided legal counsel.\nAbout GTCR\nFounded in 1980, GTCR is a leading private equity firm focused on investing in growth companies in the Financial Services & Technology, Healthcare, Technology, Media & Telecommunications and Growth Business Services industries.
