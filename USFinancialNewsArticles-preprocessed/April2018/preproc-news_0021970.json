    "text": "1 COMMENTS IN 1963, when style-conscious moms were whipping up chicken a la king and chiffon pies in trendy turquoise kitchens, Kenner’s Easy- Bake Oven debuted in the same postwar hue. The 1969 model followed in au courant avocado. But as real kitchens shifted to neutrals like almond and white, their toy counterparts failed to keep pace.\n“At some point, society decided children want only bright, colorful, highly-rounded shapes,” said Barry Kudrowitz, toy designer and associate professor of product design at the University of Minnesota. Hence, mountains of garish, plastic playthings that crowd closets and landfills.\nRecently, however, companies began producing sophisticated mini-me kitchens. IKEA’s minimalist birch-plywood and white-fiberboard design features “stainless” hardware and a flat cooktop whose elements glow red. Milton & Goose’s setup comes in gray, birch and maple, with a white farmhouse sink many adults will covet. Teamson Kids’ deep green rig emulates a traditional Provence kitchen.\nBeyond not affronting parents’ tastes, these imitations educate well. “The more a play kitchen looks like a tiny version of the one mom or dad uses, [the more] it helps children develop symbolic understanding, an important marker for language development,” said Sarah Lytle, outreach director at the Institute for Learning & Brain Sciences at the University of Washington. And when was the last time you cooked a meal on a pink and purple range with glitter-detailed knobs?\nFrom left: Duktig Play Kitchen, $99, ikea.com; Little Chef Provence Retro Play Kitchen, $179, teamson.com\nMore in Design & Decorating\nDécor Challenge: Can Eastern and Western Styles Coexist?
