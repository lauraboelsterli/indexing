    "text": "SAN DIEGO, April 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) today announced that Qualcomm River Holdings B.V., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Qualcomm, has extended the offering period of its previously announced cash tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding common shares of NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NASDAQ: NXPI). The tender offer is being made pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, dated as of October 27, 2016, by and between Qualcomm River Holdings B.V. and NXP, as amended (the \"Purchase Agreement\"). The tender offer is now scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on April 6, 2018, unless extended or earlier terminated, in either case pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement.\nAmerican Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, the depositary for the tender offer, has advised Qualcomm River Holdings B.V. that as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 29, 2018, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the extension of the offer, 50,848,182 NXP common shares (excluding 21,239 shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee), representing approximately 14.8% of the outstanding NXP common shares, have been validly tendered pursuant to the tender offer and not properly withdrawn. Shareholders who have already tendered their common shares of NXP do not have to re-tender their shares or take any other action as a result of the extension of the expiration date of the tender offer.\nCompletion of the tender offer remains subject to additional conditions described in the tender offer statement on Schedule TO filed by Qualcomm River Holdings B.V. with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on November 18, 2016, as amended (the \"Schedule TO\"). The tender offer will continue to be extended until all conditions are satisfied or waived, or until the tender offer is terminated, in either case pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement by and between Qualcomm River Holdings B.V. and NXP and as described in the Schedule TO.\nUnder the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (\"HSR\"), regulatory approval to complete a transaction expires one year after HSR clearance is obtained. The previously-received clearance for this transaction was set to expire on April 3, 2018. As a result, on March 30, 2018 NXP re-filed, and on April 2, 2018 Qualcomm is re-filing, the required paperwork with the Federal Trade Commission to receive a new clearance. The parties expect to receive this clearance shortly.\nInnisfree M&A Incorporated is acting as information agent for Qualcomm River Holdings B.V. in the tender offer. Requests for documents and questions regarding the tender offer may be directed to Innisfree M&A Incorporated by telephone, toll-free at (888) 750-5834 for shareholders, or collect at (212) 750-5833 for banks and brokers.\nAbout Qualcomm\nQualcomm invents breakthrough technologies that transform how the world connects and communicates.
