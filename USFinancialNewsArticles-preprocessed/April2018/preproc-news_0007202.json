    "text": "FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX), the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide, today announced that its Board of Directors has raised the amount of its quarterly dividend by 25% from the last dividend paid. The Board declared a regular quarterly dividend in the amount of $.39 per share, payable June 7, 2018, to shareholders of record on May 17, 2018.\nErnie Herrman, Chief Executive Officer and President of The TJX Companies, Inc., stated, “I am pleased to report that our Board of Directors has approved a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend. This marks our 22 nd consecutive year of dividend increases. Over this period, the Company’s dividend has grown at a compound annual rate of 23%. In addition, we plan to increase our share buyback program, with approximately $2.5 to $3.0 billion of repurchases planned for Fiscal 2019. TJX continues to generate tremendous amounts of cash and excellent financial returns. Further, we are expecting a substantial cash benefit as a result of the recent changes in U.S. federal tax law, which is reflected in our plan to significantly increase our dividend and share buyback programs. These actions underscore our confidence in our ability to continue delivering profitable sales and strong cash flow that enables us to simultaneously reinvest in the growth of the business and return value to our shareholders.”\nAbout The TJX Companies, Inc.\nThe TJX Companies, Inc. is the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide.
