    "text": "(Reuters) - Xerox Corp ( XRX.N ) and Fujifilm Holdings ( 4901.T ) are in active talks to renegotiate a deal the two struck in January, CNBC reported, citing comments made by the companies’ lawyers at a court hearing on Thursday.\nA man is silhouetted in front of Fujifilm Holdings' logo ahead of its news conference in Tokyo, Japan January 31, 2018. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon The $6.1 billion deal, which would combine Xerox into an existing joint venture with Fuji, has been opposed by the printer copier maker’s top shareholders Darwin Deason and activist investor Carl Icahn, saying it unfairly favors Fuji.\nOn Tuesday, Icahn and Deason suggested alternatives to the merger including a plan for the U.S. company to monetize some assets. [nL3N1RU5P5]\nBoth Fujifilm and Xerox were not immediately available for comments.\nReporting by Laharee Chatterjee in Bengaluru\n 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
