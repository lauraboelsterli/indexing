    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Helios and Matheson Analytics Inc. (Nasdaq: HMNY) (“HMNY”), a provider of information technology services and solutions and the 92% owner of MoviePass Inc. (“MoviePass”), the nation’s premier movie-theater subscription service, today announced the pricing of a best efforts underwritten public offering of an aggregate of 10,500,000 Series A-2 units (the “Series A-2 Units”), with each Series A-2 Unit consisting of (i) one share of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”), and (ii) one Series A-2 Warrant to purchase one share of Common Stock (the “Series A-2 Warrants”); and 500,000 Series B-2 units (the “Series B-2 Units”, and together with the Series A-2 Units, the “Units”), with each Series B-2 Unit consisting of (i) one pre-funded Series B-2 Warrant to purchase one share of Common Stock (the “Series B-2 Warrants”, and together with the Series A-2 Warrants, the “Warrants”) and (ii) one Series A-2 Warrant, with anticipated gross proceeds of approximately $30 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by HMNY. HMNY is offering the Units at a price of $2.75 per Unit. All of the Units are being offered by HMNY. The shares of common stock and warrants will be issued separately. The Warrants will be exercisable at any time on or after the issuance date until the five-year anniversary of the issuance date. Each Series A-2 Warrant will be exercisable at a price of $3.00 per share of common stock. Each Series B-2 Warrant will have an aggregate exercise price of $2.75 per share of common stock, all of which will be pre-funded except for a nominal exercise price of $0.001 per share of common stock. There is no established public trading market for the Warrants and HMNY does not expect a market to develop in the future. The offering is expected to close on or about April 23, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.

The Company may also use the proceeds to make other acquisitions.\nThis press release features multimedia.
