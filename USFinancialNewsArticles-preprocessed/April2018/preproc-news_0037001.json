National Capital Region Police Director Oscar Albayalde gestures during an interview with Reuters in Taguig City June 6, 2017. Picture taken June 6, 2017. To match Special Report PHILIPPINES-DUTERTE/DOA REUTERS/Dondi Tawatao \nThe job of national police chief was given to Oscar Albayalde, a strict disciplinarian who has been in charge of Metro Manila, where the vast majority of the thousands of drugs war killings have occurred. \nHe was succeeded as commander of the capital police by Camilo Cascolan, the architect of the controversial operational plan of the anti-drug campaign, “Double Barrel”. \nAbout 4,100 people have been killed by police in the Philippines since July 2016 in what the authorities said were shootouts during anti-narcotics operations. At least 2,300 drug-related deaths have occurred separately, at the hands of what police say are unknown assassins. \nHuman rights groups believe the death toll has been understated, and accuse the authorities of executing suspects and staging crime scenes. Police deny that and say their more than 130,000 arrests prove their intent to preserve life. \nCascolan is the latest officer promoted to a top command post having served in the Davao region during the 22 years Duterte was a mayor there. The outgoing police chief, Ronald dela Rosa, also served in Davao. \nCascolan’s position as head of operations will go to Mao Aplasca, also from the Davao region. \nAlbayalde vowed no relent in the campaign and to ensure continuity of its “remarkable accomplishments”, including arresting or convincing tens of thousands of people to surrender, and the “neutralising” of drug suspects. \n“We will not relent on our war against illegal drugs and other forms of criminality. The drug menace, we must all understand, is a worldwide phenomenon,” Albayalde said in a speech. \n“We will help and support each other to fight and win this war.” \nThe outgoing police chief, Dela Rosa, will head the bureau of corrections. \nHe is leaving behind a police force with “a sordid human rights record”, according to Carlos Conde, a researcher for the New York based Human Rights Watch. \nIn his departure speech, Dela Rosa lauded Duterte’s for his courage to order an all-out war on drugs, and pledged his “unquestionable loyalty” to him. \n“It was an order I certainly could not refuse. I shared the same sentiments as the president and would not let pass the opportunity to do my share,” he said. Additional reporting by Neil Jerome Morales and Martin Petty; Editing by Robert Birsel",
