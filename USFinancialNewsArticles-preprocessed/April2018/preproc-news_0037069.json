    "text": "MOSCOW, April 16 (Reuters) - Russia’s central bank plans to issue new bonds in May with eased pricing restrictions, Igor Dmitriev, the regulator’s head of monetary policy, said on Monday.\nDmitriev said the issue conditions would increase the appeal of the central bank’s OBR bonds and help withdraw excess liquidity from the market.\nThe central bank borrows roubles from the market by selling OBR bonds in order to absorb excessive liquidity from the banking sector.\nReporting by Elena Fabrichnaya; writing by Jack Stubbs; Editing by Maria Kiselyova\n ",
