    "text": "PITTSBURGH, April 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) President & Chief Executive Officer David B. Burritt announced two changes to the company’s executive team. Duane Holloway will be joining the company to serve as Senior Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Corporate Secretary. Richard L. Fruehauf, who has been serving as Interim General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer, will become Vice President of Strategic Planning and Corporate Development. Holloway and Fruehauf will report to Burritt.\nHolloway will have executive responsibility for all legal and compliance matters at the company and serve as Corporate Secretary. Of Holloway, Burritt said, \"Duane joins us with a proven track record of leadership excellence while working for some of the world’s most recognizable brands. His approach to corporate law is grounded in collaboration and a belief that in-house counsel should safeguard the company’s interests while also working within the law to develop solutions that address critical business priorities. Throughout his career, he has developed and executed sound legal, governance, and compliance strategies that enabled his previous companies to successfully navigate challenging legal issues. These experiences and perspectives, coupled with extensive prior involvement in corporate transformation initiatives, make Duane a great fit for this critical role.”\nBefore joining U. S. Steel, Holloway served as Executive Vice President and General Counsel for Ascena Retail Group, where he integrated multiple legal teams into one group and led the company’s litigation management process and integrated transformation program. Holloway also served as Vice President and Deputy General Counsel for CoreLogic, Inc., and Senior Vice President and Chief Counsel, Operations and Litigation for Caesars Entertainment Corporation. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology from the University of Virginia. He is also a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania School of Law.\nFruehauf will be responsible for the following functions that are important to the next phase of the company’s transformation: Strategic Planning and Business Development, Innovation, Governmental Affairs, Environmental Affairs and Sustainability and Corporate Communications. “Rich has been a valuable contributor since joining our company,” Burritt said. “His background and broad legal experience have contributed to several important financial and strategic projects, as well as to the enhancement of our environmental compliance and sustainability programs. He has been an important advisor to me while serving as Interim General Counsel during the last four months, and I look forward to working with him in this new, challenging and important capacity.”\nBefore arriving at U. S. Steel in 2014, Fruehauf held increasingly responsible roles at Westinghouse Electric Company and Alcoa. He also practiced law with Cohen & Grigsby, P.C. in Pittsburgh and Covington & Burling in Washington, D.C. Earlier in his career, he served in a number of national security positions with the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Arms Control & Disarmament Agency, and the Department of the Navy. Fruehauf holds a Bachelor of Science degree from Georgetown University, a Master of Public Policy degree from Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government, and received his law degree from the University of Virginia School of Law.\nUnited States Steel Corporation, headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pa., is a leading integrated steel producer and Fortune 300 company with major operations in the United States and Central Europe.
