    "text": "HOUSTON (Reuters) - Offshore rig operator Borr Drilling ( BDRILL.OL ) cut 66 jobs in Texas at the end of March, according to a state regulatory notice, as the company prepared to close on its purchase of Paragon Offshore.\nThe filing with the Texas Workforce Commission did not provide a reason for the layoffs.\nA Borr representative was not immediately available for comment.\nBorr, based in Oslo, Norway, offered to buy rival Paragon Offshore for $232.5 million in February and Paragon shareholders approved the deal on March 27. Borr’s chief executive officer left the company last month, citing the acquisition of Paragon.\nReporting by Liz Hampton; Editing by Richard Chang\n 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
