Pope Francis holds a candle as he leads the Easter vigil mass in Saint Peter's Basilica at the Vatican, March 31, 2018. REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini \nThe baptism took place during a long Holy Saturday, or Easter eve, Mass for some 10,000 people in St. Peter’s Basilica. \nThe church, the largest in Christendom, was dark at the start of the service before lights were turned on, signifying the passage from darkness to light when the Bible says Jesus rose from the dead. \nThe pope traditionally welcomes new members of the Church during the Saturday night service.

REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini \nThis year, among those he baptised was John Ogah, 31, who Italian newspapers last year dubbed the “migrant hero” and held up as an example of bravery and good citizenship. \nOgah was begging for change outside a supermarket in a Rome neighbourhood where many migrants live last September when he stopped a 37-year-old Italian who had just held up the store with a cleaver and was getting away with about 400 euros, according to the Catholic television station TV2000. Slideshow (10 Images) \nThe Nigerian, who did not have permission to stay in Italy, held the man down until police arrived and then left the scene, fearing it would be discovered he did not have documents, according to La Repubblica newspaper. \nPolice using footage from surveillance cameras tracked him down and rewarded him by helping him get legal permission to stay in the country. \nAn Italian Carabinieri police captain who worked in the neighbourhood, Nunzio Carbone, was his godfather, or sponsor, at Saturday’s baptism service. \nCarbone and his fellow policemen helped Ogah get his immigration papers. The Nigerian now works as a stockman at a warehouse for a charity organisation. \nThe other newly baptised at the service came from Albania, Peru, Italy and the United States. \nFrancis has made defence of migrants a key part of his papacy. \nOn Sunday, the pope ends Holy See services by celebrating an Easter Mass and then delivers his twice-yearly “Urbi et Orbi” (“to the city and the world”) blessing and message from the central balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica.
