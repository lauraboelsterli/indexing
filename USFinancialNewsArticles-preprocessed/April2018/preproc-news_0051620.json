For more information, visit www.zimmerbiomet.com or follow Zimmer Biomet on Twitter at www.twitter.com/zimmerbiomet .\nWebsite Information\nWe routinely post important information for investors on our website, www.zimmerbiomet.com , in the \"Investor Relations\" section. We use this website as a means of disclosing material, non-public information and for complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Accordingly, investors should monitor the Investor Relations section of our website, in addition to following our press releases, SEC filings, public conference calls, presentations and webcasts. The information contained on, or that may be accessed through, our website is not incorporated by reference into, and is not a part of, this document.\nNote on Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release includes non-GAAP financial measures that differ from financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nSales change information for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 is presented on a GAAP (reported) basis and on a constant currency basis. Constant currency percentage changes exclude the effects of foreign currency exchange rates. They are calculated by translating current and prior-period sales at the same predetermined exchange rate. The translated results are then used to determine year-over-year percentage increases or decreases.\nNet earnings and diluted earnings per share for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 are presented on a GAAP (reported) basis and on an adjusted basis. Adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude the effects of inventory step-up; certain inventory and manufacturing-related charges connected to discontinuing certain product lines, quality enhancement and remediation efforts; special items; intangible asset amortization; any related effects on our income tax provision associated with these items; the effect of U.S. tax reform; and other certain tax adjustments. Special items include expenses resulting directly from our business combinations and/or global restructuring, quality and operational excellence initiatives, including employee termination benefits, certain contract terminations, consulting and professional fees, dedicated project personnel, asset impairment or loss on disposal charges, certain litigation matters, costs of complying with our deferred prosecution agreement and other items. Other certain tax adjustments include internal restructuring transactions that lowered the tax rate on deferred tax liabilities recorded on intangible assets recognized in acquisition-related accounting.\nFree cash flow and projected free cash flow are additional non-GAAP measures that are presented in this press release. Free cash flow is computed by deducting additions to instruments and other property, plant and equipment from net cash provided by operating activities.\nReconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this press release. This press release also contains supplemental reconciliations of additional non-GAAP financial measures that the Company presents in other contexts. These additional non-GAAP financial measures are computed from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure as indicated in the applicable reconciliation.\nManagement uses non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business and believes they are useful measures that provide meaningful supplemental information to investors to consider when evaluating the performance of the Company. Management believes these measures offer the ability to make period-to-period comparisons that are not impacted by certain items that can cause dramatic changes in reported operating results, to perform trend analysis, to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items and to provide additional transparency of certain items. In addition, certain of these non-GAAP financial measures are used as performance metrics in the Company's incentive compensation programs.\nForward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release also includes certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures for the year ending December 31, 2018. We calculate forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures based on internal forecasts that omit certain amounts that would be included in GAAP financial measures. For instance, we exclude the impact of certain potential charges or gains connected to quality enhancement and remediation efforts and certain legal and tax matters. Other than projected free cash flow for the year ending December 31, 2018, for which a reconciliation is provided, we have not provided quantitative reconciliations of these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures because the excluded items are not available on a prospective basis without unreasonable efforts. It is probable that these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures may be materially different from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, among others, statements regarding sales and earnings guidance and any statements about our expectations, plans, strategies or prospects.
