    "text": "12 COMMENTS David Winters, a veteran value investor, has a provocative idea: Index funds aren’t the dirt-cheap choice we all believe them to be.\nThese autopilot portfolios that seek to match the market, not to beat it, have become the most popular investment vehicle in history. Tens of millions of investors hold roughly $4 trillion in U.S. stock index funds — which report annual ownership costs as low as 0.03%, or $3 on a $10,000 investment.\nThose expenses are drastically understated, says Mr. Winters, portfolio manager of Wintergreen Fund. In his latest letter to shareholders in the $303 million fund, Mr. Winters argues that the typical S&P 500 index fund incurred ownership costs exceeding 4.3%, or more than $430 per $10,000, in 2016.\nI think Mr. Winters is wrong, and it is worth noting that Wintergreen has underperformed 90% of similar funds over the past 10 years, according to Morningstar. Still, his argument is a reminder that costs can lurk unobserved and many fund managers shirk their duty.\nUnder Securities and Exchange Commission rules , companies must give shareholders the opportunity to express their approval or disapproval of management pay at least once every three years. Although companies can ignore them, those votes are a handy way to measure how often fund managers oppose executive-pay plans.\nWintergreen estimates that for the year ended June 30, 2016, leading S&P 500 index funds approved such proposals 97% of the time.\nAs a result, says Mr. Winters, companies can more easily get away with overpaying their bosses. In doing so, they issue new shares of stock, diluting the ownership interest of outside investors. Then, to counteract that, companies buy back shares at inflated prices.\n\nWintergreen estimates those combined costs at $908 billion for 2016, equivalent to an extra expense of 4.3%.\n“Because the index funds have become so dominant,” says Mr. Winters in an interview, “they have effectively created a hidden cost that affects the whole market.”\nHere’s why I think he is wrong.\nFar from every dollar that companies spend on paying their bosses is wasted, nor is every buyback misbegotten. Those expenditures can often add, rather than subtract, value. Mr. Winters says his firm’s calculations “aren’t meant to be a judgment” on every company’s practices.\nFurthermore, according to the Investment Company Institute, index mutual funds and exchange-traded funds hold 13% of the total market value of U.S. stocks. Actively managed funds run by stock pickers own 16%. Other types of investors hold the remaining 71%.\nThus, index funds own only a sliver more than an eighth of U.S. stocks. It seems silly to blame them exclusively.\nBut Mr. Winters is right about a broader point: Too many investors rubber-stamp rich executive pay for poor performance. It’s just that active funds are almost as guilty as their passive peers.\nMr. Winters concedes that his 4.3% cost estimate applies to anyone who owns the S&P 500, not just index-fund investors. “The active funds certainly have responsibility too,” he says.\nBecause index-fund managers seek only to track but not to beat the market, they derive no direct benefit from improving how a given company is run or how its managers are paid. Active managers trying to outperform can, in principle, do just that by shaking a company up or by turning its pay packages down.\nSo do they?\nMiriam Schwartz-Ziv, a finance professor at Michigan State University, has analyzed how funds cast votes on companies’ executive-compensation plans.\nIn data from 2011 through 2013 gathered for research with Russell Wermers at the University of Maryland, Prof. Schwartz-Ziv found that active funds were 19% more likely to vote against pay proposals than index funds are.\nMore In The Intelligent Investor Can Big Tech Stocks Grow Without Limits?
