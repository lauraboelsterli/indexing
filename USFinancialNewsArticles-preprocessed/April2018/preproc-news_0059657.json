    "text": "April 27, 2018 / 11:58 AM / Updated 3 minutes ago Cameco posts surprise profit on higher uranium prices Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Canada’s Cameco Corp ( CCO.TO ) ( CCJ.N ) reported a surprise profit for its first quarter on Friday, as the largest listed uranium producer benefited from higher prices and lower costs.\nThe Saskatchewan-based company said its average price for uranium rose about 25 percent to $42.92 per pound, while sales volumes rose nearly l6 percent to 6.6 million pounds.\nCameco in January suspended production from the McArthur River mine, the world’s biggest uranium mine, to cut costs and lower supply to an oversupplied uranium market. Its production fell to a third of what they were a year ago.\nOn an adjusted basis, the company earned 6 Canadian cents per share, while analysts had expected a loss of 1 Canadian cent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nNet earnings were C$55 million, or 14 Canadian cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, compared with a loss of C$18 million, or 5 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier.\nEarnings were helped by a C$49 million gain on the restructuring of its Inkai joint venture with Kazakhstan.\nRevenue rose to C$439 million from C$393 million.
