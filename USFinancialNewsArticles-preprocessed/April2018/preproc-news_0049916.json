Soccer Football - FA Cup Semi Final - Chelsea v Southampton - Wembley Stadium, London, Britain - April 22, 2018 Southampton manager Mark Hughes applauds fans after the match. REUTERS/Darren Staples/File Photo \nSouthampton have won just five of their 34 league games so far and are four points behind 17th-placed Swansea City with four matches left. \nA defeat by Bournemouth would extend Southampton’s winless run to nine league matches and leave the Saints on the brink of relegation. \n\"We need to go for it. It's going to be a huge game for everybody connected to the club, and everybody needs to pull together and get us over the line,\" Hughes told Southampton's website. southamptonfc.com \n“We’ll put a huge effort in. I’ve been pleased with the amount of effort they’ve put in, but we need winning situations and that’s what we’ll be looking for.” \nMidfielder Oriol Romeu said the home match against Bournemouth was the “most important” of the season for the club. \n“Every one of them is important for us to stay up. We want to give everything. We don’t want to look to the past and say we’ve left something in the dressing room,” Romeu added. \n“It’s important that we get that connection between us and the fans, so we can push onto together and get the points we need.” \nBournemouth are winless in their last four league matches and are 11th in the standings.
