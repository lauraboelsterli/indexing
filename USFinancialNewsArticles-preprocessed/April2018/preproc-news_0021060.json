(\"Hanwha Q CELLS\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: HQCL), a global leading photovoltaic manufacturer of high-performance, high-quality solar modules, today reported its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017. The Company will host a conference call to discuss the results at 8:00 am Eastern Time (9:00 pm Korea Standard Time) on April 11, 2018.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nNet revenues were $624.7 million, compared with $543.0 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $565.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross margin was 8.5%, compared with 11.6% in the third quarter of 2017 and 7.0% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating loss was $29.7 million, compared with operating income of $10.6 million in the third quarter of 2017 and operating loss of $21.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net loss attributable to Company's ordinary shareholders was $50.5 million, compared with net income of $5.0 million in the third quarter of 2017 and net loss of $18.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Loss per fully diluted American Depositary Share (\"ADS\" and each ADS represents 50 of the Company's ordinary shares) was $0.61, compared with earnings per fully diluted ADS of $0.06 in the third quarter of 2017 and loss per fully diluted ADS of $0.22 in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Highlights\nTotal revenue-recognized module shipments were 5,438MW for the full year 2017, an increase of 18.7% from 4,583MW for the full year 2016. Total net revenues were $2,177.4 million for the full year 2017, a decrease of 10.2% from $2,425.9 million for the full year 2016. Gross margin rate was 11.2% for the full year 2017, compared with 18.1% for the full year 2016. Operating income was $29.3 million in the full year 2017, compared with $192.1 million in the full year 2016. Net loss attributable to Company's ordinary shareholders was $9.2 million for the full year 2017, compared with net income of $127.5 million for the full year 2016. Loss per fully diluted ADS was $0.11 for the full year 2017, compared with earnings per fully diluted ADS of $1.75 for the full year 2016.\nMr. Seong Woo Nam, CEO of Hanwha Q CELLS, explained that in 2017, the Company was able to re-establish the course of its strategic direction, focusing more on solidifying its leadership in new markets. He noted that the modules manufactured in the Company's Turkish fab under the JV will be supplied to the Company's 1.3 GW DC solar power plant with a target commercial operation date of 2021 and expressed confidence in the Turkish project's potential to enable the Company to \"establish a commanding leadership in the Middle Eastern market through increased brand awareness, proven track record, and locally manufactured products shielded from potential trade disputes.\"\nMr. Moon Seong Choi, Senior Vice President of Corporate Planning, noted that the Company's \"fourth quarter and full year results were in-line with the Company's guidance set forth in Q3 and last year, respectively.\" Mr. Choi noted that despite the negative impact of Section 201 tariffs in the U.S. solar market, the Company \"will continually look for ways to provide high quality solar modules to its customers in the U.S.\" He added that the Company will focus on expanding its footprint in the U.S. residential segment with its mono-PERC half-cell products as the Section 201 tariffs are expected to have a lesser impact on residential demand.\nMr. Jay Seo, the Company's CFO, noted that the Company's bottom line was negatively affected by the recognition of a one-time loss associated with the discontinuation of its wafer manufacturing operations and bad debt expenses, without which the Company would have seen an improvement in its profitability due to elimination of losses resulting from unprofitable operations as well as a downward trend in wafer prices. Mr. Seo noted that the Company observed a steady downward trend in wafer prices, due to \"reduced demand for mono-crystalline wafers after the deadline for Top Runner projects in China, combined with additional mono wafer capacities coming on-line in China.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results of Operations\nNet Revenues\nTotal net revenues were $624.7 million, up 15.0% from $543.0 million in the third quarter of 2017 and up 10.5% from $565.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nGross Profit and Margin\nGross profit in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $53.4 million, down 15.5% from $63.2 million in the third quarter of 2017 and up 34.8% from $39.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 8.5%, compared with 11.6% in the third quarter of 2017 and 7.0% in the fourth quarter of 2016.
