    "text": "April 18, 2018 / 6:23 AM / Updated 4 hours ago De La Rue profit hit as drops blue British passport bid Paul Sandle 3 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - De La Rue ( DLAR.L ) abandoned its challenge to Britain’s decision to award the contract for new blue post-Brexit passports to a foreign firm and issued a profit warning on Wednesday. A handout photograph shows the original 'blue' British passport, which was subsequently replaced by the burgundy EU British passport, supplied by the UK government in London, Britain, March 22, 2018. UK Government/Handout via Reuters \nIts shares fell 9 percent to a year low of 446 pence in early trading and were down 4 percent at 0851 GMT after De La Rue said it would write-off about 4 million pounds of costs associated with the failed bid. \nTogether with delays in some contracts in the last week of its financial year, this would result in it missing profit expectations, De La Rue said in a statement. \nPrime Minister Theresa May said the decision to change British passports from the burgundy shade used by most European Union countries to the traditional dark blue was an expression of British independence and sovereignty. \nBut reports that Franco-Dutch firm Gemalto ( GTO.AS ) had won the tender to produce the new passport was criticised by some politicians and newspapers as unpatriotic, and De La Rue had said it would challenge the decision. Slideshow (2 Images) \nDe La Rue, which prints 7 billion banknotes and 15 million passports a year, said that having considered all options it would not appeal the decision, which the British government said followed a “rigorous, fair and open competition”. SURPRISED AND DISAPPOINTED \nThe existing contract to make British passports is worth 400 million pounds and the new contract starts in October 2019, after Britain leaves the EU in March that year. \nDe La Rue’s Chief Executive Martin Sutherland told BBC radio that he remained “surprised and disappointed”, but he had taken a pragmatic business decision not to appeal. \nUnderlying operating profit for the year to end-March would be in the low to mid 60s million pound range, it said. \nAnalysts at Investec, who were predicting 71 million pounds, said it was a “disappointing outcome”. \nRevenue for the year had increased by about 6 percent, with growth across all product lines, it said, although it added that it was “cautious” about its current financial year. \nIt said it would assist with the transition to the new supplier, and was expecting no impact on its performance in the next 18 months. \nTrade union Unite said news that De La Rue was abandoning its appeal would come as a bitter blow to workers in Gateshead, north east England, who now faced an uncertain future. \n“Workers will feel let down that the company is not prepared to fight the government’s decision to ship the production of the new blue passport overseas,” Unite national officer Louisa Bull said.
