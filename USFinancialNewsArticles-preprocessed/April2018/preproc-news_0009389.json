    "text": "Todd Frazier and Travis d’Arnaud each had run-scoring hits in the sixth inning Tuesday night, and five New York Mets pitchers combined to three-hit the Philadelphia Phillies in a 2-0 win at Citi Field.\nNew York starter Matt Harvey (1-0) allowed just one hit — a leadoff single in the second by Rhys Hopkins — and one walk while striking out five over five innings. Harvey ended last season by recording an 11.28 ERA in six September appearances (five starts) following his return from a stress injury in his shoulder.\nThe Mets have won three of their first four games while the Phillies have dropped three of their first four.\nThe teams combined to put just three runners in scoring position in the first five scoreless innings before the bottom of the sixth, which began with Phillies starter Ben Lively (0-1) plunking Yoenis Cespedes. Jay Bruce’s groundout moved Cespedes to second before Cespedes cruised home on Frazier’s double to left.\nFrazier advanced to third on a groundout by Adrian Gonzalez and scored on d’Arnaud’s single. Frazier was the only player on either team to record two hits.\nThe tie-breaking rally made a winner out of left-hander Jerry Blevins (1-0), who retired the only batter he faced, Odubel Herrera, to strand a pair of runners in the top of the inning.\nSeth Lugo, making his season debut, struck out four in two perfect innings and threw 19 of his 22 pitches for strikes. Jeurys Familia earned his second save by wriggling out of trouble in the ninth, when he issued a leadoff walk to Aaron Altherr and allowed a one-out single to Herrera before retiring the final two batters to leave the runners at the corners.\nLively allowed both runs on eight hits and one walk while striking out five over 5 2/3 innings — the longest start this season by a Phillies pitcher.\nCesar Hernandez had the Phillies’ other hit, a leadoff bunt single in the sixth against AJ Ramos.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
