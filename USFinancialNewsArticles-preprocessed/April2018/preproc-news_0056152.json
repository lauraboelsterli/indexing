The fundamentals of our core FPGA business remain positive as we ramp many of our new design wins into production. This includes our control and connect applications in data center servers, smart speaker products, video displays, and broad market industrial applications. Looking forward, we are encouraged by the promising early adopter successes of our edge computing applications and the launch of our comprehensive artificial intelligence tools in Q2.\"\nMax Downing, Chief Financial Officer, added, \"The year is off to a good start as our Q1 revenue and gross margin were in line with our expectations. Our non-GAAP operating expenses came in above our expectations due to approximately $2.4 million in non-recurring expenses. We remain committed to realizing our long-term cost structure targets and continue to pursue the improvements we have previously outlined, as well as other operational efficiencies we have identified. Our first quarter revenue benefited from a higher level of channel partner inventory to meet increased demand in our computing, consumer, and industrial markets. We ended the first quarter with a healthy $111.5 million in cash and short-term investments, and continue to prioritize increasing free cash flow and paying down corporate debt.\"\nBusiness Outlook - Second Quarter of 2018:\nRevenue for the second quarter of 2018 is expected to be between approximately $98 million and $102 million. Gross margin percentage for the second quarter of 2018 is expected to be approximately 56% plus or minus 2% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Total operating expenses for the second quarter of 2018 are expected to be between approximately $50.5 million and $52.5 million on a GAAP basis and between approximately $43 million and $45 million on a non-GAAP basis.\n* For a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP business outlook, see accompanying tables \"Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nInvestor Conference Call / Webcast Details:\nLattice Semiconductor will review the Company's financial results for the fiscal first quarter of 2018 and business outlook for the second quarter and full year 2018 on Thursday, April 26 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The conference call-in number is 1-888-684-5603 or 1-918-398-4852 with conference identification number 6887938. An accompanying presentation and live webcast of the conference call will also be available on Lattice's website at www.latticesemi.com . The Company's financial guidance will be limited to the comments on its public quarterly earnings call and the public business outlook statements contained in this press release.\nA replay of the call will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of the live call through 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on May 3, 2018, by telephone at 1-404-537-3406. To access the replay, use conference identification number 6887938. A webcast replay will also be available on the investor relations section of www.latticesemi.com .\nForward-Looking Statements Notice:\nThe foregoing paragraphs contain that involve estimates, assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Any statements about our expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance are not historical facts and may be forward-looking. Such include statements relating to: our expectation that we will continue to realize our long-term cost structure targets and continue to pursue the improvements we have previously outlined, as well as other operational efficiencies we have identified; and the statements under the heading “Business Outlook - Second Quarter of 2018.” Other may be indicated by words such as “will,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “may,” “expect,” “plan,” “project,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “forecast,” “future,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “propose,” “potential,” “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology; and our expectation that we will remain focused on maximizing the leverage of our operating model and reduce our outstanding debt balance. Lattice believes the factors identified below could cause actual results to differ materially from the .\nEstimates of future revenue are inherently uncertain due to such factors as global economic conditions, which may affect customer demand, pricing pressures, competitive actions, the demand for our Mature, Mainstream and New products, and in particular our iCE40™ and MachXO3L™ devices, the ability to supply products to customers in a timely manner, changes in our distribution relationships, or the volatility of our consumer business. Actual gross margin percentage and operating expenses could vary from the estimates on the basis of, among other things, changes in revenue levels, changes in product pricing and mix, changes in wafer, assembly, test and other costs, including commodity costs, variations in manufacturing yields, the failure to sustain operational improvements, the actual amount of compensation charges due to stock price changes. Any unanticipated declines in revenue or gross margin, any unanticipated increases in our operating expenses or unanticipated charges could adversely affect our profitability.\nIn addition to the foregoing, other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the in this press release include global economic uncertainty, overall semiconductor market conditions, market acceptance and demand for our new products, the Company's dependencies on its silicon wafer suppliers, the impact of competitive products and pricing, technological and product development risks. In addition, actual results are subject to other risks and uncertainties that relate more broadly to our overall business, including those risks more fully described in Lattice’s filings with the SEC including its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017, and Lattice’s quarterly reports filed on Form 10-Q.\nYou should not unduly rely on because actual results could differ materially from those expressed in any . In addition, any forward-looking statement applies only as of the date on which it is made. The Company does not intend to update or revise any , whether as a result of events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures:\nIncluded within this press release and the accompanying tables and notes are non-GAAP financial measures that supplement the Company's consolidated financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP measures presented exclude charges and adjustments primarily related to stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, acquisition-related charges, amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment of intangible assets, and the estimated tax effect of these items. These charges and adjustments may be nonrecurring in nature but are a result of periodic or non-core operating activities of the Company. The Company describes these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciles them to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables and notes attached to this press release.\nThe Company's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional and useful way of viewing aspects of our performance that, when viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results, provide a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors and trends affecting our ongoing financial performance and operating results than GAAP measures alone. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures for strategic and business decision-making, internal budgeting, forecasting, and resource allocation processes and believes that investors should have access to similar data when making their investment decisions.\nIn addition, the Company uses Adjusted EBITDA in calculating the annual excess cash flow debt payment. These non-GAAP measures are included solely for informational and comparative purposes and are not meant as a substitute for GAAP and should be considered together with the consolidated financial information located in the tables attached to this press release.\nAbout Lattice Semiconductor Corporation:\nLattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC) is a leader in smart connectivity solutions at the network edge, where the “things” of IoT live. Our low power FPGA, 60 GHz millimeter wave, video ASSP and IP products deliver edge intelligence, edge connectivity, and control solutions to the consumer, communications, industrial, compute, and automotive markets.
