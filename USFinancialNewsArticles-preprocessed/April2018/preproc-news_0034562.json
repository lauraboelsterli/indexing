    "text": "GENEVA, April 16 (Reuters) - The European Union is seeking compensation from the United States for U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium, despite Washington’s claim that they are not subject to World Trade Organization rules, a WTO filing showed on Monday.\nIn a step already taken by China, the EU said it did not accept the U.S. claim that the tariffs were based on national security, and it regarded them as “safeguard tariffs” under the WTO rules.
