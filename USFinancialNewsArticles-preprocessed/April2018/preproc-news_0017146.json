FILE PHOTO: John Watson, Chevron's chairman and CEO, speaks during an interview on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 8, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo \nThe San Ramon, California-based company awarded Watson $24.8 million in compensation for 2017, when the company swung to an annual profit of $9.2 billion. The compensation includes a base salary as well as stock awards and other items, including use of the corporate jet. \nWatson retired in February 2018. His pay was 180 times larger than the median compensation of $137,849 for Chevronâ€™s 52,953 employees. Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by Richard Chang",
