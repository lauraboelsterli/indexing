    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he thought he could have a very good relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but that it was not a sure bet.\n“I think I could have a very good relationship with Russia and with President Putin, and if I did, that would be a great thing. And there’s also a great possibility that that won’t happen. Who knows?,” Trump said at a White House news conference with leaders from Baltic nations.\nReporting by Steve Holland; Writing by Tim Ahmann; editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ",
