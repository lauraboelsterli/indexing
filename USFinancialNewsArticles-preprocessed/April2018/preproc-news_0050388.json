Please refresh the page if you do not see a player above at that time.]\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders is slated to brief reporters Monday.\nIt's the first such briefing since the Democratic National Committee announced a far-reaching lawsuit against the Trump campaign, Russia and Wikileaks on Friday , alleging a conspiracy to hurt Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton 's chances during the 2016 presidential election.\nPresident Donald Trump responded to the lawsuit in a pair of tweets, calling the action \"good news\" for his Republicans insofar as it provides an opening to counter-sue for more information about the opposing party. \nTrump tweet 1 \nTrump tweet 2 \nThe new lawsuit sits atop a heap of other legal actions trailing Trump and the handful of investigations into both his campaign and his associates . \nTrump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, attended a hearing on April 9 regarding the slew of materials seized by federal agents in raids on his properties from the week before . Lawyers for both Cohen and Trump initially argued that they, not the prosecuting attorneys or a separate group of federal lawyers, should be the first to review which of the seized materials are protected by attorney-client privilege.\nIn the wake of the hearings, numerous allies of Trump reacted to Cohen's situation by speculating on whether Cohen would flip in the case and become a cooperating witness .\nTrump himself weighed in on Cohen's resilience, saying in a series of tweets that he doesn't see Cohen \"doing that.\"\nTrump tweet 3 \nTrump tweet 4 \nMeanwhile, CIA Director Mike Pompeo is facing significant opposition from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , which will vote today on whether to recommend him to become Trump's secretary of state.",
