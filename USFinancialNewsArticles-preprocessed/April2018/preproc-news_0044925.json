    "text": "LONDON, April 19 (Reuters) - Unilever , the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant, reported first-quarter sales that met expectations, helped by volume gains, and maintained its full-year outlook.\nThe maker of Dove soap and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, which is in the process of overhauling its corporate structure, said on Thursday that underlying sales rose 3.4 percent, meeting an analysts’ consensus supplied by the company.\nReported turnover fell 5.2 percent to 12.6 billion euros, hurt by currency exchange rates. Analysts were expecting 12.84 billion euros.\nThe company, which recently decided to collapse its dual-headed structure and picked Rotterdam as its main home base, stood by its forecast for 2018 sales growth of 3 to 5 percent.
