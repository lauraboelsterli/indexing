    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Silverpeak, a New York based investment management firm, today announced the acquisition of certain assets in the Uinta Basin from LINN Energy, Inc. for an acquisition price of $132 million. The assets will be managed by Altamont Energy, a recently formed affiliate of Silverpeak.\nLocated in Utah’s oil-rich Altamont Bluebell field, the assets are comprised of approximately 36,000 net acres, including 27,000 undeveloped acres. The acreage includes 116 PDP wells, with significant reserves, work-over and development opportunities.\n“We are excited about the opportunity to acquire and further develop these well-located assets,” said Harsh Rameshwar, a partner in Silverpeak’s energy business. “We see significant growth through operational and well maintenance improvements and an active development program using proven production technologies and methodical subsurface engineering.”\nDr. Jorge Manrique will lead Altamont Energy’s management team. Members of the team have significant experience developing and operating upstream assets and previously participated in the development of the Uinta Basin. “The Uinta Basin is one of the largest hydrocarbon producing areas with OOIP comparable to the Eagle Ford and Bakken,” said Dr. Manrique. “We believe Altamont is well-positioned to capitalize on the potential of the assets through a robust development program which will be further supported by our expertise within the basin.”\nAbout Silverpeak\nSilverpeak is a multi-strategy investment platform with expertise in the real estate, energy and credit sectors.
