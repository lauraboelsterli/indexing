    "text": "AUBURN HILLS, Mich., April 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- BorgWarner Inc. (NYSE: BWA) today reported first quarter results.\nFirst Quarter Highlights:\nU.S. GAAP net sales of $2,784 million, up 15.7% compared with first quarter 2017. On a comparable basis, excluding the impact of foreign currencies and the acquisition of Sevcon, net sales were up 6.6% compared with first quarter 2017. U.S. GAAP net earnings of $1.07 per diluted share. Excluding the non-comparable item (detailed in the table below), net earnings were $1.10 per diluted share. U.S. GAAP operating income of $334 million. Adjusted operating income was 12.2% of net sales.\nFull Year 2018 Guidance: The company has reaffirmed its 2018 full year organic growth guidance. Full year net sales are expected to be $10.77 billion - $10.94 billion, implying organic sales growth of 5.0% to 7.0%. Foreign currencies are expected to increase sales by $405 million, due to the appreciation of the Euro and Chinese Yuan. The acquisition of Sevcon will increase sales by approximately $50 million. Excluding the impact of noncomparable items, operating margin is expected to be in the range of 12.5%-12.6%. This guidance includes a negative margin impact of 10bps as a result of other postretirement income reclassification in accordance with FASB ASU No. 2017-07, \"Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.\" This is expected to have no net earnings impact compared to prior guidance. Net earnings are now expected to be within a range of $4.30 to $4.40, with the increase in guidance primarily due to a larger benefit from foreign exchange rates. This guidance includes a year over year negative impact of $0.06 per diluted share due to higher minority interest and lower equity income.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Guidance: The company expects second quarter 2018 organic net sales growth of 7.0% to 9.0%, compared with second quarter 2017 net sales of $2.39 billion. Foreign currencies are expected to increase sales by $125 million. The acquisition of Sevcon will increase sales by approximately $15 million. Net earnings are expected to be within a range of $1.09 to $1.11 per diluted share, including a negative year over year impact of $0.02 per diluted share due to higher minority interest and lower equity income.\nFinancial Results: Net sales were $2,784 million in first quarter 2018, up 15.7% from $2,407 million in first quarter 2017. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies and the acquisition of Sevcon, net sales were up 6.6% compared with first quarter 2017. Net earnings in first quarter 2018 were $225 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, compared with $189 million, or $0.89 per diluted share in first quarter 2017. Net earnings in first quarter 2018 included non-comparable items of ($0.03) per diluted share. Net earnings in the first quarter 2017 included net non-comparable items of $(0.02) per diluted share. These items are listed in a table below, which is provided by the company for comparison with other results and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. The impact of foreign currencies increased net sales by approximately $200 million and increased net earnings by approximately $0.08 per diluted share in first quarter 2018 compared with first quarter 2017. The impact of the acquisition of Sevcon increased net sales by $20 million in the first quarter 2018 compared with first quarter 2017.\nThe company believes the following table is useful in highlighting non-comparable items that impacted its U.S. GAAP net earnings per diluted share:\nNet earnings per diluted share\nFirst Three Months\n2018\n2017\nU.S. GAAP\n$\n1.07\n$\n0.89\nNon-comparable items:\nRestructuring expense\n0.03\n—\nMerger and acquisition expense\n0.01\n—\nGain on commercial settlement\n(0.01)\n—\nTax adjustments\n—\n0.02\nNon – U.S. GAAP\n$\n1.10\n$\n0.91\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $35 million in first quarter 2018 compared with $60 million in first quarter 2017.
