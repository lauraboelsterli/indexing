Consolidated operating margin declined 490 basis points to 12.8%, primarily due to restructuring and impairments, food-related mix shift primarily in the Americas segment, higher investments in our store partners (employees), and the impact of our ownership change in East China.\nQ2 Americas Segment Results\nQuarter Ended Change ($ in millions) Apr 1, 2018 Apr 2, 2017 Net New Stores 187 200 (13) Revenues $4,003.5 $3,720.4 8% Operating Income $801.3 $826.1 (3)% Operating Margin 20.0% 22.2% (220) bps Net revenues for the Americas segment grew 8% over Q2 FY17 to $4.0 billion in Q2 FY18, primarily driven by incremental revenues from 966 net new store openings over the past 12 months and a 2% growth in comparable store sales.\nOperating income declined 3% to $801.3 million in Q2 FY18, down from $826.1 million in Q2 FY17.

The increase was partially offset by the absence of company-operated store revenue related to the sale of our Singapore retail operations to a licensed partner in Q4 FY17.\nQ2 FY18 operating income of $204.6 million grew 16% over Q2 FY17 operating income of $175.9 million. Operating margin declined 570 basis points to 17.2%, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in East China.\nQ2 EMEA Segment Results\nQuarter Ended Change ($ in millions) Apr 1, 2018 Apr 2, 2017 Net New Stores 64 46 18 Revenues $266.1 $231.7 15% Operating Income/(Loss) ($4.3) $27.7 (116)% Operating Margin (1.6)% 12.0% (1,360) bps Net revenues for the EMEA segment grew 15% over Q2 FY17 to $266.1 million in Q2 FY18, primarily driven by favorable foreign currency translation and incremental revenues from the opening of 385 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months. Partially offsetting the increase was a decrease in comparable store sales.\nOperating loss of $4.3 million in Q2 FY18 declined 116% versus operating income of $27.7 million in Q2 FY17. Operating margin declined 1,360 basis points to (1.6)%, primarily driven by a partial impairment of goodwill related to our Switzerland retail business and sales deleverage on company-operated stores.\nQ2 Channel Development Segment Results\nQuarter Ended Change ($ in millions) Apr 1, 2018 Apr 2, 2017 Revenues $500.2 $461.3 8% Operating Income $215.3 $193.6 11% Operating Margin 43.0% 42.0% 100 bps Net revenues for the Channel Development segment of $500.2 million in Q2 FY18 increased 8% versus the prior year quarter primarily driven by higher sales of premium single-serve products and lapping a prior year revenue deduction adjustment, partially offset by the absence of revenue from the sale of our Tazo brand in fiscal 2018.\nOperating income of $215.3 million in Q2 FY18 grew 11% compared to Q2 FY17. Operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 43.0%, primarily driven by lapping a revenue deduction adjustment, partially offset by lower income from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture.\nQ2 All Other Segments Results\nQuarter Ended Change ($ in millions) Apr 1, 2018 Apr 2, 2017 Net New Stores (297) (6) (291) Revenues $75.6 $111.7 (32)% Operating Loss $(114.8) $(25.5) 350% All Other Segments primarily includes Seattle’s Best Coffee®, Starbucks Reserve TM Coffee and Roastery businesses, and Teavana-branded stores.

The company announced that Starbucks had reached 100 percent pay equity for partners of all genders and races performing similar work across the U.S. In partnership with Closed Loop Partners and its Center for the Circular Economy, Starbucks committed $10 million in March to establish a groundbreaking consortium launching the NextGen Cup Challenge. Through the NextGen Cup Challenge, the consortium will award accelerator grants to promote the development of more sustainable cup solutions and invite industry participation and partnership on the way to identifying a global solution. The company announced that it had entered into an agreement with SouthRock Capital Ltda – a leading multi-brand restaurant operator in Brazil – to fully license Starbucks retail operations in Brazil. The agreement provides SouthRock the rights to develop and operate Starbucks stores across the country. With the transition of ownership in Brazil, Starbucks retail operations across all markets in Latin America and the Caribbean became wholly licensed. In March Starbucks opened the doors to its 46,000-square foot Hacienda Alsacia Visitor Center, located on the grounds of its Costa Rican coffee farm. The company opened its Starbucks Reserve TM Coffee SODO store in Seattle on February 27, inviting visitors to take a journey of discovery with small-lot Starbucks Reserve TM coffees and Princi TM food. This location is the first of the company’s new Starbucks Reserve store concept, introducing a marketplace-style environment to showcase its premium Starbucks Reserve brand. In February, Starbucks and Chase announced the availability of the Starbucks Rewards TM Visa® Card, a co-brand credit card integrated directly into the Starbucks Rewards TM loyalty program. The new credit card is an expansion of the ongoing relationship between the two companies. Chase Merchant Services is the payment processing partner for Starbucks stores in the U.S. and Canada, and Chase Pay is accepted at participating Starbucks stores in the U.S., as well as through the Starbucks mobile app. For the 12th consecutive year, Starbucks was named one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies by the Ethisphere Institute in February. Separately, Starbucks was named the fifth most admired company in the world by Fortune magazine in January. This is the 16th year in a row that Starbucks has appeared on Fortune’s global list. The company closed an underwritten public offering of $1 billion of 3.100% senior notes due 2023 and $600 million of 3.500% senior notes due 2028. The company plans to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of Starbucks common stock under the company’s ongoing share repurchase program, business expansion, payment of cash dividends on Starbucks common stock, or the financing of possible acquisitions. The company repurchased 27.4 million shares of common stock in Q2 FY18; the company's Board of Directors has authorized an additional 100 million shares for repurchase under its ongoing share repurchase program.

Non-GAAP Disclosure\nIn addition to the GAAP results provided in this release, the company provides certain non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, or alternatives for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP EPS exclude the below listed items, as they do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company's future operating performance or comparisons to the company's past operating performance. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP EPS are operating income, operating margin and diluted net earnings per share, respectively.\nNon-GAAP Exclusion Rationale East China acquisition-related gain Management excludes the gain on the purchase of our East China joint venture as this incremental gain is specific to the purchase activity and for reasons discussed above. Sale of Taiwan joint venture operations Management excludes the gain related to the sale of our Taiwan joint venture operations as this incremental gain is specific to the sale activity and for reasons discussed above. Sale of Tazo brand Management excludes the net gain on the sale of our assets associated with our Tazo brand and associated transaction costs as these items do not reflect future gains, losses, costs or tax benefits and for reasons discussed above. Sale of Brazil retail operations Management excludes the net loss related to the sale of our Brazil retail operations and associated transaction costs as these items do not reflect future losses, expenses or tax impacts for reasons discussed above. Restructuring, impairment and optimization costs Management excludes restructuring charges and business process optimization costs related to strategic shifts in its Teavana, e-commerce and other business units. Additionally, management excludes expenses related to divesting certain lower margin businesses and assets, such as closure of certain company-operated stores and Switzerland goodwill impairment. Management excludes these items for reasons discussed above. These expenses are anticipated to be completed within a finite period of time. CAP transaction and integration-related costs Management excludes transaction and integration costs and amortization of the acquired intangible assets for reasons discussed above. Additionally, the majority of these costs will be recognized over a finite period of time. Sale of Singapore retail operations Management excludes the net gain related to the sale of our Singapore retail operations as these items do not reflect future gains, losses or tax impacts and for reasons discussed above. Sale of Germany retail operations Management excludes the net gain, associated costs and changes in estimated indemnifications related to the sale of our Germany retail operations as these items do not reflect future gains, losses or tax impacts and for reasons discussed above. The Starbucks Foundation donation Management excludes the company's largest donation to a non-profit organization for reasons discussed above. 2018 U.S. stock award Management excludes the announced incremental 2018 stock-based compensation award for reasons discussed above. Other tax matters On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into U.S. law. Management excludes the estimated transition tax on undistributed foreign earnings and the re–measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate for reasons discussed above. Non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP EPS may have limitations as analytical tools. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company's results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than the company does, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\nSTARBUCKS CORPORATION RECONCILIATION OF SELECTED GAAP MEASURES TO NON-GAAP MEASURES (unaudited)\n($ in millions) Quarter Ended Consolidated\nApr 1,\n2018 Apr 2,\n2017 Change Operating income, as reported (GAAP) $ 772.5 $ 935.4 (17.4)% Restructuring, impairment and optimization costs (1) 135.2 — CAP transaction and integration-related items (2) 66.9 13.8 Sale of Brazil retail operations transaction costs 1.6 — Sale of Tazo brand transaction costs 0.9 — Non-GAAP operating income $ 977.1 $ 949.2 2.9% Operating margin, as reported (GAAP) 12.8 % 17.7 % (490) bps Restructuring, impairment and optimization costs (1) 2.2 — CAP transaction and integration-related items (2) 1.1 0.3 Sale of Brazil retail operations transaction costs\n—\n—\nSale of Tazo brand — — Non-GAAP operating margin 16.2 % 17.9 % (170) bps Diluted net earnings per share, as reported (GAAP) $ 0.47 $ 0.45 4.4% East China acquisition gain (0.03 ) — Sale of Taiwan joint venture operations — — Sale of Tazo brand, net of transaction costs — — Restructuring, impairment and optimization costs (1) 0.10 — CAP transaction and integration-related items (2) 0.05 0.01 Sale of Germany retail operations (3) — (0.01 ) Loss on sale of Brazil retail operations, net of transaction costs — — Other tax matters (4) 0.02 — Income tax effect on Non-GAAP adjustments (5) (0.08 ) — Non-GAAP net earnings per share $ 0.53 $ 0.45 17.8% (1) Represents $106.2 million associated with our restructuring efforts, primarily lease termination costs, $28.5 million of Switzerland goodwill impairment and $2.8 million of business process optimization costs, primarily consulting fees.
