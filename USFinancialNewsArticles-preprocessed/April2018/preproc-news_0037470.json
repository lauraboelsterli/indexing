(Nasdaq/NGS: PNFP) reported net income per diluted common share of $1.08 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to net income per diluted common share of $0.82 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, an increase of 31.7 percent.\nExcluding pre-tax merger related charges of $5.4 million, net income per diluted common share was $1.13 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to net income per diluted common share of $0.83 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, excluding pre-tax merger-related charges of $672,000, an increase of 36.1 percent.\n\"I am very pleased that we are reporting year over year quarterly earnings growth of greater than 30 percent which is consistent with expectations for this year,\" said M. Terry Turner, Pinnacle's president and chief executive officer. \"Our first quarter 2018 loan growth was exceptional even by our historical standards. Over time, our principal tactic for rapid balance sheet growth has been our ability to attract the best bankers in our markets. During the first quarter of 2018, we experienced significant hiring success throughout the franchise including in the Carolina and Virginia markets. Specifically, during the first quarter of 2018, we hired a total of 21 revenue producers across our markets, a strong predictor of our future growth.\n\"In addition to sound growth, we remain committed to advancing our already high profitability metrics,\" said Turner. \"At the beginning of 2012, we anticipated that our return on average assets (ROAA) should operate within a targeted range of 1.10 percent to 1.30 percent. Since that time, due to the efforts of our associates, we were able to increase the targeted ROAA range at least twice such that our published ROAA target range has most recently been 1.30 percent to 1.50 percent. At this time, we are again increasing our targeted range to 1.50 percent to 1.70 percent. The changes in tax laws have obviously contributed to our decision to increase our targeted range, but that said, given the absolute level of our new targeted range, we believe the ultimate winners will be our shareholders.\"\nGROWING THE CORE EARNINGS CAPACITY OF THE FIRM:\nLoans at March 31, 2018 were a record $16.33 billion, an increase of $692.9 million from Dec. 31, 2017 and $7.68 billion from March 31, 2017, reflecting year-over-year growth of 88.9 percent. Annualized organic loan growth during the first quarter of 2018 was 18.0 percent. Average loans were $15.96 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2018, up $437 million from the $15.52 billion for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2017. Deposits at March 31, 2018 were a record $16.50 billion, an increase of $51.2 million from Dec. 31, 2017 and $7.22 billion from March 31, 2017, reflecting year-over-year growth of 77.8 percent. Average deposits were $16.28 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2018, up $189 million from the $16.10 billion for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2017. Revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $218.7 million, an increase of $7.4 million, or 3.5 percent, from the $211.2 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $99.5 million, or 83.5 percent, from the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Revenue per fully-diluted share was $2.83 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $2.73 for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $2.46 for the first quarter of 2017. Excluding investment securities gains and losses, revenue per fully-diluted share was $2.83 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2017.\n\"We are reporting almost $700 million in organic loan growth during the first quarter of 2018, or an 18.0 percent annualized rate of growth,\" Turner said. \"Importantly, we are pleased that approximately 50 percent of this growth was in the commercial and industrial segment. That said, we will continue to focus on C&I and owner-occupied CRE as our two primary loan growth segments going forward.\"\nFOCUSING ON PROFITABILITY:\nReturn on average assets was 1.53 percent for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 0.48 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 1.41 percent for the first quarter last year. First quarter 2018 return on average tangible assets amounted to 1.67 percent, compared to 0.53 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 1.47 percent for the first quarter last year. In addition to merger-related charges and investment securities losses, fourth quarter 2017 results included a $31.5 million charge related to the revaluation of the firm’s deferred tax assets pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act). Excluding the aforementioned merger-related charges, investment securities gains and losses and, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the revaluation of deferred tax assets, return on average assets was 1.60 percent for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 1.36 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 1.42 percent for the first quarter of 2017; likewise, excluding these same items the firm’s return on average tangible assets was 1.74 percent for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 1.48 percent for both the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2017. Return on average equity for the first quarter of 2018 amounted to 9.07 percent, compared to 2.87 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 9.70 percent for the same quarter last year. First quarter 2018 return on average tangible equity amounted to 18.12 percent, compared to 5.76 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 14.74 percent for the same quarter last year. Excluding the aforementioned merger-related charges, investment securities gains and losses and in the fourth quarter of 2017, the impact of the revaluation of deferred tax assets, return on average tangible equity amounted to 18.98 percent for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 16.11 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 14.89 percent for the first quarter of 2017.\n\"We are pleased with our returns for the first quarter of 2018 and are excited that we can increase our targeted operating range for ROAA at this time,\" said Harold R. Carpenter, Pinnacle's chief financial officer. \"All of this points to the confidence we have in our associates and their ongoing ability to generate solid returns for our shareholders. Our focus remains on maintaining a work environment second to none which is critical to attracting the best bankers in our markets. In the end, we anticipate our associates will continue to gather great clients and our shareholders will continue to reap the rewards.\"\nOTHER HIGHLIGHTS:\nRevenues Net interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $174.5 million, compared to $174.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $88.8 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net interest margin was 3.77 percent for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 3.76 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 3.60 for the first quarter of 2017. Excluding the accretion from the application of fair value accounting for acquired loans and deposits, the net interest margin expanded to approximately 3.42 percent for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 3.33 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 3.39 percent for the first quarter of 2017. Noninterest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $44.2 million, compared to $36.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $30.4 million for the first quarter of 2017. Excluding investment securities gains and losses in each period, noninterest income for the three months ended March 31, 2018, amounted to $44.2 million compared to $44.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Wealth management revenues, which include investment, trust and insurance services, were $11.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $9.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $6.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, wealth management revenues increased 77.6 percent over the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Net gains from the sale of residential mortgage loans were $3.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $3.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $4.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, net gains on the sale of residential mortgage loans decreased 9.9 percent over the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Income from the firm's investment in Bankers Healthcare Group, Inc. (BHG) was $9.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $12.4 million for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2017 and $7.8 million for the first quarter last year. Income from the firm's investment in BHG grew 19.6 percent for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\n\"The first quarter of any year is usually our most difficult revenue quarter given the fewer number of days impacting both net interest income and fees,\" Carpenter said. \"Additionally, during the first quarter of 2018, impacting net interest income was reduced accretion from fair value adjustments, which totaled approximately $15.4 million, down from $19.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $20.5 million during the third quarter of 2017. As a result, to overcome these factors and maintain net interest income essentially flat for the first quarter is a great accomplishment and, along with our growth in earning assets, points toward a great start for the remainder of 2018. At March 31, 2018, approximately $148.9 million of discount from loans from past acquisitions remains on our balance sheet.\n\"Fees were down slightly on a linked-quarter basis which is not unusual for the first quarter for our franchise. When comparing fee categories to the prior year comparable period, most fees show consistent growth even after excluding the impact of the BNC Bancorp merger. That said, wealth management’s growth over last year was exceptional reflecting several key hires that were made in 2017. Additionally, BHG delivered a strong first quarter with 20 percent growth over the same quarter last year.\n\"We fully expect the biggest driver of incremental revenue growth in 2018 to be the balance sheet growth associated with our hiring success. Our focus will remain on growing share in the commercial and industrial segment. Our C&I loans are up approximately 34 percent linked quarter annualized. We fully expect that growth in C&I will lead to future core deposit and fee growth.\"\nNoninterest expense and taxes Noninterest expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $108.6 million, compared to $123.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $62.1 million in the first quarter last year, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 75.0 percent. Salaries and employee benefits were $63.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $63.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $38.4 million in the first quarter of last year, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 66.1 percent. Included in salaries and employee benefits are costs related to the firm’s annual cash incentive plan. Incentive costs for this plan amounted to $5.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $6.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $2.5 million in the first quarter of last year. The firm employed 2,148.0 full-time equivalent associates at March 31. 2018. During the first quarter of 2018, eighteen positions were eliminated as a result of the merger with BNC Bancorp. No further reductions in the firm’s associate base are contemplated as a result of the firm’s merger with BNC Bancorp. The efficiency ratio for the first quarter of 2018 decreased to 49.7 percent, compared to 58.2 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017. The ratio of noninterest expenses to average assets decreased to 1.98 percent for the first quarter of 2018 from 2.22 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding investment securities gains and losses, merger-related charges and other real estate owned (ORE) expense, the efficiency ratio was 47.6 percent for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 47.2 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017, and the ratio of noninterest expense to average assets was 1.90 percent for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 1.87 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 19.0 percent, compared to 67.3 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 25.8 percent for the first quarter of 2017. The Tax Act reduced the aggregate blended Federal and state statutory income tax rate for Pinnacle from 39.23 percent to 26.14 percent. Fourth quarter 2017 effective tax rate included the impact of a $31.5 million charge related to the revaluation of the firm’s deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Act. Impacting Pinnacle’s effective tax rate was FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09, Stock Compensation Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Activity, which represented a change in accounting for the tax effects related to vesting of common shares and the exercise of stock options previously granted to the firm's employees through its various equity compensation plans. This change resulted in a reduction in first quarter 2018 tax expense of $2.7 million, compared to a reduction of $758,000 for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2017 and $3.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Inclusive of all of these matters, the firm anticipates an effective tax rate of between 21.0 and 22.0 percent for calendar year 2018.\n\"Our synergy case for the BNC Bancorp merger is for all practical purposes complete,\" Carpenter said. \"We are now at our target environment which will be subject to incremental adjustments as we manage the firm for continued growth. Noninterest expense, excluding merger-related charges, was less than we anticipated at approximately $103.2 million in the first quarter of 2018 attributable to a variety of factors including reduced incentives.\"\nAsset quality Nonperforming assets increased to 0.58 percent of total loans and ORE at March 31, 2018, compared to 0.55 percent at Dec. 31, 2017 and 0.36 percent at March 31, 2017. Nonperforming assets were $94.7 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $85.5 million at Dec. 31, 2017 and $31.3 million at March 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses represented 0.43 percent of total loans at March 31, 2018 and Dec. 31, 2017, compared to 0.68 percent at March 31, 2017 due primarily to the merger with BNC Bancorp. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was 100.0 percent at March 31, 2018, compared to 117.0 percent at Dec. 31, 2017 and 232.9 percent at March 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, purchase credit impaired loans of $14.5 million, which were recorded at fair value upon acquisition, represent 20.6 percent of our nonperforming loans. Net charge-offs were $4.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $4.2 million for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2017 and $4.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were 0.10 percent, compared to 0.13 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 0.20 percent for the first quarter of 2017. Provision for loan losses was $6.9 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $6.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $3.7 million in the first quarter of 2017.\n\"Overall, asset quality for our firm remains exceptional,\" Carpenter said. \"As we had projected last quarter, our commercial real estate to total risk-based capital ratio increased during the first quarter of 2018 and amounts to 306.2 percent at March 31, 2018 due in part to an anticipated increase in construction lending. We continue to believe this ratio will remain above 300 percent of total capital during the first half of 2018 before falling back within our long-term operating range of less than 300 percent of total capital during the last half of 2018.\"\nINVESTOR DAY\nPinnacle will be hosting an investor day for institutional investors and sell side analysts in Nashville, TN on June 7, 2018.

Pinnacle Financial disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this press release, which speak only as of the date hereof, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nNon-GAAP Financial Matters\nThis release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including, without limitation, revenues per diluted share, earnings per diluted share, efficiency ratio, core net interest margin, noninterest expense and the ratio of noninterest expense to average assets and noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income, in each case excluding the impact of expenses related to other real estate owned, gains or losses on sale of investments, the revaluation of Pinnacle Financial’s deferred tax assets and other matters for the accounting periods presented. This release also includes non-GAAP financial measures which exclude expenses associated with Pinnacle Bank's mergers with CapitalMark Bank & Trust, Magna Bank, Avenue Financial Holdings, Inc. and BNC, as well as Pinnacle Financial's and its bank subsidiary's investments in BHG. This release may also contain certain other non-GAAP capital ratios and performance measures. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of goodwill and core deposit intangibles associated with Pinnacle Financial's acquisitions of BNC, Avenue, Magna Bank, CapitalMark Bank & Trust, Mid-America Bancshares, Inc., Cavalry Bancorp, Inc. and other acquisitions which collectively are less material to the non-GAAP measure. The presentation of the non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any measure prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release are not measurements determined in accordance with GAAP and are susceptible to varying calculations, these non-GAAP financial measures, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\nPinnacle Financial believes that these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate making period-to-period comparisons and are meaningful indications of its operating performance.

PINNACLE FINANCIAL PARTNERS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA – UNAUDITED 1. Ratios are presented on an annualized basis. 2. Net interest margin is the result of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis divided by average interest earning assets. 3. Total revenue is equal to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income. 4. Efficiency ratios are calculated by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income. 5. Troubled debt restructurings include loans where the company, as a result of the borrower's financial difficulties, has granted a credit concession to the borrower (i.e., interest only payments for a significant period of time, extending the maturity of the loan, etc.). All of these loans continue to accrue interest at the contractual rate. 6. Average risk ratings are based on an internal loan review system which assigns a numeric value of 1 to 10 to all loans to commercial entities based on their underlying risk characteristics as of the end of each quarter. A \"1\" risk rating is assigned to credits that exhibit Excellent risk characteristics, \"2\" exhibit Very Good risk characteristics, \"3\" Good, \"4\" Satisfactory, \"5\" Acceptable or Average, \"6\" Watch List, \"7\" Criticized, \"8\" Classified or Substandard, \"9\" Doubtful and \"10\" Loss (which are charged-off immediately). Additionally, loans rated \"8\" or worse that are not nonperforming or restructured loans are considered potential problem loans. Generally, consumer loans are not subjected to internal risk ratings. Data presented represents legacy Pinnacle portfolio at period end date. 7. Annualized net loan charge-offs to average loans ratios are computed by annualizing quarter-to-date net loan charge-offs and dividing the result by average loans for the quarter-to-date period. 8. Capital ratios are calculated using regulatory reporting regulations enacted for such period and are defined as follows: Equity to total assets – End of period total stockholders' equity as a percentage of end of period assets. Tangible common equity to total assets - End of period total stockholders' equity less end of period goodwill, core deposit and other intangibles as a percentage of end of period assets. Leverage – Tier one capital (pursuant to risk-based capital guidelines) as a percentage of adjusted average assets. Tier one risk-based – Tier one capital (pursuant to risk-based capital guidelines) as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets. Total risk-based – Total capital (pursuant to risk-based capital guidelines) as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets. Classified asset - Classified assets as a percentage of Tier 1 capital plus allowance for loan losses. Tier one common equity to risk weighted assets - Tier 1 capital (pursuant to risk-based capital guidelines) less the amount of any preferred stock or subordinated indebtedness that is considered as a component of Tier 1 capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets. 9. Book value per share computed by dividing total stockholders' equity by common shares outstanding. 10. Amounts are included in the statement of operations in \"Gains on mortgage loans sold, net\", net of commissions paid on such amounts.\n11. At fair value, based on information obtained from Pinnacle's third party broker/dealer for non-FDIC insured financial products and services. 12. Core deposits include all transaction deposit accounts, money market and savings accounts and all certificates of deposit issued in a denomination of less than $250,000. The ratio noted above represents total core deposits divided by total funding, which includes total deposits, FHLB advances, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, subordinated indebtedness and all other interest-bearing liabilities. 13. Associate retention rate is computed by dividing the number of associates employed at quarter end less the number of associates that have resigned in the last 12 months by the number of associates employed at quarter end. Associate retention rate does not include associates at acquired institutions displaced by merger. 14. Adjusted pre-tax, pre-provision income excludes the impact of investment gains and losses on sales and impairments of securities, net, as well as other real estate owned expenses and income and merger-related charges. 15. Represents investment gains (losses) on sales and impairments, net occurring as a result of both credit losses and losses incurred as the result of a change in management's intention to sell a bond prior to the recovery of its amortized cost basis. 16. The dividend payout ratio is calculated as the sum of the annualized dividend rate divided by the trailing 12-months fully diluted earnings per share as of the dividend declaration date. 17. Earnings from equity method investment includes the impact of the issuance of subordinated debt as well as the funding costs of the overall franchise. Income tax expense is calculated using statutory tax rates. 18. Tax effect calculated using the blended statutory rate of 39.23% for all periods prior to 2018. For 2018, tax effect calculated using the blended statutory rate of 26.14%. 19. Calculated using the same guidelines as are used in the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council's Uniform Bank Performance Report.\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180416006568/en/\nPinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.\nMedia Contact:\nJoe Bass, 615-743-8219\nor\nFinancial Contact:\nHarold Carpenter, 615-744-3742\nWebsite:\nwww.pnfp.com\nSource: Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.",
