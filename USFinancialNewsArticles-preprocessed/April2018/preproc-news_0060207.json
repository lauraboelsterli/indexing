    "text": "April 30, 2018 / 7:33 AM / Updated 37 minutes ago Sainsbury's/Asda merger shakes up retail, European shares rise Helen Reid 4 Min Read\nLONDON (Reuters) - A multi-billion pound merger between British supermarket Sainsbury’s and Asda shook up retail stocks on Monday while European benchmarks rose, on track to end the month of April with a gain. FILE PHOTO: Traders prepare before the opening of the German stock exchange in front of the empty DAX board, at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, June 24, 2016. REUTERS/Staff/Remote/File Photo\nThe pan-European STOXX index rose 0.1 percent while Germany’s DAX gained 0.3 percent, buoyed by investors’ improved risk appetite as tensions eased between North and South Korea, and companies delivered strong earnings figures.\nThe STOXX was on course for a 3.8 percent gain for the month, after suffering losses in February and March.\nIn Europe all eyes were on Sainsbury’s, whose shares shot up at the open, trading up 14.9 percent by 0828 GMT after the British supermarket to buy Walmart’s Asda for about 7.3 billion pounds to create Britain’s biggest supermarket group by market share.\nThe stock was on track for its best one-day gain ever.\n“The merger, if successful, creates a retail giant in the UK with enough procurement and distribution scale to dominate food retail and challenge Amazon in non-food,” said Berenberg analysts.\nWalmart’s scale, Argos e-commerce capabilities and cross fulfilment synergies (between food and non-food) potentially challenge Amazon’s e-commerce dominance in the UK, they added.\nTesco, whose position as UK leader in terms of market share would be overtaken by the new merged group, tumbled 1.3 percent on the news. Morrisons also fell 1.3 percent.\nThe reaction among European retailers was more mixed, however, with France’s Carrefour gaining 0.4 percent and Casino rising 1.1 percent while Ahold Delhaize declined 0.7 percent.\nIn other deal news, Deutsche Telekom shares rose 1.5 percent to the top of the DAX after the German firm clinched a $26 billion deal to merge T-Mobile US and Sprint.\nAccorHotels rose to the top of France’s CAC 40, up 1.6 percent after the hotel chain agreed to buy rival Movenpick Hotels & Resorts for $567 million.\nIn results-driven moves, the world’s biggest advertising group WPP surged up 9 percent after reporting forecast-beating sales in its first results without founder Martin Sorrell.\nThe agency’s gains boosted the pan-European media sector up 1 percent. Financials, the most sensitive to investors’ risk appetite, were the biggest driver of the STOXX.\nOne drag on the banks sector was Sweden’s SEB, which tumbled 3.8 percent after reporting first-quarter profit below market expectations as cautious corporate customers and a seasonal slowdown hampered earnings.\nFrench construction materials firm Imerys also fell 5.2 percent after reporting results.\nOverall Europe’s first-quarter results season has kicked off relatively weakly, particularly compared to the first quarter of 2017 which saw strong growth.\nEarnings have surprised negatively, on average, in the banking sector, while commodity-related sectors have reported surprisingly strong results thanks to higher materials prices, according to Goldman Sachs.\nSociete Generale analysts struck a note of caution about investors’ high expectations of earnings. “Optimistic consensus earnings growth for the next three years could be a source of disappointment,” they wrote in a note entitled “Reality check”.
