    "text": "A federal judge on Tuesday ordered \"pharma bro\" scammer Martin Shkreli to immediately pay a defrauded hedge fund investor about $388,000 in restitution, roughly half of what the investor asked for. \nThe order comes a month after Judge Kiyo Matsumoto sentenced Shkreli to seven years in prison for defrauding that investor, Richard Kocher, and a number other people, as well as for conspiring to manipulate stock shares.\nIn addition to his prison sentence, Matsumoto also imposed a fine of $75,000 on the 35-year-old Shkreli and ordered him to forfeit almost $7.4 million in assets to the federal government.\nKocher, a New Jersey builder, was the only one of Shkreli's investors to seek restitution for damages from the crimes.\nThose crimes were related to Shkreli misleading Kocher and other investors about key details of his two hedge fund funds, sending them phony financial performance statements and refusing to redeem their investments when they asked.\nBoth funds effectively went belly up after Shkreli's purported stock-picking acumen turned out to be a charade.\nBut the investors ended up getting back their original investments, and even more money, after Shkreli paid them off with a combination of stock and cash from a new pharmaceuticals company he had founded, Retrophin .\nShkreli's lawyer Benjamin Brafman had argued that given that fact, none of the investors were entitled to restitution under the law.\nBut Kocher, who had originally invested $200,000 in Shkreli's fund, claimed he was entitled to nearly $779,000 in restitution.\nThat claim was based on the fact that Shkreli delayed, for months, repaying Kocher his investment stake when Kocher told him in early 2013 he needed it to finance a real-estate deal in New Jersey.\nKocher said that because he was not able to get his money back from Shkreli when he needed it, he was forced to take on a partner in the transaction.\nAnd when the deal came to fruition, Kocher has said, he had to pay that partner $769,477 as a share of its profits.\n\"Had Mr. Shkreli not defrauded Mr. Kocher, Mr. Kocher would have been able to use his own money as funding for the real estate investment, and would not have had to take on a partner,\" Matsumoto noted in her order Tuesday.\nKocher asked Matsumoto to order Shkreli to pay him what Kocher had to give his partner for the deal. He also wanted Shkreli to cover the legal costs he incurred in trying to redeem his MSMB investment and more than $200 in costs related to his testimony at Shkreli's trial.\nMatsumoto, however, said that Shkreli would have to pay Kochher only $388,336.49.\nThat amount, the judge noted, represents Kocher's lost profits from the real-estate delay and his legal costs related to the hedge-fund fraud, less the value of the $390,421.14 in Retrophin stock and cash he previously got as a settlement from Shkreli. \nA message left at Kocher's office requesting comment on Matsumoto's order was not immediately answered.\nShkreli's lawyer Brafman declined to comment on the order.\nBrafman last month filed a notice of appeal of Shkreli's conviction.\nThat appeal will play out while Shkreli remains locked up in federal custody in a Brooklyn jail, where he has been since last September.\nShkreli landed in jail when Matsumoto revoked his $5 million bail after saying he represented a threat because of his offer of a $5,000 bounty for each strand of hair from the head of Hillary Clinton provided to him by his Facebook followers.\nThe U.S. Bureau of Prisons has yet to disclose where it intends to send Shkreli to serve the remainder of his sentence.\nBrafman has asked for Shkreli to do his time in a minimum-security federal camp adjacent to the U.S Penitentiary Canaan in northeastern Pennsylvania , or another such facility near New York City. Matsumoto has endorsed Brafman's request, but her recommendation is not binding.\nShkreli gained notoriety in 2015 while heading another drug company, then known as Turing Pharmaceuticals, and raising the price of its drug Daraprim by more than 5,000 percent . The drug is used to treat a parasitic condition found in pregnant women, babies and HIV-infected people.",
