    "text": "April 11, 2018 / 6:38 AM / Updated 34 minutes ago UK's Ofgem launches probe into Cadent's record keeping Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nApril 11 (Reuters) - Britain’s gas and electricity markets regulator Ofgem said on Wednesday it launched an investigation into British gas distribution business Cadent’s record keeping. \nThe Office of Gas and Electricity Markets said it would investigate if Cadent failed to keep records of gas pipes (risers) in some blocks of flats that are part of its network. \nOfgem is also investigating whether Cadent kept and maintained records for all of its risers and whether it has the appropriate systems in place to do so. \nCadent, formerly National Grid Gas Distribution, owns the gas distribution networks in north London, central England, the east of England and northwest England. It was renamed in May after National Grid sold the majority stake to a consortium. (Reporting by Arathy S Nair in Bengaluru; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier)",
