    "text": "- Pre-Clinical Data Presented at 2018 American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting Confirms A Broad Spectrum of Potent Inhibition of KIT and PDGFRα Mutations in Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST) and Systemic Mastocytosis (SM) -\nWALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:DCPH), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on addressing key mechanisms of tumor drug resistance, today announced pre-clinical data for DCC-2618 confirming a broad spectrum of potent inhibition across primary and secondary KIT mutations and primary PDGFRα mutations. Compared to the FDA approved and investigational compounds tested in this pre-clinical study, DCC-2618 demonstrated the broadest profile of inhibition of primary and secondary KIT mutations and primary PDGFRα mutations. The data will be presented today at the 2018 American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting in Chicago, IL in a poster titled “Inhibition of oncogenic and drug-resistant PDGFRA and KIT alterations by DCC-2618”.\nDeciphera is currently evaluating DCC-2618 in multiple clinical studies including INVICTUS, a Phase 3 pivotal study in 4 th line and 4 th line plus GIST patients, and in a Phase 1 study in other KIT and/or PDGFRα-driven diseases, including 2 nd line to 4 th line plus GIST, SM, glioblastoma multiforme and other cancers. Deciphera expects to initiate a Phase 3 registration study in 2 nd line GIST patients in the second half of 2018 and to report top-line data from the ongoing INVICTUS study in 2019.\n“In GIST patients receiving FDA approved therapies, secondary drug resistance KIT mutations frequently result in disease progression. Our pre-clinical results confirm that among the kinase inhibitors tested, both approved and investigational, DCC-2618 exhibits the broadest profile of inhibition against these heterogenous, difficult to treat mutations,” said Michael D. Taylor, Ph.D., Deciphera’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “A significant need exists for therapies with the potential to address both activating mutations and other genetic alterations in KIT and PDGFRα, which have been identified in >85% of patients with GIST and >90% of patients with systemic mastocytosis.”\nThese data describe the breadth of inhibition achieved with DCC-2618 and its active metabolite, DP-5439, across both primary and secondary KIT mutations and primary PDGFRα mutations compared to the in vitro profiles of the FDA-approved kinase inhibitors, imatinib, sunitinib, regorafenib, midostaurin and the investigational agent, avapritinib (BLU-285). Highlights from the poster include:\nDCC-2618, a Type II switch control kinase inhibitor of KIT and PDGFRα, broadly inhibits KIT mutants in exons 9, 11, 13, 14 17, and 18 and PDGFRα mutants in exons 12, 14, and 18, forcing even aggressively activated kinase mutants into a Type II inactive conformation. Compared to the approved and investigational compounds tested, DCC-2618 and its active metabolite, DP-5439, exhibit the broadest profile of inhibition across primary and secondary drug-resistant KIT mutations, and primary PDGFRα mutations. Other Type II inhibitors, such as imatinib, sunitinib and regorafenib, do not broadly inhibit KIT exon-17 mutations or mutations in PDGRFα while Type I inhibitors, such as avapritinib (BLU-285), have weaker activity against KIT mutations in exons 13 and 14. DCC-2618 also exhibited a superior exon 9 KIT mutation profile compared to imatinib, sunitinib, and avapritinib (BLU-285), including complex KIT mutations involving exon 9 coupled with secondary KIT mutations in exons 13, 14, and 17. In enzyme assays at relevant cellular levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), DCC-2618 broadly inhibited primary and drug-resistant KIT mutants and primary PDGFRα mutants. DCC-2618 also broadly inhibited KIT and PDGFRα mutations in a panel of GIST, mastocytosis, leukemia, lung cancer, and transfected cell assays, as well as in various in vivo xenograft models. As previously reported, translational liquid biopsy data from the Phase 1 clinical trial has shown that in heavily pre-treated GIST patients, many of whom had received all three of the FDA approved drugs for GIST, DCC-2618 decreased mutant KIT circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) across the spectrum of KIT exons 9, 11, 13, 14, 17, and 18.\nAbout DCC-2618\nDCC-2618 is a KIT and PDGFRα kinase switch control inhibitor in clinical development for the treatment of KIT and/or PDGFRα-driven cancers, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors, systemic mastocytosis and glioblastoma multiforme. DCC-2618 was specifically designed to improve the treatment of GIST patients by inhibiting a broad spectrum of mutations in KIT and PDGFRα. DCC-2618 is a KIT and PDGFRα inhibitor that blocks initiating KIT mutations in exons 9, 11, 13, 14, 17, and 18, involved in GIST as well as the primary D816V exon 17 mutation involved in SM. DCC-2618 also inhibits primary PDGFRα mutations in exons 12, 14,and 18, including the exon 18 D842V mutation, involved in a subset of GIST.\nAbout Deciphera Pharmaceuticals\nDeciphera Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on improving the lives of cancer patients by tackling key mechanisms of drug resistance that limit the rate and/or durability of response to existing cancer therapies. Our small molecule drug candidates are directed against an important family of enzymes called kinases, known to be directly involved in the growth and spread of many cancers. We use our deep understanding of kinase biology together with a proprietary chemistry library to purposefully design compounds that maintain kinases in a “switched off” or inactivated conformation. These investigational therapies comprise tumor-targeted agents designed to address therapeutic resistance causing mutations and immuno-targeted agents designed to control the activation of immunokinases that suppress critical immune system regulators, such as macrophages. We have used our platform to develop a diverse pipeline of tumor-targeted and immuno-targeted drug candidates designed to improve outcomes for patients with cancer by improving the quality, rate and/or durability of their responses to treatment.\nAvailability of Other Information About Deciphera Pharmaceuticals\nInvestors and others should note that Deciphera Pharmaceuticals communicates with its investors and the public using its company website ( www.deciphera.com ), including but not limited to investor presentations and scientific presentations, Securities and Exchange Commission filings, press releases, public conference calls and webcasts.
