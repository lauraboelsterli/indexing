(NASDAQ:BRKL) (the “Company”) today announced net income of $18.6 million, or $0.24 per basic and diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $6.8 million, or $0.09 per basic and diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, and $13.4 million, or $0.19 per basic and diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017. Excluding merger charges and securities gains for the first quarter of 2018, the Company had operating earnings of $20.0 million, or $0.26 per basic and diluted share.\n“Brookline Bancorp continued to exhibit strong performance in the quarter,” said Paul Perrault, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. “The acquisition of First Commons Bank was completed on schedule, thanks to the hard work of both teams. Our positive momentum continues as we go into the second quarter.”\nFirst Commons Bank Acquisition\nOn March 1, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of First Commons Bank, N.A., which was merged into Brookline Bank. The acquisition included two locations which will be consolidated into existing Brookline Bank locations in Newton Centre and Wellesley, Massachusetts on June 1, 2018. The transaction included the acquisition of $262.1 million in loans and the assumption of $273.7 million in deposits, each at fair value. Total consideration of $56.0 million consisted of 3,481,477 shares of Brookline Bancorp, Inc. common stock issued to First Commons Bank shareholders, as well as $851 thousand in cash, inclusive of cash in lieu for fractional shares and warrants.\nBALANCE SHEET\nTotal assets at March 31, 2018 increased $467.9 million to $7.25 billion from $6.78 billion at December 31, 2017, and increased $750.4 million from $6.50 billion at March 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, total loans and leases were $6.11 billion, representing an increase of $383.8 million from December 31, 2017, and an increase of $652.7 million from March 31, 2017. During the first quarter of 2018, total loans and leases increased 26.8 percent on an annualized basis. Excluding the First Commons Bank acquired loans at fair value; loans increased $121.7 million during the quarter or 8.5 percent on an annualized basis.\nInvestment securities at March 31, 2018 increased $25.9 million to $675.7 million, comprising 9.3 percent of total assets, as compared to $649.9 million, or 9.6 percent of total assets, at December 31, 2017, and increased approximately $46.6 million from $629.1 million, or 9.7 percent of total assets, at March 31, 2017.\nTotal deposits at March 31, 2018 increased $320.2 million to $5.19 billion from $4.87 billion at December 31, 2017 and increased $539.6 million from $4.65 billion at March 31, 2017. Excluding the First Commons Bank acquired deposits at fair value; deposits increased $46.5 million during the quarter or 3.8 percent on an annualized basis.\nTotal borrowings at March 31, 2018 increased $78.6 million to $1.10 billion from $1.02 billion at December 31, 2017 and increased $42.6 million from $1.06 billion at March 31, 2017.\nThe ratio of stockholders’ equity to total assets was 11.94 percent at March 31, 2018, as compared to 11.86 percent at December 31, 2017, and 10.83 percent at March 31, 2017, respectively. The ratio of tangible stockholders’ equity to tangible assets was 9.85 percent at March 31, 2018, as compared to 9.94 percent at December 31, 2017, and 8.79 percent at March 31, 2017. Tangible book value per share increased $0.08 from $8.61 at December 31, 2017 to $8.69 at March 31, 2018.\nNET INTEREST INCOME\nNet interest income increased $1.8 million to $59.5 million during the first quarter of 2018 from the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The net interest margin increased 7 basis points to 3.66 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nNON-INTEREST INCOME\nNon-interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased $0.4 million to $6.2 million from $5.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily driven by $1.2 million in gain on sales of securities, offset by a decrease of $0.6 million in gain on sales of loans and leases and a decrease of $0.2 million in other non-interest income.\nPROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nThe Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $0.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $1.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in the provision for the quarter was primarily driven by charge-offs on commercial relationships, primarily taxi medallion loans, in the prior quarter.\nNet charge-offs for the first quarter of 2018 were $0.5 million compared to $8.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans and leases on an annualized basis decreased to 3 basis points for the first quarter of 2018 from 60 basis points for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses represented 0.96 percent of total loans and leases at March 31, 2018, compared to 1.02 percent at December 31, 2017, and 1.21 percent at March 31, 2017. The allowance for loan and lease losses related to originated loans and leases represented 1.03 percent of originated loans and leases at March 31, 2018, compared to 1.05 percent at December 31, 2017, and 1.25 percent at March 31, 2017.\nNON-INTEREST EXPENSE\nNon-interest expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased $4.8 million to $39.9 million from $35.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily driven by an increase of $1.7 million in compensation and employee benefits, an increase of $0.4 million in occupancy, and an increase of $2.7 million in merger and acquisition expense.\nPROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES\nThe effective tax rate was 22.5 percent and 70.6 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate for both periods is reflective of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nRETURNS ON AVERAGE ASSETS AND AVERAGE EQUITY\nThe annualized return on average assets increased to 1.08 percent during the first quarter of 2018 from 0.41 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017.

The annualized return on average tangible stockholders’ equity increased to 11.01 percent for the first quarter of 2018 from 4.09 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nASSET QUALITY\nThe ratio of nonperforming loans and leases to total loans and leases was 0.43 percent at March 31, 2018 as compared to 0.48 percent at December 31, 2017. Nonperforming loans and leases decreased $1.0 million to $26.3 million at March 31, 2018 from $27.3 million at December 31, 2017.

Nonperforming assets decreased $1.4 million to $30.2 million at March 31, 2018 from $31.7 million at December 31, 2017.\nDIVIDEND DECLARED\nThe Company’s Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.10 per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, an increase of 11.1 percent. The dividend will be paid on May 25, 2018 to stockholders of record on May 11, 2018.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nThe Company will conduct a conference call/webcast at 1:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time on Thursday, April 26, 2018 to discuss the results for the quarter, business highlights and outlook.
