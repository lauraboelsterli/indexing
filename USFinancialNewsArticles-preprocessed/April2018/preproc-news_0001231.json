Morgan and UBS to help it review its options regarding its investment in GTC.\nLone Star does not plan to sell any of its shares in GTC on the stock exchange via an accelerated book building, GTC added in the statement.\nShares in GTC, whose portfolio includes real-estate assets in Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Serbia, gained almost 20 percent last year, but have fallen by around 7 percent since the start of 2018, valuing the company at around 4.31 billion zlotys ($1.26 billion).\nReporting by Agnieszka Barteczko, editing by Louise Heavens\n ",
