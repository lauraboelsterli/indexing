Last week, net dollar shorts were at $22.77 billion. \nU.S. dollar positioning was derived from net contracts of International Monetary Market speculators in the yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc and Canadian and Australian dollars. \nEuro net longs, meanwhile, rose to a record high of 151,476 contracts, CFTC data showed.
