    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Endeavour Silver Corp. (NYSE:EXK) (TSX:EDR) announces the filing of a final short form base shelf prospectus (“Prospectus”) to provide the Company with the flexibility to take advantage of debt, convertible debt, equity and other financing opportunities that may arise during the 25‑month period effective period of the Prospectus. The Company’s existing base shelf prospectus dated May 3, 2016 has been withdrawn.\nThe Prospectus has been filed in each of the provinces and territories of Canada, except Quebec, and a corresponding shelf registration statement on Form F‑10 (“Registration Statement”) was also filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). These filings enable offerings of common shares, warrants, subscription receipts, debt and convertible debt securities or units of up to an aggregate initial offering price of CAD$150 million at any time during the period the Prospectus is effective.\nCopies of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus contained therein can be obtained by contacting Endeavour Silver at Suite 1130‑609 Granville Street, Vancouver, British Columbia V7Y 1G5, Attention: Daniel Dickson, Chief Financial Officer. Copies of the Prospectus and the Registration Statement are also available at www.sedar.com and www.sec.gov , respectively.\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell any securities or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities, nor will there be any sale of the securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. If any securities are offered under the Prospectus or Registration Statement the terms of any such securities and the intended use of any net proceeds will be established at the time of any such offering and will be described in a Prospectus supplement filed with the applicable Canadian securities regulatory authorities and the SEC at the time of any such an offering and would be made available by Endeavour at the above address.\nAbout Endeavour Silver – Endeavour Silver Corp. is a mid-tier precious metals mining company that operates three high-grade, underground, silver-gold mines in Mexico.

Since forward‑looking statements are not statements of historical fact and address future events, conditions and expectations, forward‑looking statements by their nature inherently involve unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors well beyond the Company’s ability to control or predict. Actual events, results and developments may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward‑looking statements. Material factors that could cause actual events to differ materially from those described in such forwarding‑looking statements include risks related to the Company's Registration Statement not becoming effective, risks related to the Company's condition requiring anticipated use of proceeds to change, timing of, and ability to obtain, required regulatory approvals, and general economic and regulatory changes.\nThese forward‑looking statements represent the Company's views as of the date of this release. There can be no assurance that forward‑looking statements will prove to be accurate, as actual events and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Readers should not place undue reliance on any forward‑looking statements.\nSource:Endeavour Silver Corporation",
