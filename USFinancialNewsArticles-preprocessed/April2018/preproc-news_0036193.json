    "text": "NEW YORK, April 18, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Once a California-based \"black market\" holiday, April 20 th , or \"4/20\" is now seen by many in the cannabis community as a day of celebration and validation. And so far, in 2018, there is plenty to celebrate.\nLast week, former Speaker of the House, John Boehner and Former Governor of Massachusetts, Bill Weld, joined the Advisory Board of Acreage Holdings . Days later, President Donald Trump confirmed to Colorado Senator Corey Gardner that he would protect the states' rights to choose how to handle the legalization of cannabis, for the most part, de-risking the industry from federal prosecution.\nTo help make sense of the rapidly evolving industry, Anne Donohoe and Lewis Goldberg, co-hosts of The Green Rush podcast, KCSA's weekly, 30-minute show covering the business of cannabis, continue to speak with industry-leading CEOs, politicians, journalists, analysts, former professional athletes and cultural icons.\nIn a rare surprise for the 4/20 holiday, Green Rush listeners will be treated to two episodes this week. The first episode, slated for release today, Wednesday April 18, features Kevin \"Murph\" Murphy, CEO of Acreage Holdings . Mr. Murphy will talk about one of the biggest news stories in cannabis this year: the addition of John Boehner and Bill Weld to its Board of Advisors.\nOn Friday, in celebration of 4/20, The Green Rush will release a very special episode: our discussion with music and cannabis royalty, eight-time Grammy Award Winner, Ziggy Marley . Ms. Donohoe and co-host, Green Rush producer Nick Opich, talk with Mr. Marley about his role in the cultural revolution of cannabis, started by his dad, Bob Marley, and how he is continuing the legacy.\nRecent highlights from the show also include:\nFormer NBA star Al Harrington talks about changing former NBA Commissioner David Stern's mind on medical cannabis and its therapeutic uses for players, his expanding empire, and the influence of his grandmother on his Viola Extracts brand. Kris Krane, Co-Founder and President of 4Front Ventures spoke about his deep cannabis roots and his journey from long-time activist and advocate to thriving cannapreneur. Ricardo Baca talks about being the first-ever cannabis editor at a major American newspaper and the intersection and evolution of cannabis in the media and the role that reporting plays.\nThe Green Rush is a weekly, 30-minute show about the business of Cannabis with new episodes released each week where Ms. Donohoe and Mr. Goldberg talk to newsmakers on the front lines who are building the legal cannabis market.
