    "text": "BLOOMFIELD HILLS, Mich., April 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Penske Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE: PAG), an international transportation services company, today announced record first quarter results. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, income from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders increased 29.8% to $108.0 million, and related earnings per share increased 29.9% to $1.26 when compared to the same period last year. The results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 include a net benefit totaling $1.0 million after tax, or $0.01 per share, consisting of a $6.4 million net gain related to several retail automotive dealership actions including the sale of five locations and the termination of several franchises, partially offset by valuation adjustments on certain properties totaling $5.4 million.\nOn January 1, 2018, the company adopted ASC 606 for revenue recognition. The net impact of adopting ASC 606 in the first quarter of 2018 was an increase to net income of $0.4 million. Additionally, as a result of tax reform enacted in 2017, the company's effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2018 was 25.4% compared to 33.0% in the first quarter of 2017.\nTotal automotive retail unit volume increased 6.4% and total revenue increased 13.1% to $5.7 billion. Excluding foreign exchange, total revenue increased 7.3%. Foreign exchange positively impacted earnings per share by $0.06 during the first quarter.\n\"I'm pleased to report another quarter of record results,\" said Penske Automotive Group Chairman Roger S. Penske. \"The record results were driven by outstanding performance across each area of our business, demonstrating the strength of our diversified transportation services model. A 6.4% increase in retail automotive unit sales, a 37.7% same-store retail revenue increase in the company's North American retail commercial truck business, the growth of the stand-alone used vehicle supercenter operations, and the investment in Penske Truck Leasing contributed to the record first quarter. Furthermore, I am particularly pleased to report a 100 basis point improvement in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of gross profit and gross profit flow-through of nearly 32%, demonstrating the strong expense leverage our model is capable of producing.\"\nAutomotive Retail Highlights of the First Quarter\nRetail Unit Sales +6.4% to 132,490 New Retail Units -4.7% Used Retail Units +17.6% Same-Store Retail Unit Sales +0.4% to 111,240 New Retail Units -1.6% Used Retail Units +2.5% Same-Store Retail Revenue +8.5%; Excluding Foreign Exchange +2.7% New +6.7%; Used +11.4%; Finance & Insurance +10.4%; Service and Parts +8.0% Same-Store Average Gross Profit Per Unit New $3,039, +$110/unit; Gross Margin 7.4%, -30 basis points Excluding Foreign Exchange $2,864, -$65/unit Used $1,607, +$57/unit; Gross Margin 5.5%, -30 basis points Excluding Foreign Exchange $1,515, -$35/unit Finance & Insurance $1,238, +$113/unit Excluding Foreign Exchange $1,177, +$52/unit Same-Store Variable Gross Profit Per Unit $3,590, +$183/unit Excluding Foreign Exchange $3,394, -$13/unit\nRetail Commercial Truck Operations\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the company's retail commercial truck operations retailed 2,105 units, generated $292.4 million of revenue, and $46.6 million of gross profit.
