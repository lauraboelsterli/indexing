    "text": "Calls on Board to Allow All Shareholders a Voice\nLOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (“Oaktree”), an 18.56% shareholder of Ranger Direct Lending Fund PLC (LON: RDL) (“Ranger” or the “Company”), sent a letter to the Ranger Board of Directors (the “Board”) earlier today regarding its ongoing strategic review process, urging the Board to allow all shareholders a vote on the crucial matters currently being decided by the Board.\nThe full text of the letter is as follows:\nApril 27, 2018\nRanger Direct Lending Board of Directors:\nMr. Christopher Waldron\nMr. Jonathan Schneider\nDr. Matthew Mulford\nMr. Scott Canon\nCC: Mr. Gavin Kelly, Kinmont Advisory\nDear Directors of Ranger Direct Lending,\nIn Ranger Direct Lending’s (“Ranger” or the “Company”) RNS dated April 24, the Ranger Board of Directors (the “Board”) disclosed that it is “engaged in an active and positive discussion with shareholders.” In the RNS the Board also said that it is essential “to achieve sufficient consensus between the Board and shareholders on the Company’s future direction.”\nOaktree strongly agrees with these sentiments. Ranger is at a critical juncture and facing major decisions that will impact future shareholder value. For this reason, we believe it is imperative that the Board give all shareholders a voice in these decisions through a full shareholder vote. We understand that you are required to hold a shareholder vote for any material change in investment policy; however, we urge you to publicly commit to a full shareholder vote on any future investment management arrangements with which the Board wishes to proceed, regardless of whether it is required.\nIn our April 11 letter to you, we outlined the structural challenges faced by Ranger as well as the clear shareholder benefits of a wind-down. At such an important time for the Company, we believe it is imperative for you to give all Ranger shareholders a voice in determining the path forward. This would demonstrate that the Board takes its fiduciary obligations to the Company seriously and is acting in the best interests of the Company and of its shareholders as a whole.\nConversely, we believe it would raise significant governance questions if the Board were to adopt a new long-term investment management arrangement – thereby locking in new fees and potentially risking disruption to the existing portfolio – without allowing all shareholders a voice on the matter in an open and transparent way.\nWe believe that the question of future shareholder value is important for all shareholders and accordingly we will be making this letter public.\nSincerely,\n/s/ Patrick M.
