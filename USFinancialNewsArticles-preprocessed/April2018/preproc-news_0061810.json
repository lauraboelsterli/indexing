    "text": "317 COMMENTS Is Starbucks the next Selma? Many in the race-grievance industry are trying to convince Americans that it is. The story began earlier this month, when two black men visited a Starbucks in an upscale Philadelphia neighborhood. They asked to use the restroom but refused to buy anything. When they were asked to leave the coffee shop, they refused, prompting the store manager to call the cops. When the two men also refused police orders to leave, they were handcuffed and arrested.\nThe scene was caught on cellphone videos that were soon posted online, sparking “civil rights” protests. The Washington Post’s editorial page editor, Fred Hiatt, writing from the site of Alabama’s new lynching memorial, ruminated on the “arc of the history of white supremacy from slavery to the arrest of two black men at a Starbucks in Philadelphia.” This is an outrageous comparison, and it trivializes not only the people who suffered during those most onerous and oppressive times but also the brave men and women who gave their lives confronting injustice.\nThose of us who marched during the civil-rights movement had clear goals. We demanded that blacks be left alone to exercise their right to live and work where they pleased. We demanded an end to segregation and to the many manifestations of racial discrimination. We were confronting real issues and working for concrete outcomes that would benefit all who had suffered discrimination, regardless of their station in life.\nWhat do the Starbucks protesters want? Who are the intended beneficiaries of their goals? Who are the losers? In response to the outrage, the Starbucks CEO came to Philadelphia to meet with the two aggrieved men. He apologized and pledged to close all the company’s 8,000 stores for a half-day of “racial sensitivity” training.\nIt’s easy to see who benefits from this kind of response: The consultants who devise and conduct sensitivity-training sessions. The civil-rights organizations that will get money from donors anxious to relieve their white guilt. The two young arrestees, who have already claimed their status as celebrity victims, probably leading to a talk-show tour and perhaps a legal settlement from Starbucks. Starbucks may come out of this a winner, too, if its mea culpa encourages more blacks to buy coffee at its citadel of racial justice.\nWho are the losers? Here’s an illustrative story: Some years ago, a trio of shoplifters was operating at an upscale department store near my home in Silver Spring, Md. One member, a young black man dressed in a jogging suit, would act as suspiciously as possible, picking up expensive garments as he looked around cautiously. This was intended to draw in the security guards, at which point a well-dressed white couple would gather up armfuls of designer apparel and slip out the door. The trio then would meet in the parking lot to divide the booty.\nThere are parallels between that scheme and what is going on with Starbucks. Although many of the young protesters may authentically believe they are rallying for racial justice, they are in fact playing the role of the decoy. They are a useful diversion for those who reap the profits of the race-grievance industry. Similarly, the continuing mantra of racism serves as a shield for black officials in cities where black neighborhoods have declined and decayed.\nWhile the media focuses on exaggerated instances of presumed racist discrimination, such as the plight of the two nonpurchasing “customers” at the coffee shop, far more grievous problems are ignored. I was born in Philadelphia, not far from where that Starbucks now stands. Back then it was a community that hundreds of low-income black families called home. My father died when I was 9, and I saw how the neighbors and the local fraternal organizations provided buffering support for my mother, who was striving to take care of her five children.\nGentrification in recent decades has brought not only Starbucks but an influx of upscale residents. As in most areas of Central South Philadelphia, low-income families have had to move out of their former neighborhoods. No voice has been raised in their defense, given that this shift was a result of housing policies in a city controlled for decades by black elected officials.\nBut these developments have had serious consequences for low-income blacks: Most have had to move to areas without the supportive community institutions that once provided them stability and resilience. The few families left behind live among the signals of their coming displacement—like the opening of another Starbucks. Here is the true tragedy in this sad morality play.\nMr. Woodson is founder and president of the Woodson Center.",
