    "text": "TORONTO, April 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - TorQuest Partners (\"TorQuest\") today announced the merger of Amenity Holdings Inc. (\"Amenity\"), the second platform investment of TorQuest Partners Fund IV, and Rubicon Pharmacies Canada Inc. (\"Rubicon\"), two complementary operators of retail pharmacies across Western Canada. Going forward, the combined company will do business as Rubicon Pharmacies. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.\nFounded in 2005 and headquartered in Weyburn, Saskatchewan, Rubicon owns and operates a network of 67 retail pharmacies located in rural towns and neighbourhood communities across Western Canada. Rubicon's pharmacies serve as a critical component of the health care delivery system in these geographies. Rubicon was established as a succession vehicle for owners of independent pharmacies and operates across a broad range of retail pharmacy banners. This transaction will provide liquidity to a number of long standing Rubicon shareholders.\nThe combined business will own over 100 pharmacies in the four Western Canadian provinces under a number of retail pharmacy banners and will bring together two industry leading management teams under the leadership of CEO Mike Wright. The combined business will continue to focus on acquiring and integrating additional independent pharmacies.\nDaniel Sonshine, a Partner at TorQuest, said, \"The combination of Amenity and Rubicon is a transformative merger that establishes the company as the leading independent pharmacy operator in Western Canada.

Management is looking forward to driving the next stage of the business's growth and is excited to align with TorQuest on our shared vision of building a leading Canadian pharmacy operator,\" said Mike Wright, CEO of Rubicon.\nAbout Rubicon Pharmacies Canada\nEstablished in 2005, Rubicon operates 67 pharmacies across Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan, primarily located in rural towns and neighbourhood communities of larger urban centres.
