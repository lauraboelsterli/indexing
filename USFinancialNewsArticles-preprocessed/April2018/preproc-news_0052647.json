    "text": "BATON ROUGE, La.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- H&E Equipment Services, Inc. (NASDAQ: HEES) today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 SUMMARY\nRevenues increased 14.8% to $260.5 million versus $226.8 million a year ago. Included in total revenues was $11.7 million from the legacy CEC business (“CEC”) which we acquired on January 1, 2018. Net income was $9.5 million in the first quarter compared to net income of $5.4 million a year ago. The effective income tax rate was 27.5% in the first quarter of 2018 and 36.8% in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA increased 17.7% to $80.9 million in the first quarter compared to $68.8 million a year ago, yielding a margin of 31.1% of revenues compared to 30.3% a year ago. CEC contributed EBITDA of $7.7 million with a margin of 66.5%. Rental revenues increased 20.5% to $129.4 million in the first quarter compared to $107.3 million a year ago. New equipment sales increased 35.7% to $46.5 million in the first quarter compared to $34.3 million a year ago. Used equipment sales decreased 13.9% to $24.9 million in the first quarter compared to $28.9 million a year ago. Gross margin was 35.5% compared to 34.2% a year ago. Rental gross margins were 47.6% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 44.8% a year ago. Average time utilization (based on original equipment cost) was 70.4% compared to 68.5% a year ago. Average rental rates increased 2.1% compared to a year ago and 0.2% sequentially. Dollar utilization was 34.7% in the first quarter compared to 32.4% a year ago. Average rental fleet age at March 31, 2018, was 34.9 months compared to an industry average age of 44.8 months. Acquired Rental Inc. on April 1, 2018, increasing branch count to 88.\nJohn Engquist, H&E Equipment Services’ chief executive officer, said, “The momentum in our rental business continued during the first quarter with revenues increasing 20.5% and margins increasing 280 basis points to 47.6% compared to the first quarter of last year. Physical utilization remained above year-ago levels, increasing to 70.4% compared to 68.5%, while rates increased 2.1%. The strong demand in our non-residential markets resulted in growth in the size of our rental fleet.”\nEngquist concluded, “We are excited about 2018 for our business and industry. Demand in the non-residential construction markets we serve is above year-ago levels and broad-based throughout our geographic footprint. In addition to solid general project activity, energy-related work in our Gulf Coast region is strong, benefitting both our rental and distribution businesses. With our recent acquisitions of CEC and Rental Inc., we have added eight branches thus far this year. Rapidly executing on our stated growth strategy is a high priority and we are continuing to explore additional acquisitions and market expansion through Greenfields and warm starts.”\nFINANCIAL DISCUSSION FOR FIRST QUARTER 2018:\nRevenue\nTotal revenues increased 14.8% to $260.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $226.8 million in the first quarter of 2017.
