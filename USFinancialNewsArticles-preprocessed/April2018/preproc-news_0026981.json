    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - The French presidency on Saturday issued a video on Twitter showing what it said were Rafale war planes taking off in an intervention against the chemical weapons facilities of the Syrian regime.\nIt was not immediately clear whether the planes were taking off from an aircraft carrier or a military base on land. The Elysee presidential palace did not specify where the planes were taking off and provided no further details.\nThe video was published shortly after president Emmanuel Macron ordered a military intervention in Syria alongside the United States and Britain.\nReporting by Geert De Clercq and Jean-Baptiste Vey; Writing by Matthias Blamont; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\n ",
