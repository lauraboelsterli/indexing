    "text": "You may be disappointed with the size of your Social Security check in retirement.\nTo that point, 27 percent of retirees said their payments are less than they expected, according to the latest Social Security survey conducted by Nationwide Retirement Institute.\nAt the same time, aspiring retirees said they expect to receive $1,628 per month on average. But current retirees are receiving an average of $1,257 per month.\nThat 30 percent difference can be a really big deal for retirees who do not anticipate that shortfall, according to Tina Ambrozy, president of sales and distribution at Nationwide.\n\"There's a huge disconnect between what those folks who are approaching retirement believe their retirement will cover and what it will cover,\" Ambrozy said. \"The gap is pretty significant.\"\nMore from Fixed Income Strategies:\nWhere the bonds are: The outlook for fixed income\nAnnuity illustrations aren't always what they seem\nPassive investing hums with activity as ETFs evolve\nThat comes as income from Social Security benefits is expected to be a large chunk — if not the main source — of funds for many retirees. More than half of the individuals surveyed — 55 percent — said Social Security benefits will be their main source of income in retirement.\nThose survey results come from 1,013 individuals ages 50 and up.\nBefore you retire, there are several things you can do to bridge your Social Security confidence — and income — gap.\nHave a clear understanding of your benefits The longer you wait to claim Social Security up until age 70, the larger your benefits will be.\nAge 62 is when you are first eligible to claim your Social Security retirement benefits, but you will receive less for claiming early.\nFull retirement age — which is currently 66 or 67, depending on the year in which you were born — is when you are eligible to receive 100 percent of the benefits you earned.\nFor each year you delay Social Security benefits from your full retirement age until 70, you get an 8 percent boost to your benefits.\nWhile many of Nationwide's survey respondents said they planned to wait until 66, most actually claim their benefits at 62.\n\"There's four years between when they thought they were going to start collecting and when they actually are collecting,\" Ambrozy said. \"That has a huge impact on their income that they're drawing for the rest of their life.\"\nshow chapters",
