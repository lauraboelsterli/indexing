    "text": "EAU CLAIRE, Wis., April 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Citizens Community Bancorp, Inc. (the \"Company\") (Nasdaq:CZWI), the parent company of Citizens Community Federal N.A. (the “Bank”), today reported earnings increased 44% to $1.34 million, or $0.23 per diluted share in Q2 fiscal 2018, compared to $934,000, or $0.17 per diluted share one year earlier. The Q2 fiscal 2018 operations reflect continued investment in our commercial lending platform, including the addition of four commercial bankers offset by seasonally lower gain on sale income from mortgage originations in the quarter. The investment in commercial bankers resulted in approximately $210,000 recorded in both the compensation and benefits and other non-interest expense line items on the Consolidated Statement of Operations during the quarter and we expect this investment to increase net income in future periods. For the six months ended March 31, 2018, earnings increased 43% to $2.68 million, or $0.45 per diluted share from $1.87 million, or $0.35 per diluted share for the six months ended March 31, 2017.\nCore earnings (non-GAAP) matched reported GAAP earnings, on a per share basis, as there were no material revenues or expenses for Q2 fiscal 2018 that would affect core earnings. Historically, core earnings (non-GAAP) have excluded merger and branch closure expenditures and the net impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") which are itemized on the accompanying financial table \"Reconciliation of GAAP Earnings (loss) and Core Earnings (non-GAAP)\".\nCore earnings is a non-GAAP measure that management believes enhances investors' ability to better understand the underlying business performance and trends related to core business activities. For a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results, see the accompanying financial table \"Reconciliation of GAAP Earnings (loss) and Core Earnings (non-GAAP)\".\n“Our second fiscal quarter financial results were somewhat below our expectations, as prolonged winter conditions and somewhat higher interest rates impacted our mortgage business. We continue to make progress in growing our commercial loan portfolio and invested in additional commercial bankers to support our organic growth and M&A strategy. Community Banking loans excludes the legacy loan portfolio consisting of indirect paper and one to four family portfolio loans. This together with the planned runoff of our legacy portfolio, have reduced our exposure to these transactional loans from 57% to 42% of total loans from the prior year period. We added four commercial bankers to our team and expect continued loan growth in our core lending portfolio which focuses on C&I, commercial real estate, agricultural and multi-family lending,” said Stephen Bianchi, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our commercial banking platform has been substantially updated over the past two years through technology and personnel, and we remain committed to enhancing the value of our franchise to our shareholders.”\nQ2 Fiscal 2018 Financial Highlights: (at or for the periods ended March 31, 2018, compared to March 31, 2017 and /or December 31, 2017)\nNet income reflected earnings of $1.34 million in Q2 fiscal 2018, compared to $934,000 a year ago, and $1.34 million in Q1 fiscal 2018.\nNet interest margin (NIM) remained stable at 3.40% for the current quarter, compared to 3.42% for Q1 fiscal 2018 and improved 9 basis point from 3.31% a year earlier.\nLoan loss provision was $100,000 in Q2 fiscal 2018 relative to $100,000 the previous quarter as the core loan portfolio continues to expand.\nTotal non-interest income declined to $1.68 million in Q2 fiscal 2018, compared to $1.94 million in Q1 fiscal 2018 and increased from $1.13 million one year earlier. The current quarter reflects lower loan fees and gains on the sale of mortgage loans relative to the prior quarter due in part to seasonally slower mortgage loan activity during the winter months.\nTotal non-interest expense for Q2 fiscal 2018 of $7.10 million compared similarly to Q1 fiscal 2018 at $7.14 million.\nNet loans were $715.2 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $725.1 million at December 31, 2017, reflecting a decline in one-to-four family loans and indirect lending.\nTotal deposits were $748.6 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $741.1 million at December 31, 2017 and $530.9 million at March 31, 2017.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses (“ALLL”) was 0.82% of total loans at March 31, 2018, compared to 0.80% one quarter earlier.\nNonperforming assets (“NPA”) were $14.0 million, or 1.49% of total assets at March 31, 2018, compared to $14.2 million, or 1.50% of total assets at December 31, 2017.\nBank capital ratios exceeded regulatory guidelines for a well-capitalized financial institution under the Basel III regulatory requirements at March 31, 2018:\nCitizens\nCommunity\nFederal N.A. To Be Well Capitalized Under\nPrompt Corrective Action\nProvisions Total capital (to risk weighted assets) 13.2 % 10.0 % Tier 1 capital (to risk weighted assets) 12.4 % 8.0 % Common equity tier 1 capital (to risk weighted assets) 12.4 % 6.5 % Tier 1 leverage ratio (to adjusted total assets) 9.3 % 5.0 % Balance Sheet and Asset Quality Review\nTotal assets were $940.4 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $943.0 million at December 31, 2017, and $668.5 million at March 31, 2017. The increase in total assets from a year ago was primarily due to the acquisition of Wells Financial completed in August 2017.\nLoan balances decreased 1% from the linked quarter due to the reduction of the legacy loans portfolio. At March 31, 2018, commercial, agricultural, multi-family and construction real estate loans totaled 42% of the total loan portfolio, versus 39% for the prior quarter and 31% one year earlier. One-to-four family residential and home equity real estate loans represented 31% of the total loan portfolio versus 32% for the preceding quarter, while consumer related non-real estate loans totaled 16% of the total loan portfolio versus 17% the preceding quarter.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses was largely unchanged at March 31, 2018 and totaled $5.9 million, representing 0.82% of total loans, compared to $5.9 million and 0.80% of total loans at December 31, 2017. Net charged off loans totaled $72,000 for the second quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $183,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nNonperforming assets were $14.0 million, or 1.49% of total assets at March 31, 2018 compared to $14.2 million, or 1.50% of total assets at December 31, 2017. Included in nonperforming assets are approximately $6.3 million of REO properties acquired from the Wells Financial acquisition. The Bank is actively working to resolve non-performing loans as well as selling owned real estate properties.\nDeposits totaled $748.6 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $741.1 million at December 31, 2017, and $530.9 million at March 31, 2017. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased to $79.9 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $78.7 million at December 31, 2017, and $45.7 million at March 31, 2017.\nFederal Home Loan Bank (\"FHLB\") advances decreased to $85.0 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $94.0 million at December 31, 2017. Other borrowings decreased slightly to $29.5 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $29.9 million at December 31, 2017. The Bank has used borrowings and equity capital to fund acquisitions of other financial institutions, branch closings and FHLB advances to support organic loan growth.\nTangible book value per share (non-GAAP) was $9.82 at March 31, 2018, compared to $9.98 at December 31, 2017. The slight decrease in tangible book value per share was due to the payment of dividends, additional unearned deferred compensation and accumulated other comprehensive losses on available for sale securities due to the higher interest rate environment.\nAs noted above, capital ratios for the Bank continued to remain well above regulatory requirements.\nReview of Operations\nNet interest income was $7.4 million for Q2 fiscal 2018, compared to $7.5 million for Q1 fiscal 2018 and $5.2 million one year earlier. For the six months ended March 31, 2018, net interest income was $14.9 million compared to $10.8 million for the six months ended March 31, 2017. The net interest margin (“NIM”) was 3.40% for Q2 fiscal 2018, compared to 3.42% one quarter earlier and 3.31% for the like quarter one year earlier. The increase in the NIM relative to the prior year was supported by higher yields on loans and lower cost of funds.\nLoan yields increased to 4.77% for Q2 fiscal 2018 compared to 4.72% one quarter earlier and 4.57% for Q2 fiscal 2017. Meanwhile, deposit costs increased slightly to 0.76% for Q2 fiscal 2018 from 0.72% one quarter earlier and declined from 0.88% for Q2 fiscal 2017. Costs on the FHLB and other borrowings increased to 2.57% for Q2 fiscal 2018 from 2.33% one quarter earlier and 1.34% for the quarter ended Q2 2017. For the six months ended March 31, 2018, the NIM increased to 3.42% from 3.34% for the six months ended March 31, 2017.\nFor Q2 fiscal 2018, provision for loan losses totaling $100,000 was recorded equal to the provision taken in Q1 fiscal 2018, both of which are responsive to organic loan growth. Net charge offs were down to $72,000 for Q2 fiscal 2018, compared to $183,000 for Q1 fiscal 2018. Allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans was 0.82%, at March 31, 2018, compared to 0.80% at December 31, 2017.\nTotal non-interest income was $1.68 million for Q2 fiscal 2018 compared to $1.94 million for Q1 fiscal 2018 and $1.13 million for Q2 fiscal 2017. The lower level of non-interest income primarily relates to lower gains on the sale of mortgage loans originated and lower loan fees and service charges. The lower level of mortgage origination relates to the seasonality of home sales with fewer sales during the winter months and the slight increase in mortgage lending rates due to the higher interest rate environment. For the six months ended March 31, 2018, non-interest income totaled $3.61 million compared to $2.37 million for the six months ended March 31, 2017.\nTotal non-interest expense was $7.1 million for Q2 fiscal 2018 compared to $7.1 million for Q1 fiscal 2018 and $5.0 million for Q2 fiscal 2017. Total non-interest expense for the second quarter includes increased compensation and benefit expenses and other expenses resulting from the addition of new commercial bankers partially offset by lower professional fees. For the six months ended March 31, 2018, total non-interest expenses totaled $14.2 million compared to $10.4 million for the six months ended March 31, 2017. The higher expenses for the six-month period primarily relate to increased costs associated with the acquisition of Wells Financial Corp.\nProvisions for income taxes were $487,000 for Q2 fiscal 2018 compared to $883,000 for Q1 fiscal 2018 and $459,000 for Q2 fiscal 2017. The effective tax rate for Q2 fiscal 2018 was 26.6% compared to 39.7% one quarter earlier and 33.0% for Q2 fiscal 2017. For the six months ended March 31, 2018, the effective tax rate was 33.8% compared to 33.1% for the six months ended March 31, 2017. The six-month period ended March 31, 2018 was impacted by the revaluation of its net deferred tax assets. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“the Tax Act”), enacted on December 22, 2017, reduces the corporate Federal income tax rate for the Company from 34% to 24.5% in fiscal 2018 and 21% in fiscal 2019. Additionally, the Tax Act made other changes to U.S. corporate income tax laws.\nThese financial results are preliminary until the Form 10-Q is filed in May 2018.\nAbout the Company\nCitizens Community Bancorp, Inc.

Non-GAAP measures eliminate the impact of certain one-time expenses such as acquisition and branch closure costs and related data processing termination fees, legal costs, severance pay, accelerated depreciation expense and lease termination fees and the net impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Merger related charges represent expenses to either satisfy contractual obligations of acquired entities without any useful benefit to the Company or to convert and consolidate customer records onto the Company platforms. These costs are unique to each transaction based on the contracts in existence at the merger date. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in this press release. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other banks and financial institutions.\nContact: Steve Bianchi, CEO\n(715)-836-9994\nCITIZENS COMMUNITY BANCORP, INC.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets (unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nMarch 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 September 30,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 Assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 31,468 $ 47,215 $ 41,677 $ 19,850 Other interest bearing deposits 8,399 7,155 8,148 745 Securities available for sale \"AFS\" 118,314 96,548 95,883 79,369 Securities held to maturity \"HTM\" 5,013 5,227 5,453 5,984 Non-marketable equity securities, at cost 7,707 8,151 7,292 4,412 Loans receivable 721,128 730,918 732,995 534,808 Allowance for loan losses (5,887 ) (5,859 ) (5,942 ) (5,835 ) Loans receivable, net 715,241 725,059 727,053 528,973 Loans held for sale 1,520 2,179 2,334 — Mortgage servicing rights 1,849 1,866 1,886 — Office properties and equipment, net 9,151 8,517 9,645 5,163 Accrued interest receivable 3,251 3,189 3,291 1,982 Intangible assets 5,126 5,287 5,449 791 Goodwill 10,444 10,444 10,444 4,663 Foreclosed and repossessed assets, net 7,080 7,031 6,017 692 Bank owned life insurance 11,502 11,424 11,343 11,307 Other assets 4,318 3,740 4,749 4,522 TOTAL ASSETS $ 940,383 $ 943,032 $ 940,664 $ 668,453 Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity Liabilities: Deposits $ 748,615 $ 741,069 $ 742,504 $ 530,929 Federal Home Loan Bank advances 85,000 94,000 90,000 60,491 Other borrowings 29,479 29,899 30,319 11,000 Other liabilities 3,780 3,610 4,358 1,653 Total liabilities 866,874 868,578 867,181 604,073 Stockholders’ equity: Common stock— $0.01 par value, authorized 30,000,000;
