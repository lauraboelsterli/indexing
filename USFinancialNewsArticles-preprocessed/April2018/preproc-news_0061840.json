    "text": "WYALUSING, Pa., April 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Anthony J. Gabello, President and Chief Executive Officer of Peoples LTD (OTC: PPLL), holding company for PS Bank, has announced results for the first quarter 2018. Consolidated net income year-to-date was $1,687,000, or $2.79 earnings per share, compared to first quarter 2017 net income in the amount of $728,000 or $1.20 per share as adjusted for the 5% stock dividend at year-end 2017.
