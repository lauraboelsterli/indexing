    "text": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Ten people were killed and two were injured when a four-storey hotel collapsed in a crowded part of Indore in Madhya Pradesh late on Saturday, a local police official said.\nRescue operations were complete and no other casualties were likely, assistant sub-inspector Ramesh Kirade told Reuters by telephone.\nWhile the building was old, the reason for its collapse was not immediately known, Kirade said.\nAccording to local news reports, the building collapsed after a heavy vehicle rammed into it.\nBuilding collapses are common in India, where unscrupulous builders and officials often dodge regulations or overlook the need to renovate old structures.\nIn August, a 117-year-old building collapsed in the financial hub of Mumbai killing at least 22 people.\nReporting by Aditi Shah; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan\n ",
