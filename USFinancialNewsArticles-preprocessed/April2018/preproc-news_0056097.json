    "text": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., April 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Healthcare Trust of America, Inc. (NYSE:HTA), the largest dedicated owner and operator of medical office buildings in the United States, announced today that its board of directors issued a quarterly dividend of $0.305 per share of common stock. This represents an annualized rate of $1.22 per share of common stock with an annualized yield of 5.00% based on HTA's closing share price as of April 26, 2018. The dividend will be paid on July 10, 2018 to stockholders of record on July 5, 2018.\nAdditionally, the eligible holders of HTA's operating partnership units (\"OP Units\") will receive an increase in their quarterly OP Unit distributions, which is on par with HTA's common stock dividend described above.\nThe amount of common stock dividends HTA pays to its stockholders is determined by HTA's board of directors, at its discretion, and is dependent on a number of factors, including funds available for the payment of distributions, HTA's financial condition, capital expenditure requirements and annual distribution requirements needed to maintain HTA's status as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code. HTA's board of directors may reduce its dividend rate and HTA cannot guarantee the amount of dividends paid in the future, if any.\nAbout Healthcare Trust of America, Inc.
