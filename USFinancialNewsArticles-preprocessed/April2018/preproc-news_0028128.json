    "text": "April 15, 2018 / 8:48 AM / Updated 2 hours ago West Brom braced for United's firepower, say Foster Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - West Bromwich Albion can expect a difficult test against a Manchester United attack that boasts plenty of pace and power, goalkeeper Ben Foster said ahead of Sunday’s Premier League clash at Old Trafford. Soccer Football - Premier League - West Bromwich Albion vs Swansea City - The Hawthorns, West Bromwich, Britain - April 7, 2018 West Bromwich Albion's Ben Foster during the warm up before the match Action Images via Reuters/Andrew Boyers \nUnited beat West Brom 2-1 in the reverse fixture earlier this season with goals from forwards Romelu Lukaku and Jesse Lingard and Foster said the league’s basement club had to be wary of the threat posed by Jose Mourinho’s side. \n\"We'll go there with our own game plan. We know, obviously, that United have got a lot of talent and a lot of pace and power up front,\" Foster told West Brom's website here \nWest Brom have maintained their top-flight status for the last seven seasons but appear likely to drop to the Championship if they do not pick up wins in their five remaining matches. \nThe club ended a run of eight straight defeats last weekend with a draw against Swansea City under caretaker manager Darren Moore, who stepped in following the sacking of Alan Pardew earlier this month. \n“Darren has been in the job for two weeks now and he has taken to it like a fish to water,” Foster added. \n“He’s massive on working as a team, getting confidence up and getting the lads enjoying their football.” \n“We’ve got to work on our shape when we haven’t got the ball. When we have got the ball we’ve got to express ourselves like Mooro’s big on us doing.” \nWest Brom have 21 points after three wins, 12 draws and 18 defeats. United are second in the standings, 50 points above the West Midlands club. Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; editing by Amlan Chakraborty",
