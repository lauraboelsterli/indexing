    "text": "April 10, 2018 / 11:58 AM / Updated 6 hours ago Kroger to hire 11,000 employees to its supermarkets   Kroger Co ( KR.N ) said on Tuesday it would hire 11,000 employees in its supermarket divisions, including Fred Meyer stores and Mariano’s Fresh Market, with nearly 2,000 of them for management roles. FILE PHOTO: A logo of Kroger is displayed on a monitor above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York, U.S., December 5, 2017. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson \nThe hiring would not include jobs created as a result of capital investment, such as temporary construction jobs or increases due to the company’s mergers, Kroger said. \nThe company's hiring plan follows local media reports that Kroger workers, led by civil rights activist Reverend Jesse Jackson Sr., plan to protest at its Cincinnati headquarters against the alleged closure of several stores that serve minority communities. ( cin.ci/2HnlAJZ ) \nThe company, which had about 449,000 employees as of Feb.3, hired 10,000 employees in 2017 and 12,000 in 2016. \n(This version of the story refiles to correct company name spelling in paragraph 2.)
