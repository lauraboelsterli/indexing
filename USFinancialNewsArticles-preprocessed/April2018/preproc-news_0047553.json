Pope Francis receives a gift from Austrian Police music band at the end of his Wednesday general audience in Saint Peter's square at the Vatican, April 25, 2018. REUTERS/Max Rossi\nThe meeting will take place on July 7 in the southern Adriatic port city of Bari, chosen because it is home to the relics of St. Nicholas, a figure venerated in both the Western and Eastern branches of Christianity.\nNicholas, who lived about 1,700 years ago in what is today Turkey, is particularly honoured by Christian Orthodox Churches in countries such as Syria, Iraq, Egypt and Lebanon in the Middle East.\nNicholas is also widely venerated among Orthodox Christians in Russia, which is Syria’s ally in the civil war.\nThe Vatican said the encounter would be an “ecumenical meeting for peace” where the religious leaders would discuss “the dramatic situation of the Middle East that afflicts so many brothers and sisters in the faith”.
