    "text": "Home / NEWS / Nikkei rises as chip-related stocks surge; Tokyo Electron jumps Nikkei rises as chip-related stocks surge; Tokyo Electron jumps 2 hours ago NEWS , tokyo\nTOKYO, April 26 (Reuters) – Japan’s Nikkei share average rose on Thursday, buoyed by gains in U.S. shares overnight and a sharp jump in index heavyweight Tokyo Electron after it forecast strong profits for this fiscal year.\nThe Nikkei was up 0.5 percent at 22,332.32 points by midmorning.\nSemiconductor equipment maker Tokyo Electron jumped 9.7 percent and was the third most traded stock by turnover after it said it expected a 30 percent rise in its operating profit to 366 billion yen for this fiscal year ending March 2019.\nIt also expects to post a record profit for a third straight year.\nThe stock, which contributed a hefty 71 positive points to the Nikkei, had been battered in the past month following weakness in tech shares globally, so investors found this an opportunity to buy back.\nOther chip-related stocks followed suit. Advantest Corp soared 3.4 percent, silicon maker Sumco Corp surged 4.4 percent and semiconductor equipment maker Screen Holdings advanced 3.9 percent.\nThe broader Topix added 0.2 percent to 1,771.98.",
