Adjusted consolidated net operating income 1 was $57.5 million, or $1.10 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to a loss of $3.9 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017. These results increased primarily from a lower level of catastrophe losses and improved underlying performance in the Property & Casualty division.\n“Our transformation continues as our results indicate we’re increasing the value we deliver to our stakeholders,” said Joseph P. Lacher, Jr., Kemper’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “This quarter was highlighted by sustained growth in our nonstandard auto franchise, where earned premiums grew 23 percent while improving underwriting margins. Our pending acquisition of Infinity Property and Casualty will further increase our scale and improve our ability to provide valuable products at reasonable prices to better serve our combined customer base.”\nThree Months Ended Mar 31, Mar 31, (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) (Unaudited) 2018 2017 Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income (Loss) 1 $ 57.5 $ (3.9 ) Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations 53.6 (0.4 ) Net Income (Loss) 53.8 (0.3 ) Impact of Catastrophe Losses and Related Loss Adjustment Expense (LAE) on Net Income (Loss) $ (6.1 ) $ (42.7 ) Diluted Net Income (Loss) Per Share From: Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income (Loss) 1 $ 1.10 $ (0.08 ) Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations 1.02 (0.01 ) Net Income (Loss) 1.02 (0.01 ) Impact of Catastrophe Losses and Related LAE on Net Income (Loss) Per Share $ (0.12 ) $ (0.83 ) 1 Adjusted consolidated net operating income is an after-tax, non-GAAP financial measure. See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for additional information. Capital\nTotal Shareholders’ Equity at the end of the quarter was $2,063.8 million, a decrease of $51.8 million, or 2 percent, since year-end 2017 driven by the impact of higher market yields on the value of our fixed maturity portfolio, partially offset by net income. Kemper ended the year with cash and investments at the holding company of $184.4 million, and the $225 million revolving credit agreement was undrawn.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Kemper paid dividends of $12.5 million.\nKemper ended the quarter with a book value per share of $40.05, down 3 percent from $41.11 at the end of 2017. Book value per share excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities was $36.35, up 2 percent from $35.57 at the end of 2017, driven by net income, partially offset by dividends paid to shareholders.\nRevenues\nTotal revenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased $41.6 million, or 6 percent, to $693.0 million, compared to the first quarter of 2017, driven by $49.8 million higher nonstandard personal auto earned premiums. Nonstandard personal auto earned premiums increased from both higher policies in force and higher premium rates. Net investment income decreased $2.4 million to $79.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, primarily from $4.3 million lower net investment income on the alternative investments portfolio. Net realized investment gains were $2.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $10.5 million last year.\nThe investment portfolio in total generated a pre-tax equivalent annualized book yield of 5.0 percent for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 5.4 percent in 2017.\nSegment Results\nUnless otherwise noted, (i) the segment results discussed below are presented on an after-tax basis, (ii) prior-year development includes both catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses and LAE, (iii) catastrophe losses and LAE exclude the impact of prior-year development, (iv) underlying loss ratio includes loss and LAE, and (v) all comparisons are made to the prior year quarter unless otherwise stated.\nThree Months Ended Mar 31, Mar 31, (Dollars in Millions) (Unaudited) 2018 2017 Segment Net Operating Income (Loss): Property & Casualty Insurance $ 36.0 $ (22.1 ) Life & Health Insurance 23.8 21.5 Total Segment Net Operating Income (Loss) 59.8 (0.6 ) Corporate and Other Net Operating Income (Loss) (2.3 ) (3.3 ) Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income (Loss) 57.5 (3.9 ) Net Income (Loss) From: Change in Fair Value of Equity Securities 0.6 — Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments 2.1 6.8 Net Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings (0.4 ) (3.3 ) Acquisition Related Transaction and Integration Costs (6.2 ) — Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations $ 53.6 $ (0.4 ) The Property & Casualty Insurance segment reported net operating income of $36.0 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to a loss of $22.1 million in 2017. Results increased primarily from lower catastrophe losses, a favorable change in loss and LAE reserve development and strong nonstandard personal auto growth and profitability. Catastrophe losses were $6.1 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $42.7 million last year.\nThe Property & Casualty Insurance segment’s underlying combined ratio improved 2.7 percentage points to 94.1 percent in the first quarter of 2018. The underlying loss ratio improved 1.9 percentage points to 71.8 percent, primarily from improvement in nonstandard personal auto and preferred personal auto partially offset by the performance of homeowners. Nonstandard auto improved 5.3 percentage points to 76.2 percent in the quarter, as average earned premium outpaced loss cost trends. Preferred personal auto’s underlying loss ratio improved 3.6 percentage points to 70.1 percent, driven by improved frequency and higher average earned premium slightly offset by higher severity. The homeowners underlying loss ratio increased 6.1 percentage points to 57.0 percent. About a third of the increase was related to the cost of our aggregate catastrophe program which will help reduce the volatility of our earnings.\nThe Property & Casualty Insurance segment’s expense ratio improved 0.8 percentage points as an even larger percentage of earned premiums were generated by the nonstandard auto business, which grew at 23 percent and runs at a lower expense ratio. The larger premium base in general and continued execution on cost initiatives also contributed to the improvement.\nThe Life & Health Insurance segment reported net operating income of $23.8 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $21.5 million in 2017, primarily due to the impact of tax code changes and growth in supplemental A&H business. These gains were partially offset by higher policyholders’ benefits in both supplemental A&H and Life products.\nThe Corporate & Other net operating loss decreased $1.0 million, primarily from lower interest expense due to a lower level of outstanding debt.\nUnaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 are presented below.\nThree

Expense (6.1 ) (11.1 ) Segment Net Operating Income $ 23.8 $ 21.5 Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income (Loss)\nAdjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income (Loss) is an after-tax, non-GAAP financial measure computed by excluding from Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations the after-tax impact of 1) income (loss) from change in fair value of equity securities, 2) net realized gains on sales of investments, 3) net impairment losses recognized in earnings related to investments, 4) acquisition related transaction and integration costs, 5) loss from early extinguishment of debt and 6) significant non-recurring or infrequent items that may not be indicative of ongoing operations. Significant non-recurring items are excluded when (a) the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably unlikely to recur within two years and (b) there has been no similar charge or gain within the prior two years. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations.\nKemper believes that Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income (Loss) provides investors with a valuable measure of its ongoing performance because it reveals underlying operational performance trends that otherwise might be less apparent if the items were not excluded. Income (Loss) from Change in Fair Value of Equity Securities, Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments and Net Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings related to investments included in the Company’s results may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by business decisions and external economic developments such as capital market conditions that impact the values of the Company’s investments, the timing of which is unrelated to the insurance underwriting process. Loss from Early Extinguishment of Debt is driven by the Company’s financing and refinancing decisions and capital needs, as well as external economic developments such as debt market conditions, the timing of which is unrelated to the insurance underwriting process. Acquisition Related Transaction and Integration Costs may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by the timing of acquisitions and business decisions which are unrelated to the insurance underwriting process. Significant non-recurring items are excluded because, by their nature, they are not indicative of the Company’s business or economic trends.\nA reconciliation of Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income (Loss) to Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is presented below.\nThree Months Ended Mar 31, Mar 31, (Dollars in Millions) (Unaudited) 2018 2017 Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income (Loss) $ 57.5 $ (3.9 ) Net Income (Loss) From: Income from Change in Fair Value of Equity Securities 0.6 — Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments 2.1 6.8 Net Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings (0.4 ) (3.3 ) Acquisition Related Transaction and Integration Costs (6.2 ) — Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations $ 53.6 $ (0.4 ) Diluted Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income (Loss) Per Unrestricted Share\nDiluted Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income (Loss) Per Unrestricted Share is a non-GAAP financial measure computed by dividing Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income (Loss) attributed to unrestricted shares by the weighted-average unrestricted shares and equivalent shares outstanding. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is Diluted Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Per Unrestricted Share.\nA reconciliation of Diluted Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income (Loss) Per Unrestricted Share to Diluted Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Per Unrestricted Share for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is presented below.\nThree Months Ended Mar 31, Mar 31, (Unaudited) 2018 2017 Diluted Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income (Loss) Per Unrestricted Share $ 1.10 $ (0.08 ) Net Income (Loss) Per Unrestricted Share From: Income from Change in Fair Value of Equity Securities 0.01 — Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments 0.04 0.13 Net Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings (0.01 ) (0.06 ) Acquisition Related Transaction and Integration Costs (0.12 ) — Diluted Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Per Unrestricted Share $ 1.02 $ (0.01 ) Book Value Per Share Excluding Net Unrealized Gains on Fixed Maturities\nBook Value Per Share Excluding Net Unrealized Gains on Fixed Maturities is a ratio that uses a non-GAAP financial measure. It is calculated by dividing shareholders’ equity after excluding the after-tax impact of net unrealized gains on fixed income securities by total Common Shares Issued and Outstanding. Book Value Per Share is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Kemper uses the trends in book value per share, excluding the after-tax impact of net unrealized gains on fixed income securities, in conjunction with book value per share to identify and analyze the change in net worth attributable to management efforts between periods. Kemper believes the non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period and are generally driven by economic developments, primarily capital market conditions, the magnitude and timing of which are not influenced by management. Kemper believes it enhances understanding and comparability of performance by highlighting underlying business activity and profitability drivers.\nA reconciliation of the numerator used in the computation of Book Value Per Share Excluding Net Unrealized Gains on Fixed Maturities and Book Value Per Share at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 is presented below.\nMar 31, Dec 31, (Dollars in Millions) (Unaudited) 2018 2017 Shareholders’ Equity Excluding Net Unrealized Gains on Fixed Maturities $ 1,873.3 $ 1,830.4 Net Unrealized Gains on Fixed Maturities 190.5 285.2 Shareholders’ Equity $ 2,063.8 $ 2,115.6 Underlying Combined Ratio\nUnderlying Combined Ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure that is computed by adding the current year non-catastrophe losses and LAE ratio with the insurance expense ratio. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is the combined ratio, which is computed by adding total incurred losses and LAE, including the impact of catastrophe losses and loss and LAE reserve development from prior years, with the insurance expense ratio. Kemper believes the underlying combined ratio is useful to investors and is used by management to reveal the trends in Kemper’s property and casualty insurance businesses that may be obscured by catastrophe losses and prior-year reserve development. These catastrophe losses may cause loss trends to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude, and can have a significant impact on incurred losses and LAE and the combined ratio. Prior-year reserve development is caused by unexpected loss development on historical reserves. Because reserve development relates to the re-estimation of losses from earlier periods, it has no bearing on the performance of the company’s insurance products in the current period. Kemper believes it is useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing its underwriting performance. The underlying combined ratio should not be considered a substitute for the combined ratio and does not reflect the overall underwriting profitability of our business.\nConference Call\nKemper will discuss its first quarter 2018 results in a conference call on Monday, April 30, at 4:15 p.m. Eastern (3:15 p.m. Central) Time.
