(NYSE: ROK) today reported fiscal 2018 second quarter sales of $1,651.2 million, up 6.2 percent from $1,554.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Organic sales grew 3.5 percent. Currency translation increased sales by 3.9 percentage points, and the prior year divestiture reduced sales by 1.2 percentage points.\nFiscal 2018 second quarter net income was $227.4 million or $1.77 per share, compared to net income of $189.5 million or $1.45 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2018 second quarter Adjusted EPS was $1.89, up 22 percent compared to $1.55 in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The increases in EPS and Adjusted EPS were primarily due to higher sales.\nPre-tax margin was 18.1 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 14.8 percent in the same period last year. Total segment operating margin was 20.9 percent compared to 19.0 percent a year ago. The increases in pre-tax margin and total segment operating margin were primarily due to higher sales. Total segment operating earnings were $345.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, up 17 percent from $296.0 million in the same period of fiscal 2017.\nCommenting on the results, Blake D. Moret, chairman and chief executive officer, said, \"Demand for the quarter was fairly broad based across regions and verticals, enabling us to achieve organic sales growth of 3.5 percent, as we expected. Growth was led by heavy industries, including oil and gas, mining, metals, and semiconductor. Results were also strong in Information Solutions and Connected Services, which represent new value from the Connected Enterprise, and again grew double digits. I am also pleased with our 22 percent Adjusted EPS growth in the quarter and our very strong free cash flow performance, which positions us well for key growth investments and continued capital returns in 2018.\"\nOutlook\nThe following table provides updated guidance as it relates to sales growth and earnings per share for fiscal 2018:\nSales Growth Guidance EPS Guidance Reported sales growth 4.5% to 7.5% Diluted EPS $3.65 - $3.95 Organic sales growth 3.5% to 6.5% Adjusted EPS $7.70 - $8.00 Currency translation ~ 2% Divestiture ~ (1)% Commenting on the outlook, Moret added, \"The global manufacturing environment remains favorable and macroeconomic indicators are positive. Taking our strong first half results and the macro outlook into consideration, we still expect fiscal 2018 organic sales growth to be in the range of 3.5 percent to 6.5 percent and project fiscal 2018 reported sales of approximately $6.7 billion at the midpoint. We are increasing our Adjusted EPS guidance range to $7.70 - $8.00.\"\nMoret continued, \"We are ramping up investments to accelerate profitable growth and increase long-term differentiation. These include software development and commercial resources to fuel the growth of our Information Solutions and Connected Services offerings, accelerated investments to expand our Process capabilities, and projects to enhance employee engagement globally. We remain committed to investments that enable us to help our customers meet their productivity objectives and drive profitable growth and superior returns for our shareowners.\n“Consistent with our long track record of returning excess cash to shareowners, today we are announcing a ten percent dividend increase. This increase reflects our confidence in the Connected Enterprise strategy and our ability to deliver sustainable cash generation.\n“The dedication of our employees, partners, and suppliers continues to make the difference at our customers and is the key to our success.”\nFollowing is a discussion of fiscal 2018 second quarter results for both segments.\nArchitecture & Software\nArchitecture & Software quarterly sales were $768.4 million, an increase of 6.9 percent compared to $719.0 million in the same period last year. Organic sales increased 2.5 percent, and currency translation increased sales by 4.4 percentage points. Segment operating earnings were $218.2 million compared to $190.6 million in the same period last year. Segment operating margin increased to 28.4 percent from 26.5 percent a year ago.\nControl Products & Solutions\nControl Products & Solutions quarterly sales were $882.8 million, an increase of 5.7 percent compared to $835.3 million in the same period last year. Organic sales increased 4.4 percent, currency translation increased sales by 3.6 percentage points, and the prior year divestiture reduced sales by 2.3 percentage points. Segment operating earnings were $126.9 million compared to $105.4 million in the same period last year. Segment operating margin increased to 14.4 percent from 12.6 percent a year ago.\nOther Information\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2018, cash flow provided by operating activities was $381.4 million and free cash flow was $359.3 million. Return on invested capital was 43.6 percent.\nFiscal 2018 second quarter general corporate-net expense was $17.8 million compared to $21.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nOn a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was 24.1 percent compared to 17.7 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The higher effective tax rate was due to lower favorable discrete tax items in the current quarter compared to the prior year and an additional provisional charge related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\"), partially offset by the lower tax rate under the Tax Act. The Adjusted Effective Tax Rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was 20.5 percent compared to 19.2 percent a year ago. The increase in the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate was primarily due to lower favorable discrete tax items in the current quarter compared to the prior year, partially offset by the lower tax rate under the Tax Act. For fiscal 2018, the Company now expects an effective tax rate of approximately 60.5 percent and an Adjusted Effective Tax Rate of approximately 20.5 percent.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company repurchased 2.5 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $465.0 million. At March 31, 2018, $934.8 million remained available under the January 15, 2018 share repurchase authorization.\nToday the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 92 cents per share on the Company's common stock, payable on June 11, 2018 to shareowners of record at the close of business on May 14, 2018.\nOrganic sales, total segment operating earnings, total segment operating margin, Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, free cash flow, and return on invested capital are non-GAAP measures that are reconciled to GAAP measures in the attachments to this release.\nConference Call\nA conference call to discuss our financial results will take place at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 25, 2018.

We exclude purchase accounting depreciation and amortization, general corporate – net, non-operating pension costs, costs related to the unsolicited Emerson proposals, interest expense and income tax provision because we do not consider these costs to be directly related to the operating performance of our segments. We believe that these measures are useful to investors as measures of operating performance. We use these measures to monitor and evaluate the profitability of our Company. Our measures of total segment operating earnings and total segment operating margin may be different from those used by other companies.\n2 Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP earnings measure that excludes the non-operating pension costs and their related income tax effects, costs related to the unsolicited Emerson proposals in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and their related tax effects, and the provisional tax effects of deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and the revaluation of net deferred tax assets due to the enactment of the Tax Act. See \"Other Supplemental Information - Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate\" section for more information regarding non-operating pension costs and a reconciliation to GAAP measures.

We believe this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from our activities without the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and/or acquisitions. We use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and operating segment performance. We determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period’s sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year. When we acquire businesses, we exclude sales in the current period for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period. When we divest a business, we exclude sales in the prior period for which there are no comparable sales in the current period. Organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year, excluding divestitures. We attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination.\nThe following is a reconciliation of reported sales to organic sales for the three and six 2018 compared to sales for the three and six 2017:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Sales Excluding Effect of Effect of Sales Changes in Changes in Effect of Organic Effect of Excluding Sales Currency Currency Acquisitions Sales Sales Divestitures Divestitures United States $ 888.0 $ (0.6 ) $ 887.4 $ — $ 887.4 $ 868.7 $ (12.1 ) $ 856.6 Canada 85.8 (3.8 ) 82.0 — 82.0 85.0 (4.9 ) 80.1 EMEA 340.6 (42.8 ) 297.8 — 297.8 301.0 — 301.0 Asia Pacific 218.9 (12.1 ) 206.8 — 206.8 198.5 — 198.5 Latin America 117.9 (2.5 ) 115.4 — 115.4 101.1 (1.8 ) 99.3 Total $ 1,651.2 $ (61.8 ) $ 1,589.4 $ — $ 1,589.4 $ 1,554.3 $ (18.8 ) $ 1,535.5 Six Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Sales Excluding Effect of Effect of Sales Changes in Changes in Effect of Organic Effect of Excluding Sales Currency Currency Acquisitions Sales Sales Divestitures Divestitures United States $ 1,739.9 $ (1.3 ) $ 1,738.6 $ — $ 1,738.6 $ 1,688.8 $ (24.4 ) $ 1,664.4 Canada 177.8 (8.2 ) 169.6 — 169.6 167.7 (9.0 ) 158.7 EMEA 648.0 (66.2 ) 581.8 — 581.8 571.7 — 571.7 Asia Pacific 433.4 (17.9 ) 415.5 — 415.5 404.1 — 404.1 Latin America 238.7 (4.6 ) 234.1 — 234.1 212.3 (3.6 ) 208.7 Total $ 3,237.8 $ (98.2 ) $ 3,139.6 $ — $ 3,139.6 $ 3,044.6 $ (37.0 ) $ 3,007.6 The following is a reconciliation of reported sales to organic sales for our operating segments for the three and six 2018 compared to sales for the three and six 2017:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Sales Excluding Effect of Effect of Sales Changes in Changes in Effect of Organic Effect of Excluding Sales Currency Currency Acquisitions Sales Sales Divestitures Divestitures Architecture & Software $ 768.4 $ (31.6 ) $ 736.8 $ — $ 736.8 $ 719.0 $ — $ 719.0 Control Products & Solutions 882.8 (30.2 ) 852.6 — 852.6 835.3 (18.8 ) 816.5 Total $ 1,651.2 $ (61.8 ) $ 1,589.4 $ — $ 1,589.4 $ 1,554.3 $ (18.8 ) $ 1,535.5 Six Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Sales Excluding Effect of Effect of Sales Changes in Changes in Effect of Organic Effect of Excluding Sales Currency Currency Acquisitions Sales Sales Divestitures Divestitures Architecture & Software $ 1,515.3 $ (49.8 ) $ 1,465.5 $ — $ 1,465.5 $ 1,415.4 $ — $ 1,415.4 Control Products & Solutions 1,722.5 (48.4 ) 1,674.1 — 1,674.1 1,629.2 (37.0 ) 1,592.2 Total $ 3,237.8 $ (98.2 ) $ 3,139.6 $ — $ 3,139.6 $ 3,044.6 $ (37.0 ) $ 3,007.6 ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC.\nOTHER SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\n(in millions, except per share amounts and percentages)\nAdjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate\nOur press release contains financial information and earnings guidance regarding Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, which are non-GAAP earnings measures that exclude non-operating pension costs and their related income tax effects, costs related to the unsolicited Emerson proposals in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and their related tax effects, and the provisional tax effects of deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and the revaluation of net deferred tax assets due to the enactment of the Tax Act. We define non-operating pension costs as defined benefit plan interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses and the impact of any plan curtailments or settlements. These components of net periodic benefit cost primarily relate to changes in pension assets and liabilities that are a result of market performance; we consider these and other excluded costs to be unrelated to the operating performance of our business. We believe that Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate provide useful information to our investors about our operating performance and allow management and investors to compare our operating performance period over period. Adjusted EPS is also used as a financial measure of performance for our annual incentive compensation. Our measures of Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate may be different from measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for income from continuing operations, diluted EPS and effective tax rate.\nThe following are the components of operating and non-operating pension costs for the three and six 2018 and 2017:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, Six Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Service cost $ 22.4 $ 24.2 $ 44.6 $ 48.3 Amortization of prior service cost (credit) 0.1 (1.1 ) 0.3 (1.9 ) Operating pension costs 22.5 23.1 44.9 46.4 Interest cost 39.0 37.8 77.8 75.6 Expected return on plan assets (61.5 ) (56.2 ) (122.7 ) (112.4 ) Amortization of net actuarial loss 28.4 38.2 56.7 76.2 Settlements — — — 0.2 Non-operating pension costs 5.9 19.8 11.8 39.6 Net periodic pension cost $ 28.4 $ 42.9 $ 56.7 $ 86.0 The following are reconciliations of income from continuing operations, diluted EPS from continuing operations, and effective tax rate to Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, Six Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Income (loss) from continuing operations $ 227.4 $ 189.5 $ (9.0 ) $ 404.2 Non-operating pension costs 5.9 19.8 11.8 39.6 Tax effect of non-operating pension costs (1.9 ) (7.3 ) (3.7 ) (14.5 ) Costs related to unsolicited Emerson proposals — — 11.2 — Tax effect of costs related to unsolicited Emerson proposals — — (3.1 ) — Effect of deemed repatriation of foreign earnings due to the Tax Act 1 11.5 — 397.0 — Effect of net deferred tax asset revaluation due to the Tax Act 1 — — 94.2 — Adjusted Income $ 242.9 $ 202.0 $ 498.4 $ 429.3 Diluted EPS from continuing operations $ 1.77 $ 1.45 $ (0.07 ) $ 3.11 Non-operating pension costs 0.04 0.15 0.08 0.30 Tax effect of non-operating pension costs (0.01 ) (0.05 ) (0.03 ) (0.11 ) Costs related to unsolicited Emerson proposals — — 0.09 — Tax effect of costs related to unsolicited Emerson proposals — — (0.02 ) — Effect of deemed repatriation of foreign earnings due to the Tax Act 1 0.09 — 3.07 — Effect of net deferred tax asset revaluation due to the Tax Act 1 — — 0.73 — Adjusted EPS $ 1.89 $ 1.55 $ 3.85 $ 3.30 Effective tax rate 24.1 % 17.7 % 101.5 % 17.2 % Tax effect of non-operating pension costs 0.2 % 1.5 % 0.3 % 1.4 % Tax effect of costs related to unsolicited Emerson proposals — % — % 0.1 % — % Effect of deemed repatriation of foreign earnings due to the Tax Act 1 (3.8 )% — % (66.4 )% — % Effect of net deferred tax asset revaluation due to the Tax Act 1 — % — % (15.8 )% — % Adjusted Effective Tax Rate 20.5 % 19.2 % 19.7 % 18.6 % 1 These amounts, which are based on reasonable estimates, will require further adjustments as additional guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury is provided, the Company’s assumptions change, or as further information and interpretations become available.\nFiscal 2018\nGuidance\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2017\nDiluted EPS from continuing operations $3.65 - $3.95 $ 6.35 Non-operating pension costs 0.19 0.64 Tax effect of non-operating pension costs (0.06) (0.23 ) Costs related to unsolicited Emerson proposals 0.09 — Tax effect of costs related to unsolicited Emerson proposals (0.02) — Effect of deemed repatriation of foreign earnings due to the Tax Act 1 3.12 — Effect of net deferred tax asset revaluation due to the Tax Act 1 0.73 — Adjusted EPS $7.70 - $8.00 $ 6.76 Effective tax rate ~ 60.5% 20.4% Tax effect of non-operating pension costs ~ —% 1.1% Tax effect of costs related to unsolicited Emerson proposals ~ —% —% Effect of deemed repatriation of foreign earnings due to the Tax Act 1 ~ (32)% —% Effect of net deferred tax asset revaluation due to the Tax Act 1 ~ (8)% —% Adjusted Effective Tax Rate ~ 20.5% 21.5% 1 These amounts, which are based on reasonable estimates, will require further adjustments as additional guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury is provided, the Company’s assumptions change, or as further information and interpretations become available.\nROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC.\nOTHER SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\n(in millions, except percentages)\nFree Cash Flow\nOur definition of free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy. In our opinion, free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. We use free cash flow, as defined, as one measure to monitor and evaluate our performance, including as a financial measure for our annual incentive compensation. Our definition of free cash flow may be different from definitions used by other companies.\nThe following table summarizes free cash flow by quarter:\nQuarter Ended Dec. 31,\n2016 Mar. 31,\n2017 Jun. 30,\n2017 Sep. 30,\n2017 1 Dec. 31,\n2017 Mar. 31,\n2018 Cash provided by continuing operating activities $ 310.8 $ 301.0 $ 315.3 $ 106.9 $ 212.7 $ 381.4 Capital expenditures (39.4 ) (28.0 ) (30.1 ) (44.2 ) (34.1 ) (22.1 ) Free cash flow $ 271.4 $ 273.0 $ 285.2 $ 62.7 $ 178.6 $ 359.3 1 Free cash flow for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 includes a discretionary pre-tax contribution of $200 million to the Company's U.S. pension trust.\nReturn On Invested Capital\nOur press release contains information regarding Return On Invested Capital (ROIC), which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that ROIC is useful to investors as a measure of performance and of the effectiveness of the use of capital in our operations. We use ROIC as one measure to monitor and evaluate our performance, including as a financial measure for our annual incentive compensation. Our measure of ROIC may be different from that used by other companies. We define ROIC as the percentage resulting from the following calculation:\n(a) Income from continuing operations, before interest expense, income tax provision, and purchase accounting depreciation and amortization, for the most recent twelve months; divided by\n(b) average invested capital for the year, calculated as a five quarter rolling average using the sum of short-term debt, long-term debt, shareowners’ equity, and accumulated amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets, minus cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments; multiplied by\n(c) one minus the effective tax rate for the twelve-month period.\nROIC is calculated and reconciled to GAAP measures as follows:\nTwelve Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (a) Return Income from continuing operations $ 412.5 $ 780.4 Interest expense 75.9 73.9 Income tax provision 734.4 196.7 Purchase accounting depreciation and amortization 19.1 20.4 Return 1,241.9 1,071.4 (b) Average invested capital Short-term debt 594.1 472.4 Long-term debt 1,239.3 1,406.4 Shareowners’ equity 2,228.6 2,114.9 Accumulated amortization of goodwill and intangibles 853.1 820.4 Cash and cash equivalents (1,476.4 ) (1,493.5 ) Short-term and long-term investments (1,193.7 ) (966.4 ) Average invested capital 2,245.0 2,354.2 (c) Effective tax rate Income tax provision 1 243.2 196.7 Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,146.9 $ 977.1 Effective tax rate 21.2 % 20.1 % (a) / (b) * (1-c) Return On Invested Capital 43.6 % 36.4 % 1 The income tax provision used to calculate the effective tax rate is adjusted to remove the provisional effects of the $397.0 million tax on deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and the $94.2 million revaluation of net deferred tax assets due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 in the first two quarters of fiscal 2018.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180425005372/en/\nRockwell Automation\nKeith Lester\nMedia Relations\n414.382.4871\nor\nRockwell Automation\nSteve Etzel\nInvestor Relations\n414.382.8510\nSource: Rockwell Automation, Inc.",
