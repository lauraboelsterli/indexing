    "text": "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M., April 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nPNM Resources (In millions, except EPS)\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\nGAAP net earnings attributable to PNM Resources\n$15.0\n$22.9\nGAAP diluted EPS\n$0.19\n$0.29\nOngoing net earnings\n$16.5\n$22.1\nOngoing diluted EPS\n$0.21\n$0.28\nPNM Resources (NYSE: PNM) today released the company's 2018 first quarter results. In addition, management affirmed its consolidated ongoing earnings guidance of $1.82 to $1.92 per diluted share for 2018 and $2.04 to $2.16 per diluted share for 2019.\n\"The first quarter provided the anticipated financial results that incorporate the phase-in of retail rates at PNM,\" said Pat Vincent-Collawn, PNM Resources' chairman, president and CEO. \"We are focused on achieving our plans for 2018, including the filing of a general rate case in Texas.\"\nSEGMENT REPORTING OF 2018 FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS\nPNM – a vertically integrated electric utility in New Mexico with distribution, transmission and generation assets.\nPNM (In millions, except EPS)\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\nGAAP net earnings attributable to PNM Resources\n$7.7\n$16.5\nGAAP diluted EPS\n$0.10\n$0.21\nOngoing net earnings\n$9.1\n$15.6\nOngoing diluted EPS\n$0.12\n$0.20\nIn the first quarter of 2018, PNM's GAAP and ongoing earnings reflect the retail generation portfolio changes approved in the BART settlement and lower tax expense as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), both of which were incorporated into the revised retail rates phased-in beginning February 2018. Earnings were also impacted in the first quarter of 2018 by increased planned outage costs at the Four Corners Power Plant resulting from the installation of SCR equipment, depreciation and property tax expenses from new capital investments and lower decommissioning and reclamation trust gains. These reductions were partially offset by increased usage from temperatures that were closer to normal than during the first quarter of 2017, and new third-party transmission contracts.\nTNMP – an electric transmission and distribution utility in Texas.\nTNMP (In millions, except EPS)\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\nGAAP net earnings attributable to PNM Resources\n$9.4\n$7.6\nGAAP diluted EPS\n$0.12\n$0.09\nOngoing net earnings\n$9.4\n$7.6\nOngoing diluted EPS\n$0.12\n$0.09\nTNMP's GAAP and ongoing earnings were higher in the first quarter of 2018 due to increased transmission rate relief, higher load and colder temperatures. Earnings also increased due to lower income tax expense associated with the TCJA for the first twenty-five days of January prior to the Public Utility Commission of Texas order requiring deferral of these savings. This was partially offset by increased depreciation and property tax expenses resulting from additional capital investments.\nCorporate and Other – a segment that reflects the PNM Resources holding company and other subsidiaries.\nCorporate and Other (In millions, except EPS)\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\nGAAP net earnings (loss) attributable to PNM Resources\n$(2.1)\n$(1.3)\nGAAP diluted EPS\n$(0.03)\n$(0.01)\nOngoing net earnings (loss)\n$(2.0)\n$(1.2)\nOngoing diluted EPS\n$(0.03)\n$(0.01)\nCorporate and Other's GAAP and ongoing earnings were lower in the first quarter of 2018 due to higher interest rates and the issuance of $300.0 million of senior unsecured notes at 3.25% in March 2018 to reduce variable rate debt exposure.\nFinancial materials are available at http://www.pnmresources.com/investors/results.cfm .\nFIRST QUARTER CONFERENCE CALL: 11 A.M.

Readers are cautioned that all forward-looking statements are based upon current expectations and estimates. PNMR, PNM, and TNMP assume no obligation to update this information. Because actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements, PNMR, PNM, and TNMP caution readers not to place undue reliance on these statements. PNMR's, PNM's, and TNMP's business, financial condition, cash flow, and operating results are influenced by many factors, which are often beyond their control, that can cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. For a discussion of risk factors and other important factors affecting forward-looking statements, please see the Company's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which factors are specifically incorporated by reference herein.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nGAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. Ongoing earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of net unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on economic hedges, the net change in unrealized gains and losses on investment securities, pension expense related to previously disposed of gas distribution business, and certain non-recurring, infrequent, and other items that are not indicative of fundamental changes in the earnings capacity of the Company's operations. The Company uses ongoing earnings and ongoing earnings per diluted share (or ongoing diluted earnings per share) to evaluate the operations of the Company and to establish goals, including those used for certain aspects of incentive compensation, for management and employees. While the Company believes these financial measures are appropriate and useful for investors, they are not measures presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company does not intend for these measures, or any piece of these measures, to represent any financial measure as defined by GAAP. Furthermore, the Company's calculations of these measures as presented may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company uses ongoing earnings guidance to provide investors with management's expectations of ongoing financial performance over the period presented. While the Company believes ongoing earnings guidance is an appropriate measure, it is not a measure presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company does not intend for ongoing earnings guidance to represent an expectation of net earnings as defined by GAAP. Since the future differences between GAAP and ongoing earnings are frequently outside the control of the Company, management is generally not able to estimate the impact of the reconciling items between forecasted GAAP net earnings and ongoing earnings guidance, nor their probable impact on GAAP net earnings without unreasonable effort, therefore, management is generally not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for ongoing earnings guidance. Reconciliations between GAAP and ongoing earnings are contained in schedules 1-2.\nPNM Resources, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nSchedule 1\nReconciliation of GAAP to Ongoing Earnings\n(Preliminary and
