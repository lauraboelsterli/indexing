    "text": "310 COMMENTS President Donald Trump is caught between two powerful business constituents of the Republican Party as he faces growing pressure to resolve a dispute between the oil industry and the Farm Belt.\nOil refineries want out of a costly requirement to blend ethanol into the gasoline they produce. Corn growers say the requirement diversifies the U.S. fuel supply, and insist Mr. Trump fulfill promises to at least hold the ethanol mandate. Both sides have close ties to the GOP and the White House.\nTensions between the two industries have been building since well before Mr. Trump became president, the result of a 2005 law that requires refineries to blend about 10% plant-based ethanol into the fuel they produce, or buy credits from rivals to cover their blending obligations. Congress created the mandate in hopes of reducing carbon emissions and weaning the U.S. from foreign crude at a time when oil prices had begun soaring.\nBy the time Mr. Trump took office, though, oil and gas supplies had gone from shortage to saturation thanks to the shale-drilling boom. Now, oil refiners—and some Trump advisers—consider a rollback of the 2005 regulation years overdue.\nThat leaves Mr. Trump stuck between conflicting promises to cut government regulation and to support ethanol mandates. He was one of the few in the Republican presidential primary race to emphasize the mandate in Iowa—the nation’s biggest corn-producing state and home to the first nominating contests.\nThe Trump White House has failed to broker a deal, even after hosting supporters from both sides in the Oval Office. The administration has struggled for months after several proposals for administrative solutions have run into opposition from corn or oil backers.\n“I can’t see any obvious middle ground,” said Sandy Fielden, director of oil and products research at Morningstar. “If there was an easy answer, we’d all be looking at it.”\nThe impasse has refineries taking matters into their own hands, appealing directly to the Environmental Protection Agency for relief in the form of waivers. The agency has stepped up waiver approvals. That has infuriated agricultural interests and put more pressure on the White House to come up with a permanent solution.\nThe agricultural lobby has been uncomfortable with EPA chief Scott Pruitt, who, before coming to Washington, had called the ethanol mandate “unworkable” and filed a legal brief in 2013 backing a lawsuit challenging it when he was Oklahoma attorney general. Mr. Pruitt landed the EPA role in part because of a recommendation from Carl Icahn , a billionaire adviser to Mr. Trump’s transition team and an owner of a small refinery operator that faces around $250 million in costs to comply with the ethanol mandate.\nMore oil refiners are looking to take advantage of a loophole in the law that has only widened since Mr. Pruitt took over the agency. Small refineries with less than 75,000 barrels a day of capacity—even if owned by a large company—can get a waiver if they prove the mandates are causing “disproportionate economic hardship,” according to the EPA website.\nTo get a waiver, each refinery gets evaluated on its own finances—independent from the health of its parent company. Compliance costs could still be tens of millions of dollars, which alone appears to be enough now to prove economic harm, industry lobbyists said.\nFor years, the EPA regularly rejected requests from refiners seeking waivers from ethanol requirements. Then this March, the agency agreed to waive millions in obligations for Philadelphia Energy Solutions, a major East Coast refiner that filed for bankruptcy after its costs to comply with the program rose to $231 million in 2016. The EPA then began granting a number of waivers to the small refineries able to demonstrate economic harm, including one owned by Andeavor Corp. , one of the country’s largest independent refiners and a company big enough to be part of the S&P 500.\nThe agency has rejected just one of about 30 applicants so far this year, encouraging more refiners to consider applying for the first time. It has received applications from oil giants Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp.\nMany now see an EPA waiver as a given. Some are even asking for waivers that would allow them recoup costs from years past. “If you can show economic harm—which is pretty easy to do—you have to consider it,” according to one oil-industry lobbyist who has been pushing the Trump administration for a waiver for a client. “People never imagined they would be eligible.”\nOne factor behind the change at EPA is a federal appeals-court decision last year that found the agency had been too restrictive in doling out waivers. Mr. Pruitt has since decided to accept every recommendation on a waiver from the Energy Department—which is responsible for calculations evaluating a refinery’s claim of economic harm—and grant full waivers even when the Energy Department recommended only partial waivers. This is opening the floodgates for applications and approvals, analysts and refiners say.\n“The criteria used to grant waivers has not changed since previous administrations,” EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman said. “EPA follows a longstanding, established process.”\nMany in both the refining and farming industries dispute that assertion, and see a significant change in EPA policy. There are 38 plants across the U.S. that could qualify for the exemptions, according to the agency. Based on their capacity, the number of qualifying refineries could make up as much as 10% of the nation’s fuel supply, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis. More than half have already received them.\nOne result of the increase in waivers is a falling price for credits that many refineries need to buy to cover their obligations for ethanol blending. The cost of credits has halved in recent months as traders and companies have grown increasingly confident that the Trump administration will take action to reduce the burden oil refiners face in complying with the law.\nSen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, in a call with reporters Tuesday accused the EPA of abusing the waivers to cap the price of ethanol credits. EPA officials deny undermining the ethanol program.\nWhile Mr. Trump has received support from Mr. Icahn and frequently touts his own backing of the fossil-fuel business, he has to be mindful of Iowa’s political clout and Mr. Grassley’s in particular. Aside from Iowa’s early primary, Mr. Grassley runs the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee, which oversees the confirmation of judges and has launched investigations into matters related to the president’s campaign and businesses.\n“The president has said to me both publicly and privately many times that he intends, and he is keeping his commitment to ethanol,” Mr. Grassley said Tuesday. Mr. Pruitt is “undercutting the president’s promises.”",
