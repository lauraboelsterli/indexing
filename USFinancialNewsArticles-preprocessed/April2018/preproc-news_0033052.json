    "text": "(Corrects to say that Fast Retailing rallied 1.9 percent, in the 4th paragraph)\nTOKYO, April 18 (Reuters) - Japanâ€™s Nikkei share average raced to a seven-week high on Wednesday morning as risk sentiment recovered after Wall Street rose overnight on earnings hopes, lifting shares across the board.\nAlso helping the mood was easing political tensions on the Korean peninsula after a senior U.S. official said CIA Director Mike Pompeo made a secret visit to North Korea over the Easter weekend and met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\nThe Nikkei rose 1.2 percent to 22,109.48 in midmorning trade, after hitting a high of 22,136.21, its strongest level since Feb. 28.\nIndex-heavy stocks such as Fast Retailing Co and Fanuc rallied 1.9 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively, while exporters advanced as well. Advantest rose 3.1 percent, TDK Corp jumped 4 percent and Panasonic Corp advanced 1.7 percent.\nThe broader Topix gained 0.8 percent to 1,744.43.\nEditing by Shri Navaratnam\n ",
