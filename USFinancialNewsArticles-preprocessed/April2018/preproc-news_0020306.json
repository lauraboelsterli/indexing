    "text": "WELLINGTON, April 11 (Reuters) - Gale-force winds battered New Zealand’s largest city, Auckland, leaving thousands without power on Wednesday morning as authorities urged residents to stay home.\nGusts as high as 146 kilometres (90 miles) an hour tore down trees and power lines overnight, leaving more than 100,000 homes and businesses without power and likely taking days to fix, according to electricity distributor Vector.\nRoads were littered with debris and some traffic lights were out, prompting authorities to request the more than 1.3 million residents of New Zealand’s commercial capital to stay home if possible.\n“There is damage across Auckland this morning after last night’s severe storm ... please only travel if you have to,” Auckland City Council said on its website.\nThe storm, which was expected to continue for the next few days, started pummelling the country on Tuesday, bringing unseasonable autumn snow to parts of the South Island and small tornados in the central north island.\nAir New Zealand warned that flights were likely to be affected, though most flights in and out of Auckland were running on Wednesday according to the national carrier’s website.\nHeavy rains and snow were expected to continue for the next few days and the country’s Metservice issued a warning of more severe winds in Auckland expected to hit on Thursday night.
