Such forward-looking statements may, without limitation, be preceded by, followed by, or include words such as “believes”, “expects”, “anticipates”, “estimates”, “intends”, “plans”, “continues”, “project”, “potential”, “possible”, “contemplate”, “seek”, “goal”, or similar expressions, or may employ such future or conditional verbs as “may”, “might”, “will”, “could”, “should” or “would”, or may otherwise be indicated as forward-looking statements by grammatical construction, phrasing or context. For those statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, where applicable, and applicable Canadian securities laws. Forward-looking statements are provided for the purpose of assisting readers in understanding management's current expectations and plans relating to the future. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from conclusions, forecasts or projections expressed in such statements, including, among others, risks relating to a failure to achieve the anticipated benefits expected from the acquisition, and the failure to successfully integrate the acquisition, as well as those risks discussed in our various public filings at www.sedar.com and www.sec.gov , including in our interim Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, our most recent Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with, and subsequent reports on Form 6-K furnished to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and as applicable, the Canadian Securities Administrators. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on various assumptions, many of which involve factors that are beyond our control. The material assumptions include those related to the following: we will be able to successfully integrate the acquisition; and we will be able to successfully expand our portfolio of solutions and achieve other expected benefits through this acquisition. While management believes these assumptions to be reasonable under the current circumstances, they may prove to be inaccurate. Except as required by applicable law, we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nMedia Contacts Celestica Communications (416) 448-2200 media@celestica.com Celestica Investor Relations (416) 448-2211 clsir@celestica.com\nSource:Celestica International Inc",
