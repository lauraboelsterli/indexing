(OTC:ESBS) (the “Company”) the holding company for Empire State Bank, (the “Bank”) today announced a $314 thousand increase in net income to $986 thousand, or $0.29 per common share for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $672 thousand, or $0.21 per common share for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The improvement was largely driven by a $1.3 million, or 17.4% increase in net interest income, and the $1.7 million gain on the sale of the New Paltz branch. These increases were offset largely by a $1.4 million increase in the provision for loan losses. The increase in net interest income was largely due to a $54.8 million or 27.1% increase in loans receivable to $256.8 million as of December 31, 2017 compared to $202.0 million as of December 31, 2016.\nA net loss of $116 thousand, or $0.04 per share for the quarter ended December 31, was recorded compared to net income of 333 thousand, or $0.10 per share for the period ended December 31, 2016. The primary drivers for the decrease were a $521 thousand provision for income taxes largely driven by the $383 thousand write down of the Bank’s Deferred Tax Asset. This resulted from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 in addition to a $320 thousand increase in the Provision for Loan Loss resulting from the further write-down of the Bank’s Taxi Medallion Loan portfolio.\nChief Executive Officer Philip Guarnieri stated that “the Bank continues to improve core earnings through net interest income from loan growth and continued strong asset quality. He further stated that “2017 was a pivotal year for the Bank with the successful sale of the New Paltz branch, and a successful common stock offering, both improving the capital position of the Bank. We are pleased with the growth of the loan portfolio as we focus on our core products of traditional real estate lending and expand our small business lending, including SBA loans. We will continue to move forward and focus on improving asset quality, and further improving the capital position of the Bank to support future growth.”\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer Thomas Sperzel commented that “the Bank has received approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services and the Federal Reserve to expand the branch network in Brooklyn and Staten Island, NY.” He further stated that “Management is working hard to have these branches open and operational by mid-year 2018, and expects significant contributions to deposits and loans from these locations.”\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nNet income of $986 thousand for the year to date ended December 31, 2017 compared to $672 thousand for the comparable period in 2016, representing an increase of $314 thousand, or 46.7%.

The increase was primarily attributable to $2.7 million capital raise and $988 thousand increase in retained earnings. The ratio of stockholders’ equity to total assets increased to 6.8% at December 31, 2017 from 6.7% at December 31, 2016. Book value per share increased to $5.94 at December 31, 2017, from $4.82 at December 31, 2016.\nES BANCSHARES, INC.

Further, as the values of the Taxi Medallions have continued to decline, management has established specific reserves of $1.2 million against this portfolio.

Non-interest expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased $247 thousand when compared to the same period in 2016. This net increase was primarily attributable to net increases in other expense of $100 thousand, professional fees of $72 thousand and data processing service fees of $51 thousand.\nIncome Tax Expense.
