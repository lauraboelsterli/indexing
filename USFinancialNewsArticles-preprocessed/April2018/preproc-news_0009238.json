    "text": "April 4 (Reuters) - Indiaâ€™s Jet Airways Ltd said late on Tuesday it had entered into an agreement with Boeing Co for the purchase of 75 Boeing 737 MAX narrowbody jets.\nIn an announcement to the stock exchange, Jet Airways did not say whether the agreement was a formal order or a non-binding memorandum of understanding. Boeing did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\nThe jets would be worth $8.8 billion at list prices, although airlines typically receive a significant discount from manufacturers.\nJet Airways hoped to close a deal to buy another 75 narrowbody jets by the end of March, its chief executive, Vinay Dube, told reporters at an airshow in India last month.\nReporting by Jamie Freed in SINGAPORE\n ",
