    "text": "2 COMMENTS European executives are targeting U.S. companies as a brighter economic landscape at home and abroad boosts buyer confidence.\nLower taxes and favorable foreign exchange rates are increasingly enticing for France’s JCDecaux SA, which has looked at U.S. rivals as potential acquisition targets for more than a decade.\n“The change in the U.S. tax rate will make it more attractive for us to pursue such a deal,” said finance chief David Bourg.\nEuropean companies spent $47.26 billion on U.S. targets since the beginning of the year, through April 5, according to Dealogic. That is the highest deal value for this period since 2006 and up from $37.59 billion worth of deals struck in the same period last year.\nThe total number of European acquisitions of U.S. companies declined to 113 in that period of 2018 from 172 in that part of 2017, according to Dealogic, an indication that this year’s deals are often larger.\nSanofi SA, the French pharmaceuticals company, and AXA SA, the French insurance company, have both made big U.S. transactions, with Sanofi spending over $11.4 billion for Waltham, Mass.-based Bioverativ Inc. in January. AXA in March said it would buy XL Group Ltd. for $15.3 billion.\nThe drop in the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21% makes U.S. businesses more alluring to European buyers, as does the pullback in the U.S. dollar, which is down nearly 15% against the euro since Dec. 2016.\nWärtsilä Corp., the Finnish maker of marine engines and power plants, is planning to spend hundreds of millions of euros on acquisitions this year . The company is following 15 to 20 companies, including some in the U.S., said CFO Marco Wiren.\nSmurfit Kappa Group PLC is looking for targets abroad; a U.K. factory operated by the firm in December.

Wärtsilä is prepared to spend €60 million to €400 million ($73.5 million to $490.1 million) per transaction to complement its portfolio, Mr. Wiren said.\nEuropean companies are eager buyers because of strong cash reserves, the result of years of conservative spending, in addition to the availability of cheap funding as interest rates remain near historic lows.\nSmurfit Kappa Group PLC, Europe’s largest paper packaging producer, also is looking for targets abroad , including the U.S. The company reiterated its appetite for acquisitions after Tennessee-based International Paper Co. in late March made a second bid to buy the Irish firm, which Smurfit Kappa rejected.\n“The U.S. is a growing market in terms of our business,” Smurfit Kappa CFO Ken Bowles said, adding that a larger footprint in the U.S. would allow the company to take advantage of bright economic prospects.\nThe company’s last sizable U.S. transaction was the acquisition of a company called Bates Container LLC for $150 million that closed in 2015.\nHowever, uncertainty about Washington’s stance on foreign takeovers could make some buyers pause. President Donald Trump blocked the takeover of Qualcomm Inc. in March , citing concerns about national security.\nDeal makers are also likely to proceed with caution amid escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China, which have triggered wild swings in global markets.\n“The volatility has certainly increased,” said Philipp Beck, a managing director in UBS Group AG’s mergers and acquisitions team. “This is certainly not helpful for transactions,” he said. A long-lasting trade conflict between the U.S. and China would also discourage deal making, bankers say.\nEuropean buyers must also contend with sticker shock, as U.S. companies often trade at higher valuations than their European peers. Companies in the S&P 500 command an average trailing price earnings ratio of 18.9, compared with 15.1 for the Stoxx Europe 600, according to Thomson Reuters Corp.\n“The historic valuation asymmetry has been partially compensated for by the weaker U.S. dollar,” said Borja Azpilicueta, who advises companies in Europe and elsewhere at HSBC Holdings PLC. “But there is still a relative valuation premium for many U.S. firms,” he said.\nAnd while the weaker dollar can temper the cost of a U.S. company, it also takes a toll on the income a European buyer would get from a U.S. target.\nJCDecaux’s Mr. Bourg knows that he might have to put a big offer on the table. “The price of the potential acquisition targets has always been very high,” he said.\nWrite to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com",
