Soccer Football - Championship - Cardiff City vs Wolverhampton Wanderers - Cardiff City Stadium, Cardiff, Britain - April 6, 2018 Wolverhampton Wanderers' Ruben Neves and Matt Doherty celebrate at full time with team mates Action Images/Peter Cziborra \nThe clash of the top two sides in England’s second tier was a cagey affair until former Porto midfielder Ruben Neves put the visitors ahead with a superb, dipping free-kick from 25 yards out in the 67th minute. \nCardiff should have drawn level in the fourth minute of added time but John Ruddy saved Gary Madine’s penalty and then two minutes later, after another spot kick was awarded, Junior Hoilett hit the bar. \nWhile Wolves are now 14 points ahead of third-placed Fulham, Cardiff have just a five point gap from the London club who are at Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday.
