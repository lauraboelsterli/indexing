    "text": "Gold prices hit the highest in nearly a week on Tuesday before backing off slightly, as the dollar weakened and as investors awaited potential U.S. action against the suspected use of chemical weapons in Syria.\n\"Geopolitics is taking the main driving seat this week, so gold has potentially got some room for the upside,\" said Jonathan Butler, commodities analyst at Mitsubishi in London. \"A lot will hinge on what is happening geopolitically between Russia, Syria, Iran and all sorts of other countries that could be potentially drawn into this.\"\nSpot gold was up 0.3 percent at $1,339.84 an ounce at 1:16 p.m. ET. Earlier in the day, the precious metal touched the highest level since April 4 at $1,340 an ounce. U.S. gold futures added 0.22 percent to $1,343.1 an ounce. If gold breaks through resistance of $1,340, it could move back to the late March highs just under $1,360, Butler added.\nTrump on Monday promised quick, forceful action in response to a deadly suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria, appearing to suggest a potential military response.\nGold is often seen as an alternative investment during times of political and financial uncertainty.\nGold also got a boost as the dollar index dipped to a two-week low against a basket of currencies on Tuesday after Chinese President Xi Jinping's promise to cut import tariffs eased concerns about a trade conflict. Xi promised to open the country's economy further and lower import tariffs on products including cars.\nHis comments spurred a rally in global equity markets. Markets are looking ahead to this week's Federal Reserve's minutes on its last policy meeting and U.S. CPI data for cues on the pace of interest rate hikes this year.\nIn other precious metals, silver gained 0.74 percent to $16.57 an ounce. Platinum fell 0.19 percent to $929.70 an ounce, after gaining about 2 percent in the previous session, the most in nearly two months.\nPalladium rose 2.29 percent to $950.75 an ounce. The auto catalyst metal gained over 3 percent on Monday, its biggest daily percentage rise since Jan. 12. Platinum fell back to a discount to sister metal palladium on Tuesday after rising to a premium last Thursday.\nLast September, palladium gained the upper hand over platinum for the first time in 16 years. \"We are not convinced the platinum-palladium ratio can hold consistently above parity this year as strong trends in the auto sector which have weighed on the ratio remain in place,\" UBS analyst Joni Teves said in a note.\nDiesel vehicles use mostly platinum in catalytic converters while petrol cars largely use palladium, but diesel sales in Europe's largest car markets have been falling.",
