    "text": "4 COMMENTS The commingling of North and South “seems to be my whole theme in life,” says Bruce Moffett, a Rhode Island-born chef now based in Charlotte, N.C.\nHis flagship restaurant, Barrington’s, pays homage to his New England roots while relying on local ingredients. His forthcoming cookbook is entitled “South by North.”\nA similar theme emerged when Mr. Moffett, 52, and his wife Katrina set out to renovate their redbrick 1960s ranch in Charlotte’s Barclay Downs neighborhood. They expanded the house to create a four-bedroom, roughly 3,200-square-foot space, Ms. Moffett said, large enough to accommodate both antiques from her husband’s “old-school Rhode Island” family and work by Southern artists.\nThe family’s northern provenance is apparent in the home’s entryway, where an antique New England cane chair stands next to a wicker basket of shells and stones the Moffetts collected at Rhode Island’s Matunuck Beach. On a doorknob hangs an antique buoy from Boston, where both Moffetts lived before Charlotte.\nThe commingling of North and South ‘seems to be my whole theme in life,’ says Bruce Moffett, a Rhode Island-born chef now based in Charlotte, N.C.

Photo: Chris Edwards for The Wall Street Journal Originally from Montreal, Ms. Moffett, 46, lived in Boston while working as an executive at Laura Ashley , the British fashion and home furnishings company . She relocated to Charlotte in 2001 when the company moved its Americas headquarters to Fort Mill, S.C. Mr. Moffett, meanwhile, cooked in Boston before moving in 2000 to Charlotte, opening Barrington’s shortly thereafter.\nSeated in their home’s sunny living room, the effervescent Ms. Moffett describes meeting her dark-haired husband for the first time by the pool at her Charlotte apartment complex, where she noticed that a “really cute guy who looked like John Kerry ” had a towel from the venerable New England retailer L.L. Bean. “I said, ‘who in the South would have an L.L. Bean towel?’”\nThey’ve been married 15 years, and Mr. Moffett has since opened two more restaurants: the tapas-style Good Food on Montford and Italian bistro Stagioni.\nFour years ago, they paid $555,000 for the one-story house in Barclay Downs, an area minutes from all three restaurants. “It was a dump,” Mr. Moffett remembers, but “I could envision what I wanted to do with the house.”\nMr. Moffett in the kitchen.

Photo: Chris Edwards for The Wall Street Journal They spent about $500,000 to change virtually everything, adding about 1,000 square feet to the interior and building a large cedar deck, outdoor kitchen and a two-car garage with an apartment above it. They converted the formal living room into a dining room large enough for a 12-foot long wood-and-steel table. Mr. Moffett had bought it for Stagioni, but it didn’t fit.\nA 6-foot-tall portrait of Mary Morris Brush, Mr. Moffett’s great-great-grandmother, hangs in the dining room. On the opposite wall the Moffetts built floor-to-ceiling bookshelves where antique duck decoys intermingle with New England and North Carolina pottery and a cookbook that belonged to Mr. Moffett’s grandmother. “Our memories are in here,” Ms. Moffett said.\nMore From Mansion\nVirginia Woolf’s Onetime Home Listed for $4.62 Million April 19, 2018 Luxury Homes in London With Ties to the Titanic April 11, 2018 New York Apartment Owned by Lena Horne Hits Market for $825,000 April 10, 2018 Also in the dining room there is a sketch by Pablo Picasso, and the home contains paintings by Charlotte artist Michele Harvey Collins. Both Moffetts come from art-loving families: Mr. Moffett said his grandmother bought a nude painted by the artist Henri Matisse off the street in Paris, then sold it decades later to send her grandchildren to college. A copy now hangs in the Moffetts’ bedroom.\nLaura Ashley designs were used throughout the home, but “I didn’t want this to be a showroom,” said Ms. Moffett, who is Laura Ashley’s creative manager. The floral wallpaper in the powder room is one of the company’s iconic patterns, “Summer Palace,” and the Laura Ashley pillows outside are emblazoned with hedgehogs.\nMr. Moffett’s grandmother bought a nude painted by the artist Henri Matisse off the street in Paris, then sold it decades later to send her grandchildren to college. A copy now hangs in the Moffetts’ bedroom. Photo: Chris Edwards for The Wall Street Journal In the kitchen, Mr. Moffett chose a galley-style design, which he finds more efficient for cooking than a center island. In the breakfast area, friends’ children fight over a wooden high chair that belonged to Bruce’s grandfather.\nMuch of the family’s cooking occurs outside. The outdoor kitchen has running hot and cold water, and on the lawn a few feet away, Mr. Moffett grows tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers in raised vegetable beds, often bringing the produce to Barrington’s.\nFor the apartment above the garage, they commissioned Charlotte artist Randall Kane to paint a mural depicting the scoreboard from the night the Boston Red Sox broke “the curse of the Bambino” in 2004.\nAn outdoor fireplace was requested by the Moffetts’ 8-year-old son, Daniel, who meticulously prepares the s’mores. “Our son’s the s’more chef,” Ms. Moffett said.\nEven the family’s s’mores hark back to their Northern roots: Ms. Moffett’s father handpicked the extra-long, maple marshmallow sticks in Montreal and drove them 16 hours to Charlotte.\n“My parents were like, ‘they have to be from Canada,” she said.\nWrite to Candace Taylor at Candace.Taylor@wsj.com\nMr. Moffett with his wife Katrina and son Daniel.
