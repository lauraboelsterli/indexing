    "text": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Bowing to criticism from the Singapore Exchange ( SGXL.SI ) (SGX) and other investors, embattled Noble Group ( NOBG.SI ) is removing a provision in its $3.4 billion debt restructuring proposal that penalized shareholders voting against the plan.\nFILE PHOTO: An employee is reflected on the wall as she walks past a signage of Noble Resources, a Noble Group subsidiary, at their premises in Singapore March 6, 2015. REUTERS/Edgar Su/File Photo The debt-for-equity swap is crucial for the survival of the Singapore-listed company, which has sold billions of dollars of assets, taken hefty writedowns and cut hundreds of jobs over the past three years to slash debt.\nNoble has secured the backing of its creditors, but it also needs approval from a majority of its shareholders.\n“If more than half of the shareholders vote in favor of the restructuring, all shareholders, irrespective of their vote at the special general meeting, will receive the same treatment and will participate in the restructuring,” Chairman Paul Brough said in a letter addressed to shareholders and sent to SGX late on Wednesday.\nLast month, SGX’s regulatory unit criticized Noble’s proposal and said shareholders should be able to vote freely and their vote should not have a bearing on whether they are entitled to shares in the restructured company.\nNoble is seeking to halve its debt and hand over 70 percent of the restructured business to creditors, who are mainly made up of hedge funds. Existing shareholders will get 15 percent equity in the new company.\nOnce Asia’s largest commodity trader, Noble was plunged into crisis in February 2015 when Iceberg Research questioned its books. Noble has stood by its accounting.\nNoble has warned that it is likely to enter into a formal insolvency or bankruptcy process if shareholders vote against the restructuring plan.\nIn an eight-page letter sent on Wednesday, Brough laid out why the restructuring was the only option for the company’s survival as it was already in default on its $3.4 billion of its debt obligations.\n“The company has few options and it is running out of time,” said Brough, adding that the restructuring also provides Noble with a committed trade finance facility of $700 million.\nThis week, Noble won the support of its founder and biggest shareholder, Richard Elman, who holds about 18 percent of its shares after it sweetened the terms of its proposal for shareholders. Some other equity holders have opposed the plan.\nNoble has not yet set a date for shareholders to approve the restructuring\nReporting by Anshuman Daga and Aradhana Aravindan; Editing by Himani Sarkar & Shri Navaratnam\n ",
