    "text": "22 COMMENTS CHAPEL HILL, Tenn.—Democrats are fielding challengers for nearly every GOP House incumbent this year—a change from the last midterm election in 2014, when 36 Republicans won re-election without facing a general election opponent.\nIn contrast, about 60 House Democrats won’t face a GOP opponent this November.\nThe goal is to maximize their opportunities if there is a surge in Democratic turnout, as has happened in some special elections. Democrats need a net gain of 23 seats to retake control of the House.\nThe strategy is similar to one employed in 1994 by former Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich, who recruited candidates nationwide to run for Congress. Republicans that year did catch a red wave, gaining 54 seats, enough to become the House majority. In 1995, they elected Mr. Gingrich as the first Republican speaker in 40 years.\nWhile Mr. Gingrich largely directed the 1994 effort, the expanded Democratic campaign for the 2018 midterms is both organized and somewhat propelled by a backlash to Republican dominance in Washington.\nIn Utah, Republican Rep. Rob Bishop was so confident about winning re-election in November that he announced last year he would retire in 2020. That prompted Democrat Kurt Weiland, 72, of Bountiful, Utah, to get into the race.\n“I heard that little voice inside my head that said ‘Hey, aside from several thousand dollars and several thousand hours, what can I lose?” said Mr. Weiland, a consultant and retired Army officer.\nSea of Red Showdowns The most-red seats in the country all have Democratic challengers in 2018.

Doug Jones’s surprising upset in December in an Alabama special election and Rep. Conor Lamb’s special election victory last month in a Republican House district that Mr. Trump won by 20 percentage points.\nYet, Corry Bliss, executive director of the Congressional Leadership Fund, the super PAC aligned with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.), said he would start paying attention to these candidates only if they can raise big money. “It makes no difference how good your story is and how bad the environment is, without money, none of these people are real,” he said.\nFor the past two cycles, Rep. John Ratcliffe has run without a Democratic challenger in his rural Texas district. After the 2016 election, Catherine Krantz said she “made a commitment that if we couldn’t get someone else on the ballot, then I would run.”\nMs. Krantz is running. She keeps her campaign on a shoestring budget by driving her 2006 Toyota Prius around for several hours every day talking to college student groups, city meetings and Democratic club meetings. She talks about the need to invest in infrastructure in rural communities and why the country needs universal health care.\n“We’re pretty much a hopeless district,” she said of her chances, adding that she knows her party is “focusing on the more likely swing states, the more likely swing districts. But at the same time, I think there’s some incredible opportunity here.”\nThe Democrats have a \"blue wave\" of momentum building for the 2018 midterms, thanks to a motivated base, success in special elections and a low approval rating for President Trump. Will that be enough to take back the House and the Senate? In Tennessee, Democrat Mariah Phillips recently attended a craft fair here. She chatted with volunteers at the party’s booth selling T-shirts that said “Marshall County Democrats Do Exist,” before diving into the crowd to shake hands, introduce herself to voters, and take selfies, if they asked.\nShe talked about gun policy. As a teacher she is opposed to guns in schools; as a Tennessean, she has a concealed-carry permit and says she is a “pretty good shot.”\nA topic she avoids is the president, who won the district by 30 percentage points. “I’m not running against Donald Trump, ” she said. “I’m running against Scott DesJarlais. If other people bring [Mr. Trump] up, I try to assess what they are saying—I might agree with what they are saying.”\nIf she prevails in her primary with Steven Reynolds, she will face Mr. DesJarlais, who beat Mr. Reynolds two years ago after winning 65% of the vote.\nMs. Phillips, a 41-year-old teacher and mother to five, concedes she is facing “an uphill battle. I’m going to have to fight every day to get what I need to make the connections, to build the support,” she said.\nShe spends six or seven hours a day calling potential campaign donors, sometimes followed by an event that night. One of her campaign slogans is “Have you met Mariah?” because her supporters are convinced she can win over skeptics if she can get an introduction.\nKevin Mackenzie isn’t one of them. “I’ve seen the Democrats moving so far to the left, it’s Looney Tunes,” said Mr. Mackenzie, 55, of Chapel Hill. Standing among craft booths and watching Ms. Phillips shake hands, he answered “I hope not” when asked if a Democrat could beat Mr. DesJarlais.\nA spokesman for Mr. DesJarlais said the congressman was focusing on his own primary campaign and will turn his attention to the general after August.\nWhile the candidates are long shots, the efforts by Democrats in rural areas to rebuild the party could pay off later, said Larry J. Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics.\n“Elections are connected and I tend to think that effort exerted in a midterm election really pays off two years later,” he said.\nThat is a part of what motivated Josh McCall to run against Georgia Republican Rep. Doug Collins. “The Democratic Party has not done its work to understand and appreciate as human beings people in the rural South and American West,” said the 37-year-old high-school teacher.\nWrite to Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com",
