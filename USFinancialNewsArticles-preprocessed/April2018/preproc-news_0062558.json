    "text": "WEST CHESTER, Ohio, April 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AK Steel (NYSE:AKS) today reported its financial results for the first quarter of 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nNet income of $28.7 million, or $0.09 per diluted share Adjusted EBITDA of $118.7 million, or 7.2% of sales Revenues of $1,658.9 million, an 8.2% increase from first quarter 2017\n“Our first quarter 2018 operating performance benefited from a favorable pricing environment and solid demand across most end markets, including automotive,” said Roger K. Newport, Chief Executive Officer of AK Steel. “Our performance was tempered by the previously disclosed unplanned outage at our Middletown Works in January.”\n“We remain optimistic about 2018, as we expect automotive and other key end use markets to remain strong. Additionally, the collaborative efforts between Precision Partners, AK Tube and our AK Steel technical and research teams are gaining traction at key automotive customers,” Newport said. “The high level of imports, particularly the ongoing surge of foreign electrical steel, remains a challenge and we will continue to work proactively with the Trump Administration to ensure fair and appropriate trade policies.”\nAK Steel reported net income of $28.7 million, or $0.09 per diluted share of common stock, for the first quarter of 2018. The company’s adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below) was $118.7 million, or 7.2% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2018. These results were driven by higher steel selling prices and the effect of the Precision Partners acquisition, offset by higher costs as a result of the Middletown Works unplanned outage, and increased costs for raw materials. In the quarter, the company also changed its method of accounting for certain inventories from the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method to the average cost method, which was retrospectively applied to prior-period financial statements. For the first quarter of 2017, net income was $84.4 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, and adjusted EBITDA was $178.2 million, or 11.6% of net sales. The first quarter a year ago benefited from lower cost raw materials, higher automotive sales and surcharge revenue for specialty steels. The company ended the first quarter of 2018 with total liquidity of $853.3 million, consisting of cash and cash equivalents and $819.8 million of availability under the company’s revolving credit facility.\n(Dollars in millions, except per share and per ton data) Three Months\nEnded March 31, 2018 2017 Flat-rolled steel shipments (000 tons) 1,430.9 1,456.2 Selling price per flat-rolled steel ton $ 1,045 $ 1,005 Net sales $ 1,658.9 $ 1,533.4 Operating profit 63.6 129.7 Net income attributable to AK Steel Holding Corporation 28.7 84.4 Adjusted EBITDA 118.7 178.2 Net income per diluted share attributable to AK Steel Holding Corporation $ 0.09 $ 0.26 Outlook\nThe company anticipates that market conditions will strengthen in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. Shipments of carbon and stainless steels, as well as tubular and stamping products, are expected to benefit from continued strength in the automotive market. In addition, the company anticipates increased shipments into both the distributor and converter, and the infrastructure and manufacturing markets.\nThe following additional factors are also relevant to AK Steel’s second quarter 2018 outlook:\nThe company expects flat-rolled shipments in the second quarter to be approximately 5% to 7% higher than the first quarter of 2018. The company currently estimates that the average selling price per flat-rolled ton will be about $1,075 in the second quarter, compared to $1,045 in the first quarter. The company expects outage costs to be approximately $20.0 to $25.0 million in the second quarter of 2018, compared to $31.1 million in the first quarter. As a result of anticipated improvement in pricing and volumes, the company expects its second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to improve by 1.5 to 2.0 percentage points from the first quarter of 2018.\nThe foregoing outlook is based on AK Steel’s current estimates and may change based on business conditions and other factors. There are many other items that could affect the company’s 2018 results, as outlined in the Forward-Looking Statements below, including developments in the domestic and global economies, in the company’s business, and in the businesses of the company’s customers, suppliers and competitors.\nChange from LIFO Inventory Method\nIn the first quarter of 2018, AK Steel changed its accounting method for valuing inventories to the average cost method from the LIFO method. The company believes that this method is preferable as it more closely tracks the physical flow of its inventory, better matches revenue with expenses, aligns with how the company internally manages its business, and improves comparability with peers. The effects of the change in accounting method from LIFO to average cost have been retrospectively applied to all periods presented.\nFor additional information on the company’s change from LIFO to the average cost accounting method, please refer to the Form 8-K that the company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission today, which includes recast financial statements for the prior three years reflecting this voluntary change. Nothing in that Form 8-K shall be deemed to be incorporated into this release.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call Today\nAK Steel will provide live listening access on its website for the company’s earnings conference call today at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time (April 30, 2018).

EBITDA is an acronym for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. It is a metric that is sometimes used to compare the results of different companies by removing the effects of different factors that might otherwise make comparisons inaccurate or inappropriate. For purposes of this news release, the company has made adjustments to EBITDA to exclude the effect of noncontrolling interests. The adjusted results, although not financial measures under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and not identically applied by other companies, facilitate the ability to analyze the company’s financial results in relation to those of its competitors and to the company’s prior financial performance by excluding items that otherwise would distort the comparison. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin are not, however, intended as alternative measures of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nNeither current nor potential investors in the company’s securities should rely on adjusted EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA margin as a substitute for any GAAP financial measure and the company encourages current and potential investors to review the following reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA.\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA\n(dollars in millions, except per ton) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income attributable to AK Steel Holding $ 28.7 $ 84.4 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 16.1 16.2 Income tax expense (benefit) (4.9 ) — Interest expense 37.6 39.4 Interest income (0.2 ) (0.4 ) Depreciation 54.9 55.1 Amortization 6.4 3.8 EBITDA 138.6 198.5 Less: EBITDA of noncontrolling interests (a) 19.9 20.3 Adjusted EBITDA $ 118.7 $ 178.2 Adjusted EBITDA margin 7.2 % 11.6 %\n(a) The reconciliation of EBITDA of noncontrolling interests to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is as follows: (dollars in millions) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests $ 16.1 $ 16.2 Depreciation 3.8 4.1 EBITDA of noncontrolling interests $ 19.9 $ 20.3\nAK STEEL HOLDING CORPORATION FLAT-ROLLED STEEL SHIPMENTS (Unaudited) (Tons in thousands) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Tons Shipped by Product Stainless/electrical 200.7 209.9 Coated 734.5 779.3 Cold-rolled 282.5 246.2 Hot-rolled 174.3 178.6 Other 38.9 42.2 Total shipments 1,430.9 1,456.2 Shipments by Product (%) Stainless/electrical 14 % 14 % Coated 51 % 54 % Cold-rolled 20 % 17 % Hot-rolled 12 % 12 % Other 3 % 3 % Total shipments 100 % 100 % Contacts:\nMedia – Lisa H.
