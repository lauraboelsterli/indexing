    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Friday the United States was very confident that Syria carried out a missile attack in the town of Douma last weekend, saying U.S. intelligence shows Russia’s claim that the attack was faked was false.\n“Our intelligence tells use otherwise. I can’t go beyond that,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters, when asked about Russia’s claim.\n“We have a very high confidence that Syria was responsible,” she adding, saying Russia’s failure to stop Syria has been “part of the problem.”\nReporting by Steve Holland; Writing by Tim Ahmann; Editing by Will Dunham\n ",
