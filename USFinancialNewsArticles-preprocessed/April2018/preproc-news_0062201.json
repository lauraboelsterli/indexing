    "text": "BEIJING, April 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Gridsum Holding Inc. (\"Gridsum\" or \"Company\") (NASDAQ:GSUM), a leading provider of cloud-based big-data analytics and artificial intelligence (\"AI\") solutions in China, today reported that it has received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market (\"Nasdaq\"), dated April 27, 2018 (\"Nasdaq Letter\"), notifying the Company that it is not in compliance with the requirements for continued listing under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), because it is unable to timely file its annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2017 (\"2017 Annual Report\").\nUnder Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Company has 60 calendar days from the date of the Nasdaq Letter to submit a plan as to how it plans to regain compliance with Nasdaq's continued listing requirements (\"Compliance Plan\"). If Nasdaq accepts the Company's Compliance Plan, Nasdaq may grant the Company an exception of up to 180 calendar days from the due date of the 2017 Annual Report, or until October 29, 2018, to regain compliance. If Nasdaq does not accept the Compliance Plan, the Company will have the opportunity to appeal that decision to a Nasdaq Hearings Panel. The Company intends to file submit its Compliance Plan within the prescribed 60-day period, and, if Nasdaq grants the exception, to file its 2017 Annual Report within the permitted period.\nThe Nasdaq Letter has no immediate impact on the listing of the American depositary shares representing the Company's Class B ordinary shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nThis announcement is made in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(b), which requires prompt disclosure of receipt of a deficiency notification.\nAbout Gridsum\nGridsum Holding Inc. (NASDAQ: GSUM) is a leading provider of cloud-based big-data analytics and AI solutions for multinational and domestic enterprises and government agencies in China. Gridsum's core technology, the Gridsum Big Data Platform, is built on a distributed computing framework and performs real-time multi-dimensional correlation analysis of both structured and unstructured data.
