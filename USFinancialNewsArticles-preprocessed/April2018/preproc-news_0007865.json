    "text": "0 COMMENTS Gold prices rose Friday after government data showed that the U.S. economy added fewer jobs than economists expected last month.\nFutures for June delivery rose 0.6% to $1,336.80 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, reversing earlier losses.\nOn Friday, the Labor Department said U.S. nonfarm payrolls rose by 103,000 in March, falling short of expectations for an increase of 178,000 new jobs.\nMeanwhile, the WSJ Dollar Index fell 0.2% to 83.97. Gold is priced in dollars and becomes cheaper to foreign buyers when the U.S. currency falls.\nWhile the jobs report came in weaker than expected, it should keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates as expected this year, said Tai Wong, head of metals trading at BMO Capital Markets.\n“It tells us that the path that they have chosen, which is slow, steady rate hikes, doesn’t need to change,” Mr. Wong said.\nGold pays its holders nothing and becomes less attractive to investors compared with yield-bearing assets like Treasurys when rates rise.\nMetals traders are also closely watching the latest news on trade policy between the U.S. and China, as both countries have levied tariffs against each other, and President Donald Trump threatens to escalate the punitive measures.\nMr. Trump said Thursday he was considering imposing tariffs on an additional $100 billion in imports from China. That would be on top of the levies on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods he announced earlier in the week and could provoke another retaliatory salvo from Beijing.\n“You know the Chinese will respond. It’s just a question of when,” Mr. Wong said. “It will be interesting to see how gold responds to that.”\nRelated Video President Trump says China is forcing U.S. companies to transfer their technology secrets to China. WSJ's Shelby Holliday tells you how. Illustration: Adele Morgan The White House announced its first round of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports at the end of February, and sentiment on base metals has been stung in the time since. Prices have dropped for every metal in that basket over the past month, with aluminum the hardest hit, down 6.9%, and copper 3.3% lower. On Friday, copper for May delivery fell 0.7% to $3.0530 a pound in New York.\n“We remain fairly confident that if the political posturing stops and if negotiators pick up the pace, metals could rise going into the seasonally stronger second quarter, but that’s a big if for now,” said Edward Meir, a strategist at INTL FCStone, in a Friday note.\nWrite to Stephanie Yang at stephanie.yang@wsj.com and David Hodari at David.Hodari@dowjones.com",
