    "text": "April 9, 2018 / 2:06 AM / Updated 13 minutes ago U.S. 'anxiety disorder' impacts global economy -People's Daily Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nSHANGHAI (Reuters) - The United States suffers from an “anxiety disorder” and its new protectionist trade policies have significantly impacted the global economy, the official newspaper of China’s ruling Communist Party said on Monday. Shipping containers and train wagons are seen at a port in Lianyungang, Jiangsu province, China April 6, 2018. REUTERS/Stringer \n“In the world’s perception, the U.S. is overshadowed by an anxiety disorder and is very keen to show its anxiety,” the People’s Daily said in a commentary. \nIt said the Trump administration’s focus on trade and economic issues reflected a desire to win support through populist policies ahead of U.S. mid-term elections this year, but that such policies would ultimately hurt American families through higher consumer goods prices. \nSuch anxiety stemmed from the United States’ decline in the global context and the rise of China, the editorial said.
