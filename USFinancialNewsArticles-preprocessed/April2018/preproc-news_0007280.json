The benchmark had finished its previous session up 0.2 percent.\n“The lead from Wall Street is what has prompted some local buying today,” said Christopher Conway, head of research and trading at Australian Stock Report.\nConway said that after China proposed its own new tariffs, market participants realised that the measures would not be in place for six months at least.\n“It’s all part of the negotiating process. So Wall Street looked past those trade discussions and our markets did as well,” he said.\nBanks led gains with the financial index rising 1.3 percent as the ‘Big Four’ climbed. ANZ ended an eight-day run of losses and was up 1.7 percent. Conway said ANZ had been getting towards being technically oversold.\nConsumer stocks were well-bid with Treasury Wine Estates rising 2.4 percent and Wesfarmers gaining 0.8 percent. Data out on Wednesday showed that retail sales rose more than expected in March.\nCommodity prices turned down with iron ore on the Dalian commodities exchange lower on Wednesday on worries of rising stock piles, while London copper closed 1.1 percent lower.\nMining major BHP was down 0.3 percent and rival Rio Tinto dropped 1.2 percent while Fortescue Metals , the world’s fourth-largest iron ore producer, was 2.4 percent lower.\nGas and electricity company AGL Energy hit its lowest in a week, dipping 1.3 percent a day after Australia’s Prime Minister urged AGL to consider Alinta Energy’s interest in buying AGL’s old coal-burning Liddell power plant in New South Wales state.\nMG Unit Trust, a listed funding vehicle for Australia’s Murray Goulburn dairy co-operative, was 0.5 percent lower ahead of a shareholder vote on a takeover offer from Canada’s Saputo Inc.\nThe Australian competition regulator cleared the $1 billion Saputo bid for Australia’s largest dairy producer on Wednesday.\nNew Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index was 0.2 percent, or 16.91 points, lower at 8,381.17, after two sessions of gains.\nHealthcare stocks Fisher & Paykel and Ryman Healthcare were among the biggest drags, down 0.9 percent each.\nTelco Spark New Zealand weighed most on the index, down 2.2 percent, hitting a near five-month low.\nFor more individual stocks activity click on\n$1 = 1.2975 Australian dollars Reporting by Susan Mathew in Bengaluru; additional reporting by Ambar Warrick; Editing by Eric Meijer\n ",
