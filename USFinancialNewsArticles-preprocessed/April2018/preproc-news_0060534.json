    "text": "PASADENA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Community Bank (the “Bank”) (CYHT- OTC-Pink (“Bank”)), founded in 1945, is an independent Southern California regional community bank, with assets of $3.7 billion, and headquartered in Pasadena with 16 business centers.\nAcquisition by Citizens Business Bank:\nAs previously announced, on February 26, 2018, the Bank entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and Merger with CVB Financial Corp. and Citizens Business Bank (the “Merger Agreement”) pursuant to which the Bank will merge with and into Citizens and each outstanding share of the Bank’s common stock will be exchanged for (i) 9.4595 shares of CVB Financial common stock and (ii) $56.00 in cash, subject to the adjustments set forth in the Merger Agreement. The merger is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018 subject to satisfaction of all the closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including but not limited to, receipt of all requisite shareholder and regulatory approvals.\nFinancial Highlights: Net income was $8.0 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $7.8 million in the same period of 2017, an increase of $217 thousand or 2.8%, over the prior year. Net income for the first quarter of 2018 included non-deductible merger related costs of $1.1 million. Net interest income was $31.6 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $27.8 during the first quarter of 2017. The increase in net interest income of $3.8 million for the first quarter 2018 over the same period in 2017 was primarily the result of: 1) $240 million of average loan growth; 2) higher yields on loans driven by Fed rate increases; and, 3) collections of past due loan interest. These improvements were partially offset by increased funding costs. Net interest margin increased to 3.56% from 3.24% in the same period due to the above plus growth in non-interest bearing deposits. Total loan balances at March 31, 2018 were a record $2.765 billion, representing a $248.1 million or 9.9% increase from the $2.517 billion at March 31, 2017 and representing a $24.8 million or 0.9% increase from the $2.740 billion at December 31, 2017. The Bank believes this growth reflects continued strong focus on origination of high quality loans in the greater Los Angeles area, primarily real estate and SBA loans. Non-performing assets at March 31, 2018 were $10.7 million compared to $15.0 million at March 31, 2017 and $9.8 million at December 31, 2017 reflecting continued strong asset quality. The allowance for loan losses decreased to 1.30% at March 31, 2018 compared to 1.33% at March 31, 2017, reflecting overall improvement in non-performing assets. The coverage ratio related to non-performing loans at March 31, 2018 was 363% compared to 223% at the end of March 2017. During the first quarter of 2018, a $650,000 provision for loan loss was recorded while in the first quarter of 2017 a release of $1.6 million in provision for loan losses was recorded. Deposits grew to a total of $2.824 billion as of March 31, 2018, an increase of $177.9 million or 6.7% from the total deposits of $2.646 billion as of March 31, 2017. Deposits declined from December 31, 2017 by $36.5 million primarily because certain higher rate public fund CDs and money desk CDs were not renewed. Non-interest bearing deposits increased 14.2%, or $150.1 million to $1.206 billion at March 31, 2018 compared to $1.056 billion as of March 31, 2017 and increased 2.4% or $28.6 million to $1.177 billion at December 31, 2017, a result of a Bank wide focus on increasing deposits that was initiated a few years ago. Average non-interest bearing deposits grew $163.4 million or 16.0% during first quarter 2018 over the same period in 2017. Non-interest bearing deposits as a percentage of core deposits were 47.8% and at March 31, 2018, up from 47.0% at March 31, 2017. Non-interest bearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits were 42.7% compared to 39.9% at the March 31, 2017. Non-interest expense includes an increase in salary related expenses of $947 thousand, a decrease in deferral of loan origination costs of $270 million and an increase in professional services of $1.3 million during the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the same period of 2017. Details of changes in non-interest income and non-interest expenses are provided in the financial reports attached to this document. Community Bank’s capital ratios continue to exceed “well capitalized” regulatory requirements\nDividend:\nThe Board of Directors declared a $0.50 per share cash dividend (aggregating $1.6 million) on its outstanding common stock for common shareholders of record as of May 15, 2018 and payable on or about June 1, 2018. This represents the fourteenth consecutive quarter that the Bank has declared a dividend since introducing a formal dividend practice. The dividend was approved at the regularly scheduled Board of Directors meeting held on April 26, 2018.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures:\nThe Bank believes the presentation of net income before the effect of the tax rate change passed in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the effect of the tax rate change which are both non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information that is essential to an investor's proper understanding of the results of the operations and financial condition of the Bank. See the Statement on Non-GAAP measures and related table later in this document for additional disclosures and reconciliations.\nMarket Makers\nCBank is pleased to include the following as market makers in Community Bank stock.

Managment uses non-GAAP financial measures in its analysis of the Bank's performance. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as substitutes for the financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP\nFor the Quarters Ended March 31, 2017 June 30, 2017 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2018 Selected Financial Data and Highlights Net income 7,787 8,354 10,141 442 8,004 Effect of tax rate change - - - 6,771 - Net income before effect of tax rate change $ 7,787 $ 8,354 $ 10,141 $ 7,213 $ 8,004 Statutory income tax rate 41.1 % 41.1 % 41.1 % 41.1 % 29.6 % Effective income tax rate 38.3 % 38.7 % 38.8 % 96.1 % 29.2 % Return on average equity 9.51 % 9.74 % 11.40 % 0.49 % 9.29 % Effect of tax rate change 0.00 0.00 0.00 7.51 0.00 Return on average equity before effect of tax rate change 9.51 % 9.74 % 11.40 % 8.00 % 9.29 % Return on average assets 0.87 % 0.91 % 1.08 % 0.05 % 0.87 % Effect of tax rate change 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.71 0.00 Return on average assets before the effect of tax rate change 0.87 % 0.91 % 1.08 % 0.76 % 0.87 % Earnings per share - basic $ 2.49 $ 2.67 $ 3.24 $ 0.14 $ 2.55 Effect of tax rate change 0.00 0.00 0.00 2.16 0.00 Earnings per share - basic before effect of tax rate change $ 2.49 $ 2.67 $ 3.24 $ 2.30 $ 2.55 Earnings per share - diluted $ 2.49 $ 2.66 $ 3.23 $ 0.14 $ 2.54 Effect of tax rate change 0.00 0.00 0.00 2.15 0.00 Earnings per share - diluted before effect of tax rate change $ 2.49 $ 2.66 $ 3.23 $ 2.29 $ 2.54 Weighted average shares outstanding - basic 3,131,569 3,134,095 3,134,095 3,134,095 3,134,095 Weighted average shares outstanding - dilutive 3,132,931 3,136,435 3,138,277 3,143,534 3,154,255\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180427005865/en/\nCommunity Bank\nJ.
