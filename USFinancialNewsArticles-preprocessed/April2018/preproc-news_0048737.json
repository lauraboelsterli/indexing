    "text": "April 24, 2018 / 9:10 PM / Updated 32 minutes ago Paraguay election's runner-up demands recount Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nASUNCION (Reuters) - The candidate who finished second in Paraguay’s presidential election said on Tuesday he had evidence of fraudulent voting and demanded a recount of ballots. Paraguayan presidential candidate Efrain Alegre and his wife Mirian Irun arrive for a meeting with the media in Asuncion, during national election day, Paraguay April 22, 2018. REUTERS/Jorge Adorno \nEfrain Alegre, a lawyer from the centre-left GANAR coalition, said on social media that the country’s official elections tribunal was too quick to announce that Mario Abdo of the conservative Colorado Party won the election. \n“We already have very clear samples of fraud that we are going to denounce case by case,” Alegre said. “We are going to participate in the recount.” \nInternational observers who monitored Sunday’s election reported no major irregularities. Abdo, a 46-year-old former senator who campaigned on an anti-corruption platform, is scheduled to be sworn in as president in mid-August. \nWith 97.67 percent of ballots counted on Sunday, the tribunal said Abdo won 46.44 percent to Alegre’s 42.74 percent.
