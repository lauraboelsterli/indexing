    "text": "(Reuters) - French payments company Worldline ( WLN.PA ) said on Tuesday it would remain “very active” in seeking M&A opportunities as it aims to become European industry leader, but did not name any potential targets.\nThe company reported first-quarter organic revenue up 5.8 percent to 394.1 million euros ($481.91 million), thanks to European banks seizing opportunities to outsource payments.\nWorldline’s results were boosted last year by the acquisition of Digital River World Payments, First Data Baltics and MRL PosNet.\nM&A has been a popular strategy in the sector as credit card companies and banks look to profit from the shift to electronic and online payments.\nParent company Atos recently failed in a bid to buy chipmaker Gemalto ( GTO.AS ) and integrate it into Worldline, and media reports have named Worldline as a possible buyer for French rival Ingenico ( INGC.PA ).\nThe payments company confirmed its 2018 targets.\n($1 = 0.8178 euros)\nReporting by Zuzanna Szymanska; Editing by Alexandra Hudson\n ",
