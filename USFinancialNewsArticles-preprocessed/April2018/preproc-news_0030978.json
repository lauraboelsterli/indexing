    "text": "Prince’s Paisley Park, the Minnesota home and recording studio of the late singer, has a job opening that is perfect for a Prince fan.\nIt is looking for an archivist to care for and catalogue items from Prince’s life as well as working on installing exhibitions and working with outside organizations.\nOf course, knowledge about Prince is helpful, but that alone won’t get you the job. The full-time position with benefits also requires experience in archiving , attention to detail, and the ability to work under pressure and meet deadlines. There’s also a bit of travel involved, so you’ll need your own car and may have to work on weekends and holidays, and put in overtime.\nThe job is based in Chanhassen, Minn., outside of Minneapolis, where Paisley Park is located. The home and studio complex was opened for tours full-time following the artist’s death in April 2016 from an accidental drug overdose.\nPaisley Park was previously open for tours periodically, including for the Prince: A Celebration event in 2000. However, Prince had long envisioned that Paisley Park would be open to the public, according to the job description page for P Park Management, which runs Paisley Park.",
