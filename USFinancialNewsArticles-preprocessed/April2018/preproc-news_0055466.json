    "text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass., April 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Forrester Research, Inc. (Nasdaq: FORR) today announced its 2018 first-quarter financial results.\nFirst-Quarter Financial Performance\nTotal revenues were $77.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $77.2 million for the first quarter of 2017. Research revenues were flat, and advisory services and events revenues increased 2%, compared with the first quarter of 2017. On a constant-currency basis, research revenues decreased 2%, and advisory services and events revenues increased 1%, compared with the first quarter of 2017.\nForrester adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" as amended, as of January 1, 2018, on a modified retrospective method, such that the new standard was applied to revenue transactions as of January 1, 2018. Prior-year amounts were not restated; rather, the cumulative effect of adopting the standard was recognized as of January 1, 2018. The primary effect on our financial results in the first quarter of 2018 was a reduction in revenue of approximately $2.3 million compared to the prior standards and a reduction in deferred revenue of $7.8 million from the cumulative effect of adopting the standard on January 1, 2018. In addition, accounts receivable and deferred revenue were approximately $5.7 million lower as of March 31, 2018, due to the treatment of cancelable contracts under the new standard. For the full year of 2018, Forrester expects that adopting the new standard will not have a significant effect on our financial results.\nOn a GAAP basis, net loss was $1.7 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared with a net income of $3.0 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, for the same period in 2017.\nOn a pro forma basis, net loss was $0.2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018, which reflects a pro forma effective tax rate of 31%. Pro forma net income excludes stock-based compensation of $2.0 million and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of $0.2 million. This compares with pro forma net income of $3.2 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, for the same period in 2017, which reflects a pro forma tax rate of 40%. Pro forma net income for the first quarter of 2017 excludes stock-based compensation of $2.0 million, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of $0.2 million, and investment losses of $0.2 million.\n\"Forrester attained revenue guidance for the first quarter of 2018 but missed EPS guidance,\" said George F. Colony, Forrester's chairman and chief executive officer. \"Our EPS shortfall was primarily driven by the impact of the new revenue accounting rules, but we do not expect it to affect our full-year earnings. We are seeing meaningful progress in executing our strategy and remain confident in our view for 2018; therefore, we are leaving our full-year 2018 guidance unchanged.\"\nForrester is providing second-quarter 2018 financial guidance as follows:\nSecond-Quarter 2018 (GAAP):\nTotal revenues of approximately $92.0 million to $95.0 million. Operating margin of approximately 7.2% to 9.2%. Other income (expense), net of zero. An effective tax rate of 31%. Diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.29 to $0.33.\nSecond-Quarter 2018 (Pro Forma):\nPro forma financial guidance for the second quarter of 2018 excludes stock-based compensation expense of $1.9 million to $2.1 million, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of approximately $0.2 million, and any investment gains or losses.\nPro forma operating margin of approximately 9.5% to 11.5%. Pro forma effective tax rate of 31%. Pro forma diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.37 to $0.41.\nOur full-year 2018 guidance is as follows:\nFull-Year 2018 (GAAP):\nTotal revenues of approximately $352.0 million to $360.0 million. Operating margin of approximately 7.5% to 8.5%. Other income (expense), net of zero. An effective tax rate of 31%. Diluted earnings per share of approximately $1.03 to $1.10.\nFull-Year 2018 (Pro Forma):\nPro forma financial guidance for full-year 2018 excludes stock-based compensation expense of $8.3 million to $8.8 million, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of approximately $0.7 million, and any investment gains or losses.\nPro forma operating margin of approximately 10.0% to 11.0%. Pro forma effective tax rate of 31%. Pro forma diluted earnings per share of approximately $1.38 to $1.45.\nQuarterly Dividend\nForrester also announced today that its board of directors has approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share, payable June 27, 2018, to shareholders of record on June 13, 2018.\nAbout Forrester Research\nForrester Research is one of the most influential research and advisory firms in the world.

Our\npro forma presentation excludes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, stock-based compensation, net gains\nor losses from investments, as well as their related tax effects. We also utilized an assumed tax rate of 31% in 2018 and\n40% in 2017, which excludes items such as any release of reserves for uncertain tax positions established in prior years and\nthe effect of any adjustments related to the filing of prior year tax returns. The pro forma data does not purport to be prepared\nin accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States.\n(2) The tax effect of adjusting items is based on the accounting treatment and rate for the jurisdiction of each item.\n(3) To compute pro forma net income, we apply a pro forma effective tax rate of 31% in 2018 and 40% in 2017.\nForrester Research, Inc.\nKey Financial Data\n(Unaudited, dollars in thousands)\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\n2018\n2017\nBalance sheet data:\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable investments\n$ 136,331\n$ 134,123\nAccounts receivable, net\n$ 62,154\n$ 70,023\nDeferred revenue\n$ 155,425\n$ 145,207\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nCash flow data:\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$ 7,805\n$ 19,454\nPurchases of property and equipment\n$ (1,324)\n$ (1,540)\nRepurchases of common stock\n$ (4,367)\n$ (21,453)\nDividends paid\n$ (3,611)\n$ (3,462)\nAs of\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nMetrics:\nAgreement value\n$ 246,400\n$ 236,600\nClient retention\n75%\n74%\nDollar retention\n88%\n87%\nEnrichment\n98%\n94%\nNumber of clients\n2,349\n2,427\nAs of\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nHeadcount:\nTotal headcount\n1,379\n1,375\nProducts and advisory services staff\n524\n512\nSales force\n519\n535\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/forrester-research-reports-2018-first-quarter-financial-results-300637671.html\nSOURCE Forrester",
