    "text": "LAS VEGAS, MGM Growth Properties LLC (\"MGP\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: MGP) today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Net income attributable to MGP Class A shareholders for the quarter was $15.8 million, or $0.22 per dilutive share.\nFinancial highlights for the first quarter of 2018:\nRental revenue was $186.6 million; Net income was $58.2 million, or $0.22 per diluted Operating Partnership unit; Funds From Operations (1) (\"FFO\") was $131.2 million, or $0.49 per diluted Operating Partnership unit; Adjusted Funds From Operations (2) (\"AFFO\") was $140.6 million, or $0.53 per diluted Operating Partnership unit; Adjusted EBITDA (3) was $185.7 million; and General and administrative expenses were $3.9 million.\nOn April 4, 2018, MGP entered into an agreement with Milstein Entertainment LLC to acquire the Hard Rock Rocksino Northfield Park (\"Rocksino\") for approximately $1.06 billion. The agreement provides that a taxable REIT subsidiary wholly owned by the Operating Partnership will acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests in Northfield Park Associates LLC, which owns and operates the Rocksino. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2018 and is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.\n\"MGP is off to a successful start in 2018 in what will be an exciting year for our shareholders. The second base rent escalator under our Master Lease of 2% went into effect on April 1, 2018, resulting in an annual rent amount of $770.3 million for our third lease year,\" said James Stewart, CEO of MGM Growth Properties. \"On April 4th, we entered into an agreement to purchase the Hard Rock Rocksino Northfield Park. The property is a market leader in the region and further diversifies our holdings geographically. We anticipate the property will add $50 - 60 million of annual rent, which is expected to represent a rent coverage of approximately 1.8x. The attractive addition to our portfolio is expected to result in mid to high single digit accretion to AFFO per share. We expect to ultimately sell the entities holding the licenses and operating assets to a third-party operator. We are looking forward to closing the transaction in the second half of 2018 and continuing to execute on our business strategy.\"\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of MGP's net income to FFO, AFFO and Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018 (in thousands, except unit and per unit amounts):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nNet income\n$\n58,169\nDepreciation\n68,991\nProperty transactions, net\n4,086\nFunds From Operations\n131,246\nAmortization of financing costs and cash flow hedges\n3,109\nNon-cash compensation expense\n384\nNet effect of straight-line rent and amortization of deferred revenue\n1,696\nAcquisition-related expenses\n541\nAmortization of above market lease, net\n171\nOther non-operating expenses\n2,184\nProvision for income taxes\n1,231\nAdjusted Funds From Operations\n140,562\nInterest income\n(1,032)\nInterest expense\n49,230\nAmortization of financing costs and cash flow hedges\n(3,109)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n185,651\nWeighted average Operating Partnership units outstanding\nBasic\n266,104,264\nDiluted\n266,265,043\nNet income per Operating Partnership units outstanding\nBasic\n$\n0.22\nDiluted\n$\n0.22\nFFO per Operating Partnership unit\nDiluted\n$\n0.49\nAFFO per Operating Partnership unit\nDiluted\n$\n0.53\nFinancial Position\nThe Company had $280.1 million of cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2018. Cash received from rent payments under the master lease for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $189.2 million. In addition, effective as of April 1, 2018, annual rent payments due under the master lease increased to $770.3 million.\nOn April 13, 2018, MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP (\"Operating Partnership\") made a cash distribution of $111.7 million relating to the first quarter dividend declared with respect to the Operating Partnership units, $81.9 million of which was paid to subsidiaries of MGM Resorts and $29.8 million was paid to MGP. Simultaneously, MGP paid a cash dividend of $0.42 per Class A share.\nThe Company successfully amended the Operating Partnership's $1.813 billion term loan B facility to reduce the interest rate to LIBOR plus 2.00%, which represents a 25 basis point reduction compared to the prior rate of LIBOR plus 2.25%. The amendment also included an extension of the maturity of the term loan B facility by 2 years to March 23, 2025 and was repriced at 99.75%. In addition, the Operating Partnership will receive a further reduction to the interest rate to LIBOR plus 1.75% upon a corporate rating upgrade by either S&P or Moody's. The effectiveness of the maturity extension is subject to certain conditions, which are expected to occur in May 2018.\n\"In the first quarter of 2018, MGP repriced the Term Loan B credit facility to a new rate of L+2.00%, resulting in an annual cash interest expense savings of $4.5 million,\" said Andy Chien, CFO of MGM Growth Properties. \"Continuing to improve our capital structure remains a top priority as part of our objective to deliver value for our shareholders. Maintaining a strong balance sheet allows us to be in position to pursue acquisitions such as the Hard Rock Rocksino Northfield Park and accretively grow our portfolio.\"\nThe Company's long-term debt at March 31, 2018 was as follows (in thousands):\nMarch 31, 2018\nSenior Secured Credit Facility:\nTerm Loan A Facility\n$\n270,000\nTerm Loan B Facility\n1,813,000\nRevolving Credit Facility\n窶能n5.625% Senior Notes due 2024\n1,050,000\n4.50% Senior Notes due 2026\n500,000\n4.50% Senior Notes due 2028\n350,000\nTotal principal amount of long-term debt\n3,983,000\nLess: unamortized debt issuance costs\n(57,797)\nTotal long-term debt, net of unamortized debt issuance costs\n$\n3,925,203\nConference Call Details\nMGP will host a conference call at 12:30 p.m. Eastern Time today which will include a brief discussion of these results followed by a question and answer period.

Management believes that this is especially true since these measures exclude real estate depreciation and amortization expense and management believes that real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight-line basis over time. The Company believes such a presentation also provides investors with a meaningful measure of the Company's operating results in comparison to the operating results of other REITs. Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors to further supplement AFFO and FFO and to provide investors a performance metric which excludes interest expense. In addition to non-cash items, the Company adjusts AFFO and Adjusted EBITDA for acquisition-related expenses. While we do not label these expenses as non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, management believes that it is helpful to adjust for these expenses when they do occur to allow for comparability of results between periods because each acquisition is (and will be) of varying size and complexity and may involve different types of expenses depending on the type of property being acquired and from whom.\nFFO, FFO per unit, AFFO, AFFO per unit and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent cash flow from operations as defined by U.S. GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income as defined by U.S. GAAP and are not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. Investors are also cautioned that FFO, FFO per unit, AFFO, AFFO per unit and Adjusted EBITDA as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other REITs due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions.\nReconciliations of net income to FFO, AFFO and Adjusted EBITDA are included in this release.\nAbout MGM Growth Properties\nMGM Growth Properties LLC (NYSE:MGP) is one of the leading publicly traded real estate investment trusts engaged in the acquisition, ownership and leasing of large-scale destination entertainment and leisure resorts, whose diverse amenities include casino gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment and retail offerings.

MGP has based forward-looking statements on management's current expectations and assumptions and not on historical facts.

These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such forward-looking statements include risks related to MGP's ability to receive, or delays in obtaining, any regulatory approvals required to own its properties, or other delays or impediments to completing MGP's planned acquisitions or projects, including any acquisitions of properties from MGM; the ultimate timing and outcome of any planned acquisitions or projects; MGP's ability to maintain its status as a REIT; the availability of and the ability to identify suitable and attractive acquisition and development opportunities and the ability to acquire and lease those properties on favorable terms; MGP's ability to access capital through debt and equity markets in amounts and at rates and costs acceptable to MGP; changes in the U.S. tax law and other state, federal or local laws, whether or not specific to REITs or to the gaming or lodging industries; and other factors described in MGP's period reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
