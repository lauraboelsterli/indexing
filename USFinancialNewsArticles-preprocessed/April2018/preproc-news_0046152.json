    "text": "VALBONNE, France--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News:\nTxCell SA (FR0010127662 – TXCL) (Paris:TXCL), a developer of cellular immunotherapies based on regulatory T cells (Tregs) for inflammation, autoimmunity and transplantation, today reports its cash position and its revenue for the first quarter of 2018. In addition, TxCell announces the availability of its 2017 registration document (document de référence) submitted to the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) on April 25, 2018.\nCash position and revenues as at March 31, 2018\nAs at March 31 st , 2018, the cash and cash equivalents amounted to €3.6 million 1 , after pre-financing of the 2017 Research Tax Credit for €1.9 million and drawing of the first two monthly tranches of the amended financing program of notes convertible into shares with share subscription warrants (OCABSA) for a nominal amount of €3 million.\nAs a reminder, this OCABSA program consists of monthly installments for a nominal amount of €1.2 million each 2 at TxCell’s sole discretion, for a total financing of up to €15 million. It should enable the Company to finance its activities until early 2019, including the filing of a clinical trial application (“CTA”) for the start of TxCell’s first-in-man study with a CAR Treg, expected to occur in Q4 2018.\nTxCell is actively working towards securing a longer-term financing solution, such as a strategic partnership and/or an equity offering, depending on market conditions. The Company may interrupt these monthly OCABSA issuances at any time.\nAs expected, TxCell did not generate revenues during the first quarter 2018.\nAvailability of the 2017 document de référence\nTxCell’s 2017 document de référence is available on the AMF’s website ( www.amf-france.org ), as well as on the Company’s website ( www.txcell.fr ) in the Investors > Documentation > Annual Reports section.\nThe 2017 document de référence notably includes the following information:\nthe 2017 annual financial report; the report on corporate governance; the statutory auditors' report and the amount of their fees; and the description of the share repurchase program.\nInvestors are invited to read the “Risk factors” section which has been updated in Chapter 4 of the 2017 document de référence.\nIn addition, the preparatory documents for the Shareholders' Meeting of April 26, 2018, referred to by Article R.225-83 of the French Commercial Code, have been posted on the Company's website and made available to shareholders free of charge under the conditions and within the deadlines provided for by the applicable regulatory provisions.\nNext financial milestones\nAnnual Shareholders’ Meeting: Thursday, April 26, 2018 Q2 2018 financial information: Thursday, July 19, 2018 (post-market) Half-year 2018 financial results: Wednesday, September 19, 2018 (post-market)\nAbout TxCell – www.txcell.com\nTxCell is a biotechnology company that develops platforms for innovative, personalized T cell immunotherapies for the treatment of severe inflammatory and autoimmune diseases with high unmet medical need. TxCell is targeting transplantation as well as a range of autoimmune diseases (both T-cell and B-cell-mediated), such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases or inflammatory skin diseases.\nTxCell’s cellular immunotherapies are based on regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs). Tregs are a T cell population discovered in the nineties for which anti-inflammatory properties have been demonstrated. Contrary to conventional approaches based on non-specific polyclonal Tregs, TxCell is exclusively developing engineered antigen-specific Tregs, where the antigen specificity is brought by a Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) (CAR-Treg cells).\nBased in Sophia-Antipolis, France, TxCell is listed on Euronext Paris and currently has 46 employees.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of TxCell, which shall not be considered per se as historical facts, including TxCell’s ability to develop, market, commercialize and achieve market acceptance for specific products, estimates for future performance and estimates regarding anticipated operating losses, future revenues, capital requirements, needs for additional financing.
