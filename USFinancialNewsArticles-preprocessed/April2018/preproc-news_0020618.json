    "text": "LONDON, April 11 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May has called an unscheduled meeting of her cabinet on Thursday in order to update senior ministers on a “fast-moving week,” a spokesman for May said.\nEarlier on Wednesday, the BBC said May was ready to give the go-ahead for Britain to take part in military action in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria, without seeking approval from parliament.\nMay’s spokesman did not comment on the agenda of the cabinet meeting.
