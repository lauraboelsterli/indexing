    "text": "0 COMMENTS Good morning. We heard Friday that industry legend Irwin Gotlieb, the chairman of GroupM, is retiring after a whopping 48 years in the business. What’s he got planned for his next act? A well-earned rest, for one. Ad Age reports Mr. Gotlieb hasn’t ever taken off two consecutive weeks of vacation time in all of those decades of service. Bon voyage!\nBe Prepared Mark Zuckerberg probably didn’t have much time to put his feet up over the weekend as he called upon the services of a team from the WilmerHale law firm to help him prepare and keep his cool during his two days of grillings from the Senate and House committees this week, WSJ reports. With the Cambridge Analytica data-sharing scandal still up close in the rearview mirror, the Facebook CEO is expected to be questioned about how the social network can better protect users’ information as lawmakers contemplate the best way to regulate digital platforms. What might regulation look like? WSJ has a guide on some of the most plausible options . Meanwhile, just in time for those hearings Tuesday and Wednesday, Facebook said Friday that it will soon require that advertisers wanting to run ads on hot-button political issues go through an authorization process first . Meanwhile, if you run a Facebook page with a large number of followers, you may be asked to verify your identity and location, the social network also said Friday.\n—Iced Cube—\nNot so great, timing-wise for Facebook, was a CNBC scoop that dropped Sunday. The social network has suspended CubeYou from its platform after CNBC discovered the data analytics firm was using personality quizzes labeled “for non-profit academic research” and shared that information with marketers. Sound familiar? Facebook thanked CNBC for bringing the issue to its attention and said that if CubeYou fails its audit, all the data firm’s apps will be banned from the social network. Elsewhere, Facebook said Friday that it has suspended AggregateIQ , a political consultancy whistleblower Christopher Wylie said he helped set up while working for Cambridge Analytica parent company SCL. AggregateIQ has previously denied a link to Cambridge Analytica or SCL.\nYou Can’t Escape My Private Eyes Mr. Zuckerberg’s testimony later this week likely will touch upon the work the social network is doing to comply with Europe’s forthcoming General Data Protection Regulation. Mr. Zuckerberg said earlier this month that the company intends to make the same privacy controls and settings available everywhere in the world, not just Europe. While Facebook has taken much of the rap in recent weeks over user privacy issues, the latest column from WSJ’s Christopher Mims looks at how Apple, Google and Amazon are also likely to face emboldened regulators over their data policies. In the advertising world, there’s a worry GDPR will make the leading tech platforms’ so-called walled gardens even taller. Case in point: AdExchanger reports that starting in May, YouTube no longer will support third-party ad serving on reserved ad buys in Europe , and it’s looking at whether to extend the policy globally. AdExchanger says some industry observers worry Google is using GDPR as a weapon to cut out third-party ad tech providers, further strengthening its leading position in the ad tech market.\nWhat’s Next for Madison Avenue and #MeToo Like many other industries, the advertising sector has been in the midst of a #MeToo reckoning in recent months. There have been high-profile lawsuits and high-profile male executives dismissed from their jobs. Adweek places a magnifying glass over how the ad industry has faced up to some of its most troubling issues and how a boys’ club culture, nondisclosure agreements, and a fear of being ostracized have prevented people from reporting incidents of discrimination and harassment. One male chief creative officer at a holding group agency said, “For years, if not forever, there was not only forgiveness but support for the idea that creative minds come from a unique, dark, damaging place. They’ve been rewarded and even admired for [bad behavior].” Undoing those underlying issues won’t be easy. Even Time’s Up Advertising—led by a group of 180 female advertising leaders who are calling for new industry policies to prevent inequality, discrimination and abuse—says on its website, “We don’t for a minute believe we found all the answers.”\nThe Big Four, Oh Consulting firms have been extremely busy buying up advertising and design agencies, a land grab with the purpose of diverting more marketing budgets in their direction. In response, many agencies, like Publicis with its Sapient unit , have been bolstering their consulting practices. Consulting, beyond the marketing department to the entire c-suite, is big business. At the Big Four accounting firms—Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young and KPMG—total global revenue from consulting and advisory work now exceeds traditional auditing, where revenue growth has been relatively flat, WSJ reports. But some investors fear the growth in consulting for those firms could have the potential for conflicts of interest and a lack of focus within their core auditing discipline. An old debate is bubbling again: Should the Big Four be broken up? Keeping the auditing and consulting businesses together raises questions about impartiality; on the other hand, keeping both businesses under the same roof gives the auditors easier access to technology and expertise about their clients’ businesses.\nBest of the rest A coalition of more than 20 consumer advocacy groups is expected to file a complaint with federal officials Monday claiming that YouTube has been collecting and profiting from the personal information of young children on its main service, in violating of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. In a statement, YouTube said it hadn’t received the complaint yet but that “protecting kids and families has always been a top priority for us.” [ New York Times ]\nYouTube reportedly will release a curated, nonalgorithmic version of the YouTube Kids app. The announcement of a whitelisted version, which will exist alongside the algorithmic one, comes after various investigations from journalists found the YouTube Kids app had served up inappropriate content. [ BuzzFeed News ]\nLaura Ingraham is returning to host “The Ingraham Angle” on Fox News on Monday night, but some advertisers are reportedly continuing to avoid the show, which will lead to lighter ad loads. The advertiser boycott is in response to Ms. Ingraham mocking Parkland shooting survivor and activist David Hogg on Twitter, for which she has apologized. [ CNN ]\nGiven all the media M&A mega-moves, there’s a lot of uncertainty heading into this year’s TV upfront. [ Adweek ]\nYouth-focused digital video network AwesomenessTV is staffing up its in-house division that makes video series for marketers.
