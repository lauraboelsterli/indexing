    "text": "Longtime Marketing Leader Promoted as Company Undertakes New Growth Path\nDENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Valen Analytics ®, an Insurity company, and provider of proprietary data, analytics and predictive modeling for P/C insurers, today announced that Kirstin Marr has been appointed president of the company, effective immediately. In more than six years as CMO, Marr lead growth and marketing initiatives, establishing Valen as a pioneer in predictive analytics for insurers focused on meeting customer demands for transparency, responsiveness and fairness in risk assessment, pricing, customer acquisition and claims handling. The company consistently grew more than 50% YoY prior to being acquired by Insurity.\n“The Valen team has achieved so much as an early mover in InsurTech, establishing the advanced and predictive analytics category that a majority of insurers rely on today,” said Marr. “As the company enters its next growth phase, there is significant opportunity to leverage existing relationships and establish new products and integrations that reinforce the value insurers can gain from analytics.”\nThroughout her career, Marr has held a variety of leadership roles in marketing and media, with organizations like HomeAdvisor and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. With Valen, she was a founding member of the Insurance Careers Movement, a grassroots organization that’s grown to include more than 1,000 companies globally. She has also been involved in several non-profits focused on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education, among other non-profit causes.\n“With her exceptional knowledge of the space and proven ability to deliver meaningful growth, Kirstin is uniquely qualified to oversee Valen’s continued trajectory,” said Chris Giglio, CEO of Insurity. “We believe Valen can be most successful as both a standalone provider of analytics for insurers and as a critical component of Insurity’s solution portfolio.”\nDax Craig, who served as Valen’s President and CEO since co-founding the company in 2004, will remain with Valen in an advisory role.
