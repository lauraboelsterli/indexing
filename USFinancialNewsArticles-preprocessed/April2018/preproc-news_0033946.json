Vincent Bollore, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of media group Vivendi, speaks during the company's shareholders meeting in Paris, France, April 19, 2018. REUTERS/Charles Platiau \nThe French media group, which holds a stake of 24 percent in TIM, faces the opposition of U.S. activist fund Elliott, which is asking for substantial changes at the TIM board.

Bollore Group ( BOLL.PA ) currently owns close to 8 percent in Mediobanca. \n“Some people said it was an absurd investment, but at the end of the day, we earned a lot of money,” said Bollore.
