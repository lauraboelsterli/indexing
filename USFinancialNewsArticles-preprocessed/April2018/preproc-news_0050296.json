    "text": "April 22, 2018 / 5:18 AM / Updated 8 hours ago Oakland's Manaea tosses no-hitter against red-hot Boston Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Oakland Athletics pitcher Sean Manaea pitched the first no-hitter of the 2018 Major League Baseball season, blanking the Boston Red Sox in a 3-0 victory on Saturday. Apr 21, 2018; Oakland, CA, USA; Oakland Athletics pitcher Sean Manaea (55) throws a pitch during the second inning against the Boston Red Sox at Oakland Coliseum. Mandatory Credit: Kiel Maddox-USA TODAY Sports \nManaea struck out 10 batters and walked just two on a night the Red Sox were no-hit for the first time since 1993. \nBoston’s Hanley Ramirez grounded into a fielder’s choice for the game’s final out, as Manaea was mobbed by his Oakland team mates. \n“Oh man, my heart was beating out of my chest, and I was trying to do everything I could (to stay calm),” Manaea said in a post-game interview. The 26-year-old had yet to throw a complete game before Saturday. Slideshow (2 Images) \n“I just kept telling myself, keep everything the same, and not let anything get too big for me,” Manaea said. \nThe Red Sox dropped to 17-3 and saw an eight-game winning streak stopped. \nBoston’s streak of 3,987 games without being no-hit was the second-longest active streak in baseball. Only Oakland (4,242) has gone longer without being no-hit. Writing by Jahmal Corner in Los Angeles; editing by Amlan Chakraborty",
