    "text": "TORONTO, Brigadier Gold Limited (\"Brigadier\" or the \"Company\") (NEX:BRG.H) is pleased to announce the closing of a private placement offering (the “Offering”) of $470,000 of gross proceeds based on the issuance of 4,700,000 units (the “Units”) at a price of $0.10 per Unit. Each Unit consists of one common share (a “Common Share”) and one common share purchase warrant (a “Warrant”). Each Warrant entitles the holder to acquire one (1) common share at an exercise price of $0.15 until April 19, 2019. The Company paid arms length finder’s fees of $18,800 and issued finders a total of 188,000 Warrants. The Common Shares and Warrants are subject to a resale restriction until August 20, 2018. Closing of the Offering remains subject to receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals, including final approval of the TSX Venture Exchange.\nCertain directors of the Company acquired a portion of the Offering, and their participation (the \"Insider Participation\") is considered to be a \"related party transaction\" as defined under Multilateral Instrument 61-101 (\"MI 61-101\"). The Insider Participation is exempt from the formal valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements of MI 61-101.\nThe net proceeds of the private placement will be used for general corporate purposes while the Company continues to evaluate various corporate strategies and opportunities.\nFor further information, please contact Grant Hall, President and CEO at (520) 668-4101.\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nBrigadier Gold Limited\nGrant Hall, President & CEO\n(520) 668-4101\ninfo@brigadiergold.com\nSource: Brigadier Gold Limited",
