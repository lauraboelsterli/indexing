At March 31, 2018, the allocation to the PT RMBS portfolio decreased by 9% to approximately 65%.\nThe table below details the changes to the respective sub-portfolios during the quarter, as well as the returns generated by each.\n(in thousands) Portfolio Activity for the Quarter Structured Security Portfolio Pass-Through Interest-Only Inverse Interest Portfolio Securities Only Securities Sub-total Total Market value - December 31, 2017 $ 3,623,685 $ 86,918 $ 34,208 $ 121,126 $ 3,744,811 Securities purchased 520,778 27,729 - 27,729 548,507 Securities sold (387,991 ) - - - (387,991 ) Losses on sales (8,338 ) - - - (8,338 ) Return of investment n/a (6,268 ) (1,609 ) (7,877 ) (7,877 ) Pay-downs (71,616 ) n/a n/a n/a (71,616 ) Premium lost due to pay-downs (4,954 ) n/a n/a n/a (4,954 ) Mark to market (losses) gains (74,195 ) 11,820 (4,383 ) 7,437 (66,758 ) Market value - March 31, 2018 $ 3,597,369 $ 120,199 $ 28,216 $ 148,415 $ 3,745,784 The tables below present the allocation of capital between the respective portfolios at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, and the return on invested capital for each sub-portfolio for the three month period ended March 31, 2018.

These figures include the structured securities in the portfolio, but do not include the effect of the Company’s funding cost hedges. Effective duration Quote: s for individual investments are obtained from The Yield Book, Inc.\nFinancing, Leverage and Liquidity\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had outstanding repurchase obligations of approximately $3,619.3 million with a net weighted average borrowing rate of 1.86%. These agreements were collateralized by RMBS with a fair value, including accrued interest, of approximately $3,818.6 million and cash pledged to counterparties of approximately $28.6 million. The Company’s leverage ratio at March 31, 2018 was 8.5 to 1. At March 31, 2018, the Company’s liquidity was approximately $197.2 million, consisting of unpledged RMBS (excluding the value of the unsettled purchases) and cash . To enhance our liquidity even further, we may pledge more of our structured RMBS as part of a repurchase agreement funding, but retain the cash in lieu of acquiring additional assets. In this way we can, at a modest cost, retain higher levels of cash on hand and decrease the likelihood we will have to sell assets in a distressed market in order to raise cash. Below is a list of our outstanding borrowings under repurchase obligations at March 31, 2018.\n($ in thousands) Weighted Weighted Total Average Average Outstanding % of Borrowing Amount Maturity Counterparty Balances Total Rate at Risk (1) in Days J.P.

The Company has not elected hedging treatment under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in order to align the accounting treatment of its derivative instruments with the treatment of its portfolio assets under the fair value option election. As such, all gains or losses on these instruments are reflected in earnings for all periods presented. At March 31, 2018, such instruments were comprised of Eurodollar and Treasury note (“T-Note”) futures contracts and interest rate swap agreements.\nThe table below presents information related to the Company’s Eurodollar and T-Note futures contracts at March 31, 2018.\n($ in thousands) Average Weighted Weighted Contract Average Average Notional Entry Effective Open Expiration Year Amount Rate Rate Equity (1) Eurodollar Futures Contracts (Short Positions) 2018 $ 1,333,333 1.92 % 2.40 % $ 4,743 2019 1,500,000 2.16 % 2.69 % 8,060 2020 1,500,000 2.64 % 2.81 % 2,480 Total / Weighted Average $ 1,454,545 2.28 % 2.66 % $ 15,283 Treasury Note Futures Contracts (Short Positions) (2) June 2018 5-year T-Note futures (Jun 2018 - Jun 2023 Hedge Period) $ 165,000 2.94 % 2.87 % $ (472 ) (1) Open equity represents the cumulative gains (losses) recorded on open futures positions from inception.\n(2) T-Note futures contracts were valued at a price of $114.46 at March 31, 2018.

We have elected to start our comparison beginning with Orchid's first full operating quarter, which was the second quarter of 2013. The Orchid IPO price was $15.00 per share on February 13, 2013, and Orchid paid its first dividend of $0.135 per share in March 2013. The book value per share at March 31, 2013 was $14.98.\n(5) As of April 26, 2018, earnings data for the first quarter of 2018 was not available for all companies included in the peer average calculation.\nBook Value Per Share\nThe Company's book value per share at March 31, 2018 was $8.09. The Company computes book value per share by dividing total stockholders' equity by the total number of shares outstanding of the Company's common stock. At March 31, 2018, the Company's stockholders' equity was $429.5 million with 53,072,169 shares of common stock outstanding.\nStock Offerings\nOn August 2, 2017, we entered into an equity distribution agreement (the “August 2017 Equity Distribution Agreement”) with two sales agents pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate amount of $125,000,000 of shares of our common stock in transactions that are deemed to be “at the market” offerings and privately negotiated transactions. Through March 31, 2018, we issued a total of 7,746,052 shares under the August 2017 Equity Distribution Agreement for aggregate gross proceeds of $76.0 million, and net proceeds of approximately $74.7 million, net of commissions and fees.\nStock Repurchase Program\nOn July 29, 2015, the Board of Directors passed a resolution authorizing the repurchase of up to 2,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. As part of the stock repurchase program, shares may be purchased in open market transactions, including through block purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Open market repurchases will be made in accordance with Exchange Act Rule 10b-18, which sets certain restrictions on the method, timing, price and volume of open market stock repurchases. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases is determined by the Company in its discretion and is subject to economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The authorization does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at the Company’s discretion without prior notice. Through December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased a total of 1,216,243 shares under the stock repurchase program at an aggregate cost of approximately $10.8 million, including commissions and fees, for a weighted average price of $8.92 per share. On February 8, 2018, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the stock repurchase program for up to an additional 4,522,822 shares of the Company’s common stock, which results in a total authorization under the stock repurchase program for up to 5,306,579 shares, or approximately 10% of our outstanding shares of common stock. This stock repurchase program has no termination date. There were no shares purchased under this program during three months ended March 31, 2018.\nManagement Commentary\nCommenting on the first quarter, Robert E. Cauley, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “The market environment changed in the first quarter of 2018. Starting in January, the specter of inflation may have finally appeared, and the rates market reacted forcefully. Evidence of pricing pressures in the economic data, and federal legislation that will add materially to the budget deficit over the next few years, caught the market by surprise and interest rates rose quickly over the first six weeks of the quarter. The 10-year U.S. treasury came within a few basis points of 3% for the first time since early 2014. The U.S. treasury curve steepened and market participants reconsidered their expectations for future rate hikes by the Federal Reserve (the “Fed”). For their part, Fed officials were very consistent in support of continued gradual rate hikes. While last Labor Day the 10-year U.S. treasury was close to 2%, and the market was only expecting one more rate hike by the end of 2018, the outlook was much different by February 2018. As reflected in Fed funds futures, the market expects two more rate hikes in 2018, in addition to the hike in March. Funding pressures in the short-term funding markets emerged and LIBOR, the primary floating rate index, moved from less than 1.70% (3-month LIBOR) at the end of 2017 to approximately 2.31% by March 31, 2018.\n“The sell-off in the rates market reversed in late February/early March as the Trump administration initially announced potential tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. This was followed in short order by counter-threats from essentially all U.S. trading partners and, in turn, more threats from the administration. The latter were met with even more counter-threats. The prospect of a meaningful trade war spooked the markets and equities sold off as interest rates rallied. These fears diminished meaningfully in April and the markets have stabilized. With these fears reduced, and a potentially significant flair up in Syria that in the end was short lived, the markets have once again focused on the economic data. The data remains generally very strong and public pronouncements by Fed officials support market expectations of at least two more rate hikes in 2018. Equity markets have recovered and with early first quarter earnings announcements coming in quite strong, fear has receded from the market. Volatility – both in the equity market and rates market – spiked mid-quarter, but has since come back down, and in a substantial way in the case of the rates market.\n“The mortgage market suffered throughout the quarter and most agency mortgages performed far worse than comparable duration treasuries. While the fourth quarter of 2017 was a great quarter for agency RMBS, as other risk assets appeared quite rich on a relative basis and mortgages benefitted, this trend reversed in the first quarter of 2018. Going forward, prepayment fears are very benign and the resulting drop-off in the supply of new mortgages should help off-set reduced purchases by the Fed. However, as the yield curve continues to flatten, driven by progressively higher funding rates for levered mortgage investors, returns in the mortgage market are likely to remain weak.\n“The performance of the Orchid Island portfolio was consistent with what we observed in the agency mortgage market generally. Our higher coupon, fixed rate pass-throughs under-performed our hedges and led to a $0.62 decline in our book value. Orchid’s MBS portfolio has generally been positioned with a higher coupon, fixed rate bias for the past several years. With prepayment behavior exhibiting far less sensitivity to interest rate incentives than was the norm prior to the financial crisis and the damage that was done to the housing finance capacity of the market, this strategy has enabled Orchid to generate a superior income stream to our investors. Over the last two quarters the sell-off in rates and material flattening of the curve has made this strategy less viable. Accordingly, we are repositioning the portfolio to adapt to the new market environment. The current market conditions – interest rates increasing while the yield curve flattens – are likely to persist for the balance of the Fed’s tightening cycle. Going forward, we expect to maintain a lower leverage ratio and lower overall gross duration profile with the portfolio. We will continue to maintain the hedge coverage of the portfolio at a very high level – close to 100% as of March 31, 2018.”\nEarnings Conference Call Details\nAn earnings conference call and live audio webcast will be hosted Friday, April 27, 2018, at 10:00 AM ET.
