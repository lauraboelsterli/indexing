    "text": "WASHINGTON, April 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Monday rejected an Obama-era plan to make automobiles more fuel efficient in a win for car and oil companies and the latest move by the Trump administration to roll back environmental regulations.\nEPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said that agency must revise the rules, known as corporate average fuel economy, or Cafe standards, on model year 2022 to 2025 vehicles, agency spokeswoman Liz Bowman said. Pruitt did not offer any specifics on doing so. The standards called for roughly doubling by 2025 the average fuel efficiency of new vehicles sold in the United States to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon, and were seen by proponents as a way to spur innovation in clean technologies.
