    "text": "TOKYO, April 13 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average rose on Friday as suggestions from U.S. President Donald Trump that a military strike on Syria may not be imminent supported investor sentiment and higher U.S. bond yields helped financial stocks.\nThe Nikkei ended 0.6 percent higher to 21,778.74. For the week, the index added 1.0 percent, posting a third straight week of gains.\nTrump said in a tweet on Thursday that a possible attack on Syria could occur “very soon or not so soon at all,” easing fears of confrontation with Russia.\nFinancial stocks outperformed on the back of rising U.S. yields. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group surged 2.5 percent and insurer T&D Holdings soared 2.0 percent.\nElectronic components makers and chip equipment makers also gained ground, with TDK Corp jumping 3.3 percent, Advantest Corp soaring 2.1 percent and Alps Electric surging 3.7 percent.\nThe broader Topix gained 0.6 percent to 1,729.36.\nReporting by Ayai Tomisawa; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ",
