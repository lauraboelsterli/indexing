    "text": "FRANKLIN, N.C., April 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Entegra Financial Corp. (the “Company”) (NASDAQ:ENFC), the holding company for Entegra Bank (the “Bank”), today announced earnings and related data for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights\nThe following tables highlight the trends that the Company believes are most relevant to understanding the performance of the Company. As further detailed in Appendix A to this press release, core results (non-GAAP financial measures) reflect adjustments for investment gains and losses, investment impairment, and merger-related expenses.\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31, (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) 2018 2017 Change (%) GAAP Core GAAP Core GAAP Core Net income $ 3,582 $ 3,746 $ 1,300 $ 2,027 175.5 % 84.8 % Net interest income $ 12,393 N/A $ 9,618 N/A 28.9 % N/A Net interest margin 3.49 % N/A 3.30 % N/A 5.8 % N/A Return on average assets 0.90 % 0.94 % 0.39 % 0.61 % 130.8 % 54.1 % Return on average equity 9.48 % 12.18 % 3.87 % 6.28 % 145.0 % 93.9 % Efficiency ratio 66.64 % 65.18 % 80.43 % 70.16 % -17.1 % -7.1 % Diluted earnings per share $ 0.51 $ 0.53 $ 0.20 $ 0.31 155.0 % 71.0 %\nAs of March 31, As of December 31, 2018 2017 (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Asset Quality: Non-performing loans $ 4,336 $ 4,778 Real estate owned $ 2,874 $ 2,568 Non-performing assets $ 7,210 $ 7,346 Non-performing loans to total loans 0.42% 0.48% Non-performing assets to total assets 0.44% 0.46% Net charge-offs $ 80 $ 315 Allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans 257.54% 227.86% Allowance for loan losses to total loans 1.08% 1.08% Other Data: Book value per share $ 22.05 $ 22.00 Tangible book value per share $ 17.98 $ 17.90 Closing market price per share $ 29.00 $ 29.25 Closing price-to-tangible book value ratio 161.29% 163.41% Equity to assets ratio 9.34% 9.59% Tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio 7.75% 7.93% Management Commentary\nRoger D. Plemens, President and CEO of the Company, reported, “We are very pleased with our first quarter results which reflect more than a 90% increase in core return on average equity and more than a 80% increase in core net income compared to the first quarter of 2017. We continued to experience strong loan demand during the first quarter with annualized growth of 12%, while improving net interest margin 19 basis points over the first quarter of 2017 to 3.49%. We remain very focused on improving our efficiency as the organization grows and are pleased to see our core efficiency ratio improve to 65%. Moving forward, we will continue to look for opportunities to supplement our organic growth with acquisitions that provide further low cost funding.”\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income increased $2.8 million, or 28.9%, to $12.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $9.6 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher volumes in the loan portfolio as well as an increase in the yields earned on cash, investments and loans partially offset by increased costs of borrowings. Net interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2018 improved to 3.49% compared to 3.30% for the same period in 2017.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses was $0.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $0.3 million for the same period in 2017. The increased provision for loan losses in 2018 was mainly attributable to organic loan growth. The Company continues to experience modest levels of net charge-offs and non-performing loans.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income increased $0.6 million, or 52.3%, to $1.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $1.1 million for the same period in 2017 primarily as the result of the other than temporary impairment of one investment security during the three months ended March 31, 2017. Increases in mortgage banking, service charges on deposit accounts, interchange fees, and bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) were partially offset by declines in gains on sale of Small Business Association (“SBA”) loans and trading securities losses. The Company recently hired a Director of SBA Lending and expects higher levels of gains on the sale of SBA loans in future quarters.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense increased $0.8 million, or 8.7%, to $9.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $8.6 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily related to increased compensation and employee benefits, net occupancy expenses, and data processing expenses as the 2018 period included the full impact of the Chattahoochee Bank of Georgia acquisition and the branches acquired from Stearns Bank. Federal deposit insurance premiums increased for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 due to a reduction in premium credits based on certain regulatory ratios.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $0.7 million compared to $0.5 million for the comparable period in the prior year. Income tax expense for the 2018 period benefitted from the newly enacted Federal tax rate of 21% compared to a Federal tax rate of 35% in 2017. Income tax expense for the three months ending March 31, 2018 and 2017 benefited from tax-exempt income related to municipal bond investments and BOLI income resulting in effective tax rates of 17.2% and 26.9%, respectively.\nBalance Sheet\nTotal assets increased $44.0 million, or an annualized rate of 11.1%, to $1.63 billion at March 31, 2018 from $1.58 billion at December 31, 2017.\nLoans receivable increased $30.5 million, or an annualized rate of 12.0%, to $1.04 billion at March 31, 2018 from $1.00 billion at December 31, 2017. Loan growth continues to be primarily concentrated in commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans.\nCore deposits, which include wholesale deposits of $81.3 million, increased $22.8 million, or an annualized rate of 11.9%, to $788.2 million at March 31, 2018 from $765.4 million at December 31, 2017. Certificates of deposit increased $20.9 million, or an annualized rate of 21.1%, to $417.7 million at March 31, 2018 from $396.7 million at December 31, 2017. Core deposits decreased slightly from 66% of the Company’s deposit portfolio at December 31, 2017 to 65% at March 31, 2018.\nTotal shareholders’ equity increased $0.6 million to $151.9 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $151.3 million at December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to $3.6 million of net income, offset by a $3.4 million after tax decline in the market value of investment securities available for sale. Tangible book value per share, a non-GAAP measure, increased $0.08 to $17.98 at March 31, 2018 from $17.90 at December 31, 2017.\nAsset Quality\nNon-performing assets decreased $0.1 million to $7.2 million at March 31, 2018 from $7.3 million at December 31, 2017. Net loan charge-offs continue to remain modest totaling $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nStatements included in this press release include non-GAAP financial measures and should be read along with the accompanying tables in Appendix A, which provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures. This press release and the accompanying tables discuss financial measures, such as core noninterest expense, core net income, core diluted earnings per share, core return on average assets, core return on tangible average equity, core efficiency ratio, tangible common equity, tangible assets and tangible book value per share, which are all non-GAAP measures. We believe that such non-GAAP measures are useful because they enhance the ability of investors and management to evaluate and compare the Company’s operating results from period to period in a meaningful manner. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Investors should consider the Company’s performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of the Company. Non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results or financial condition as reported under GAAP.\nAbout Entegra Financial Corp. and Entegra Bank\nEntegra Financial Corp. is the holding company of Entegra Bank.
