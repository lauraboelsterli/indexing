    "text": "CLEVELAND, April 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY) today announced first quarter net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $402 million, or $.38 per common share, compared to $181 million, or $.17 per common share, for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $296 million, or $.27 per common share, for the first quarter of 2017. Key's reported results in the fourth quarter of 2017 included merger-related charges and the estimated impact of tax reform and related actions, resulting in a net impact of $.19 per common share. Key's results in the first quarter of 2017 included merger-related charges, resulting in an impact of $.05 per common share.\n\"First quarter was a good start to the year, with continuing momentum in our core businesses, as we grew and expanded relationships with our targeted clients. Revenue increased over 3% from the same period last year, driven by a higher net interest income, solid loan growth and stronger fee income. The growth in average loans this quarter was broad-based and primarily in commercial and industrial balances, which were up in excess of 3% linked quarter, as we continue to grow and expand our middle-market relationships.\nOur fee-based businesses continue to demonstrate our ability to offer a full range of solutions to our clients, including off-balance sheet financing alternatives that helped drive our investment banking and debt placement business to a record first quarter level. Expenses this quarter reflect expected seasonality, the acceleration of certain technology costs, and investments. Given our outlook for revenue growth and lower expenses for the rest of this year, we expect to make meaningful progress toward our long term efficiency ratio target of 54% to 56%.\"\n- Beth Mooney, Chairman and CEO\nSelected Financial Highlights\ndollars in millions, except per share data\nChange 1Q18 vs.\n1Q18\n4Q17\n1Q17\n4Q17\n1Q17\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders\n$\n402\n$\n181\n$\n296\n122.1\n%\n35.8\n%\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders per\ncommon share — assuming dilution\n.38\n.17\n.27\n123.5\n40.7\nReturn on average tangible common equity from continuing operations (a)\n14.89\n%\n6.35\n%\n10.98\n%\nN/A\nN/A\nReturn on average total assets from continuing operations\n1.25\n.57\n.99\nN/A\nN/A\nCommon Equity Tier 1 ratio (b)\n10.03\n10.16\n9.91\nN/A\nN/A\nBook value at period end\n$\n13.07\n$\n13.09\n$\n12.71\n(.2)\n%\n2.8\n%\nNet interest margin (TE) from continuing operations\n3.15\n%\n3.09\n%\n3.13\n%\nN/A\nN/A\n(a)\nThe table entitled \"GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations\" in the attached financial supplement presents the computations of certain financial measures related to \"Return on average tangible common equity from continuing operations.\" The table reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures, which provides a basis for period-to-period comparisons.\n(b)\n3/31/2018 ratio is estimated.\nTE = Taxable Equivalent, N/A = Not Applicable\nINCOME STATEMENT HIGHLIGHTS\nRevenue\ndollars in millions\nChange 1Q18 vs.\n1Q18\n4Q17\n1Q17\n4Q17\n1Q17\nNet interest income (TE)\n$\n952\n$\n952\n$\n929\n—\n2.5\n%\nNoninterest income\n601\n656\n577\n(8.4)\n%\n4.2\nTotal revenue\n$\n1,553\n$\n1,608\n$\n1,506\n(3.4)\n%\n3.1\n%\nTE = Taxable Equivalent\nTaxable-equivalent net interest income was $952 million for the first quarter of 2018, and the net interest margin was 3.15%, compared to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $929 million and a net interest margin of 3.13% for the first quarter of 2017, reflecting the benefit from higher interest rates and low deposit betas. First quarter 2018 net interest income included $33 million of purchase accounting accretion, a decline of $20 million from the first quarter of 2017.\nCompared to the fourth quarter of 2017, taxable-equivalent net interest income was stable, and the net interest margin increased by six basis points. Both net interest income and the net interest margin benefited from higher interest rates and Key's asset sensitive balance sheet position, as well as an expected reduction from elevated liquidity levels in the fourth quarter. These benefits were offset by two fewer days in the first quarter of 2018, a lower taxable-equivalent adjustment resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and a decline in purchase accounting accretion.\nExcluding purchase accounting accretion, taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $43 million from the first quarter of 2017 and increased $5 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNoninterest Income\ndollars in millions\nChange 1Q18 vs.\n1Q18\n4Q17\n1Q17\n4Q17\n1Q17\nTrust and investment services income\n$\n133\n$\n131\n$\n135\n1.5\n%\n(1.5)\n%\nInvestment banking and debt placement fees\n143\n200\n127\n(28.5)\n12.6\nService charges on deposit accounts\n89\n89\n87\n—\n2.3\nOperating lease income and other leasing gains\n32\n27\n23\n18.5\n39.1\nCorporate services income\n62\n56\n54\n10.7\n14.8\nCards and payments income\n62\n77\n65\n(19.5)\n(4.6)\nCorporate-owned life insurance income\n32\n37\n30\n(13.5)\n6.7\nConsumer mortgage income\n7\n7\n6\n—\n16.7\nMortgage servicing fees\n20\n17\n18\n17.6\n11.1\nOther income\n21\n15\n32\n40.0\n(34.4)\nTotal noninterest income\n$\n601\n$\n656\n$\n577\n(8.4)\n%\n4.2\n%\nN/M = Not meaningful\nKey's noninterest income was $601 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $577 million for the year-ago quarter. In the first quarter of 2018, Key benefited from investments in several fee-based businesses. The largest driver year-over-year was an increase in investment banking and debt placement fees, related to the Cain Brothers acquisition, as well as strength across the company's capital markets platform. In the first quarter of 2018, commercial mortgage banking and mergers and acquisitions advisory fees contributed to the strong performance. Operating lease income and other leasing gains also contributed to the increase, up $9 million from the year-ago period, driven by higher originations, and corporate services income grew $8 million related to higher loan and derivative trading income. These increases were partially offset by a decline in other income.\nCompared to the fourth quarter of 2017, noninterest income decreased by $55 million. The decline was largely due to seasonal impacts in several fee income categories, including investment banking and debt placement fees, cards and payments income, and corporate-owned life insurance. Investment banking and debt placement fees declined from record results in the fourth quarter of 2017, though still reported a record first quarter for the business. These declines were partially offset by increases in other income, as well as operating lease income and other leasing gains related to higher originations.\nNoninterest Expense\ndollars in millions\nChange 1Q18 vs.\n1Q18\n4Q17\n1Q17\n4Q17\n1Q17\nPersonnel expense\n$\n594\n$\n608\n$\n556\n(2.3)\n%\n6.8\n%\nNonpersonnel expense\n412\n490\n457\n(15.9)\n(9.8)\nTotal noninterest expense\n$\n1,006\n$\n1,098\n$\n1,013\n(8.4)\n(.7)\nNotable items (a)\n—\n85\n81\nN/M\nN/M\nTotal noninterest expense excluding notable items\n$\n1,006\n$\n1,013\n$\n932\n(.7)\n%\n7.9\n%\nN/M = Not meaningful\n(a)\nNotable items for the fourth quarter of 2017 includes $56 million of merger-related charges and $29 million of estimated impacts of tax reform and related actions. Notable items for the first quarter of 2017 includes $81 million of merger-related charges. See the table entitled \"GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations\" in the attached financial supplement which presents the computations of certain financial measures related to \"notable items.\"\nKey's noninterest expense was $1 billion for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $932 million, excluding notable items in the year-ago period. The year-over-year increase was primarily related to higher personnel costs, largely due to recent acquisitions, as well as accelerated technology investments and higher performance-based compensation. Higher marketing expense, operating lease expense, and intangible amortization expense drove the increase in nonpersonnel expense, but was partially offset by lower occupancy and other expense.\nNoninterest expense decreased $7 million from the fourth quarter of 2017, excluding notable items in the prior period. Personnel expense reflected seasonally high employee benefits expense, as well as the aforementioned accelerated technology investments. These increases were more than offset by lower incentive compensation compared to the prior quarter, as well as lower nonpersonnel expense related to lower business services and professional fees, a seasonal decline in marketing expense, and a continued reduction in net occupancy expense.\nBALANCE SHEET HIGHLIGHTS\nAverage Loans\ndollars in millions\nChange 1Q18 vs.\n1Q18\n4Q17\n1Q17\n4Q17\n1Q17\nCommercial and industrial (a)\n$\n42,733\n$\n41,289\n$\n40,002\n3.5\n%\n6.8\n%\nOther commercial loans\n20,705\n21,040\n22,175\n(1.6)\n(6.6)\nHome equity loans\n11,877\n12,128\n12,611\n(2.1)\n(5.8)\nOther consumer loans\n11,612\n11,549\n11,345\n.5\n2.4\nTotal loans\n$\n86,927\n$\n86,006\n$\n86,133\n1.1\n%\n.9\n%\n(a)\nCommercial and industrial average loan balances include $120 million, $119 million, and $114 million of assets from commercial credit cards at March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2017, respectively.\nAverage loans were $86.9 billion for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $794 million compared to the first quarter of 2017, reflecting broad-based growth in commercial and industrial loans with middle-market clients, as well as strength in auto lending, as the company expands into existing geographies and dealer relationships. In addition, reductions in commercial real estate loans over the past year reflect significantly higher debt placements and paydowns.\nCompared to the fourth quarter of 2017, average loans increased by $921 million, largely the result of growth in commercial and industrial loans. Key realized growth across commercial client segments, with commercial and industrial loans up 2% in the Community Bank and 5% in the Corporate Bank, unannualized.\nAverage Deposits\ndollars in millions\nChange 1Q18 vs.\n1Q18\n4Q17\n1Q17\n4Q17\n1Q17\nNon-time deposits\n$\n90,719\n$\n92,251\n$\n91,745\n(1.7)\n%\n(1.1)\n%\nCertificates of deposit ($100,000 or more)\n6,972\n6,776\n5,627\n2.9\n23.9\nOther time deposits\n4,865\n4,771\n4,706\n2.0\n3.4\nTotal deposits\n$\n102,556\n$\n103,798\n$\n102,078\n(1.2)\n%\n.5\n%\nCost of total deposits\n.36\n%\n.31\n%\n.23\n%\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A = Not Applicable\nAverage deposits totaled $102.6 billion for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $478 million compared to the year-ago quarter. Certificates of deposits and other time deposits increased $1.5 billion, reflecting strength in Key's retail banking franchise and growth from commercial relationships. Additionally, consumer noninterest-bearing balances grew 10% from the prior year. NOW and money-market deposit accounts declined $792 million, partially driven by a shift to higher-yielding deposit products and the managed exit of certain higher cost corporate and public sector deposits.\nCompared to the fourth quarter of 2018, average deposits decreased by $1.2 billion, driven by a decline in noninterest-bearing deposits, which were elevated during the fourth quarter of 2017 due to short-term escrows and seasonal deposit inflows. This decline was partially offset by growth in consumer noninterest-bearing deposits.\nASSET QUALITY\ndollars in millions\nChange 1Q18 vs.\n1Q18\n4Q17\n1Q17\n4Q17\n1Q17\nNet loan charge-offs\n$\n54\n$\n52\n$\n58\n3.8\n%\n(6.9)\n%\nNet loan charge-offs to average total loans\n.25\n%\n.24\n%\n.27\n%\nN/A\nN/A\nNonperforming loans at period end (a)\n$\n541\n$\n503\n$\n573\n7.6\n(5.6)\nNonperforming assets at period end (a)\n569\n534\n623\n6.6\n(8.7)\nAllowance for loan and lease losses\n881\n877\n870\n.5\n1.3\nAllowance for loan and lease losses to nonperforming loans (a)\n162.8\n%\n174.4\n%\n151.8\n%\nN/A\nN/A\nProvision for credit losses\n$\n61\n$\n49\n$\n63\n24.5\n%\n(3.2)\n%\n(a)\nNonperforming loan balances exclude $690 million, $738 million, and $812 million of purchased credit impaired loans at March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2017, respectively.\nN/A = Not Applicable\nKey's provision for credit losses was $61 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $63 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $49 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Key's allowance for loan and lease losses was $881 million, or 1.00% of total period-end loans, at March 31, 2018, compared to 1.01% at March 31, 2017, and 1.01% at December 31, 2017.\nNet loan charge-offs for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $54 million, or .25% of average total loans. These results compare to $58 million, or .27%, for the first quarter of 2017, and $52 million, or .24%, for the fourth quarter of 2018.\nAt March 31, 2018, Key's nonperforming loans totaled $541 million, which represented .61% of period-end portfolio loans. These results compare to .67% at March 31, 2017, and .58% at December 31, 2017. Nonperforming assets at March 31, 2018, totaled $569 million, and represented .65% of period-end portfolio loans and OREO and other nonperforming assets.

See below for further information on the Regulatory Capital Rules.\nKey's capital position remained strong in the first quarter. As shown in the preceding table, at March 31, 2018, Key's estimated Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios stood at 10.03% and 10.84%, respectively. Key's tangible common equity ratio was 8.22% at March 31, 2018.\nAs a \"standardized approach\" banking organization, Key's mandatory compliance with the final Basel III capital framework for U.S. banking organizations (the \"Regulatory Capital Rules\") began on January 1, 2015, subject to transitional provisions extending to January 1, 2019. Key's estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio as calculated under the fully phased-in Regulatory Capital Rules was 9.88% at March 31, 2018. This estimate exceeds the fully phased-in required minimum Common Equity Tier 1 and Capital Conservation Buffer of 7.00%.\nSummary of Changes in Common Shares Outstanding\nin thousands\nChange 1Q18 vs.\n1Q18\n4Q17\n1Q17\n4Q17\n1Q17\nShares outstanding at beginning of period\n1,069,084\n1,079,039\n1,079,314\n(.9)\n%\n(.9)\n%\nOpen market repurchases and return of shares under employee\ncompensation plans\n(9,399)\n(10,617)\n(8,673)\n(11.5)\n8.4\nShares issued under employee compensation plans (net of cancellations)\n5,254\n662\n6,270\n693.7\n(16.2)\nCommon Shares exchanged for Series A Preferred Stock\n—\n—\n20,568\nN/M\nN/M\nShares outstanding at end of period\n1,064,939\n1,069,084\n1,097,479\n(.4)\n%\n(3.0)\n%\nN/M = Not Meaningful\nConsistent with Key's 2017 Capital Plan, during the first quarter of 2018, Key declared a dividend of $.105 per common share, and completed $199 million of common share repurchases during the quarter.

The increase was primarily attributable to the benefit from higher interest rates and growth in loans. Average loans and leases increased $595 million, or 1.3%, largely driven by a $1.1 billion, or 6.1%, increase in commercial and industrial loans. Additionally, average deposits increased $797 million, or 1.0%, from one year ago.\nNoninterest income increased $8 million, or 2.9%, from the year-ago quarter, driven by higher assets under management from market growth, as well as increases across several fee categories.\nThe provision for credit losses increased by $2 million, or 4.3%, from the first quarter of 2017. Net loan charge-offs were flat from the first quarter of 2017, as overall credit quality was stable.\nNoninterest expense increased $43 million, or 6.9%, from the year-ago quarter. Personnel expense increased $17 million, primarily driven by recent acquisitions and ongoing investments, including residential mortgage and HelloWallet. Nonpersonnel expense increased by $26 million, driven by technology development costs, marketing expenses, higher volume-related expenses, and the impact of recent acquisitions, including HelloWallet and merchant services.\nKey Corporate Bank\ndollars in millions\nChange 1Q18 vs.\n1Q18\n4Q17\n1Q17\n4Q17\n1Q17\nSummary of operations\nNet interest income (TE)\n$\n272\n$\n284\n$\n304\n(4.2)\n%\n(10.5)\n%\nNoninterest income\n287\n321\n274\n(10.6)\n4.7\nTotal revenue (TE)\n559\n605\n578\n(7.6)\n(3.3)\nProvision for credit losses\n14\n(6)\n18\nN/M\n(22.2)\nNoninterest expense\n314\n354\n304\n(11.3)\n3.3\nIncome (loss) before income taxes (TE)\n231\n257\n256\n(10.1)\n(9.8)\nAllocated income taxes and TE adjustments\n24\n35\n76\n(31.4)\n(68.4)\nNet income (loss) attributable to Key\n$\n207\n$\n222\n$\n180\n(6.8)\n%\n15.0\n%\nAverage balances\nLoans and leases\n$\n38,260\n$\n37,460\n$\n37,688\n2.1\n%\n1.5\n%\nLoans held for sale\n1,118\n1,345\n1,097\n(16.9)\n1.9\nTotal assets\n45,549\n44,504\n44,124\n2.3\n3.2\nDeposits\n20,815\n21,558\n21,002\n(3.4)\n(.9)\nTE = Taxable Equivalent, N/M = Not Meaningful\nAdditional Key Corporate Bank Data\ndollars in millions\nChange 1Q18 vs.\n1Q18\n4Q17\n1Q17\n4Q17\n1Q17\nNoninterest income\nTrust and investment services income\n$\n29\n$\n33\n$\n37\n(12.1)\n%\n(21.6)\n%\nInvestment banking and debt placement fees\n141\n195\n124\n(27.7)\n13.7\nOperating lease income and other leasing gains\n27\n25\n21\n8.0\n28.6\nCorporate services income\n43\n40\n38\n7.5\n13.2\nService charges on deposit accounts\n13\n13\n12\n—\n8.3\nCards and payments income\n11\n10\n9\n10.0\n22.2\nPayments and services income\n67\n63\n59\n6.3\n13.6\nMortgage servicing fees\n17\n14\n16\n21.4\n6.3\nOther noninterest income\n6\n(9)\n17\nN/M\n(64.7)\nTotal noninterest income\n$\n287\n$\n321\n$\n274\n(10.6)\n%\n4.7\n%\nN/M = Not Meaningful\nKey Corporate Bank Summary of Operations (1Q18 vs. 1Q17)\nCommercial and industrial loans up $1.7 billion, or 7.9%, from prior year Investment banking and debt placement fees up $17 million, or 14%, from prior year Net income up $27 million, or 15.0%, from prior year\nKey Corporate Bank recorded net income attributable to Key of $207 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $180 million for the same period one year ago.\nTaxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $32 million, or 10.5%, compared to the first quarter of 2017, $7 million of which was related to lower purchase accounting accretion, with the remaining due to lower spreads on earning assets. Average loan and lease balances increased $572 million, or 1.5%, from the year-ago quarter, driven by growth in commercial and industrial loans. Average deposit balances decreased $187 million, or .9%, from the year-ago quarter, driven by the managed exit of higher cost corporate and public sector deposits.\nNoninterest income was up $13 million, or 4.7%, from the prior year. This increase was largely due to higher investment banking and debt placement fees, which were up $17 million, related to the acquisition of Cain Brothers, as well as continued growth in the core Key franchise. Operating lease income and other leasing gains increased $6 million due higher originations, and corporate services income increased $5 million, mostly due to higher derivatives revenue. These increases were partially offset by a decline in other noninterest income of $11 million, related to lower gains from certain real estate investments.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the provision for credit losses decreased $4 million, or 22.2%, and net loan charge-offs declined $3 million, compared to the first quarter of 2017, related to improving credit quality in the overall portfolio.\nNoninterest expense increased by $10 million, or 3.3%, from the first quarter of 2017. The increase from the prior year was largely driven by higher operating lease expense and intangible asset amortization.\nOther Segments\nOther Segments consist of Corporate Treasury, Key's Principal Investing unit, and various exit portfolios. Other Segments generated net income attributable to Key of $19 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $21 million for the same period last year.\nKeyCorp's roots trace back 190 years to Albany, New York.

For further information on the Regulatory Capital Rules, see the \"Capital\" section of this release.\n(d)\nRepresents period-end consolidated total loans and loans held for sale divided by period-end consolidated total deposits.\n(e)\nMarch 31, 2018, ratio is estimated.\n(f)\nNonperforming loan balances exclude $690 million, $738 million, and $812 million of purchased credit impaired loans at March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2017, respectively.\nGAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations\n(dollars in millions)\nThe table below presents certain non-GAAP financial measures related to \"tangible common equity,\" \"return on average tangible common equity,\" \"Common Equity Tier 1,\" \"pre-provision net revenue,\" certain financial measures excluding merger-related charges and/or other notable items, and \"cash efficiency ratio.\"\nNotable items include certain revenue or expense items that may occur in a reporting period which management does not consider indicative of ongoing financial performance. Management believes it is useful to consider certain financial metrics with and without merger-related charges and/or other notable items, including the impact of tax reform and related actions, in order to enable a better understanding of company results, increase comparability of period-to-period results, and to evaluate and forecast those results.\nThe tangible common equity ratio and the return on average tangible common equity ratio have been a focus for some investors, and management believes these ratios may assist investors in analyzing Key's capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. In October 2013, the federal banking regulators published the final Basel III capital framework for U.S. banking organizations (the \"Regulatory Capital Rules\"). The Regulatory Capital Rules require higher and better-quality capital and introduced a new capital measure, \"Common Equity Tier 1,\" a non-GAAP financial measure. The mandatory compliance date for Key as a \"standardized approach\" banking organization began on January 1, 2015, subject to transitional provisions extending to January 1, 2019.\nThe table also shows the computation for pre-provision net revenue, which is not formally defined by GAAP. Management believes that eliminating the effects of the provision for credit losses makes it easier to analyze the results by presenting them on a more comparable basis.\nAs previously disclosed, we no longer recognize merger-related charges beginning in the first quarter of 2018. Prior to that, Key recognized merger-related charges as a result of its purchase of First Niagara on August 1, 2016. The definitive agreement and plan of merger to acquire First Niagara was originally announced on October 30, 2015. As a result of this transaction, Key had recognized merger-related charges. For the first and fourth quarters of 2017, merger-related charges were included in the total for \"notable items.\" The table below shows the computation of earnings per share excluding notable items, pre-provision net revenue excluding notable items, return on average tangible common equity excluding notable items, cash efficiency ratio excluding notable items, and return on average assets from continuing operations excluding notable items. Management believes that eliminating the effects of the merger-related charges and other notable items makes it easier to analyze the results by presenting them on a more comparable basis.\nThe cash efficiency ratio is a ratio of two non-GAAP performance measures. As such, there is no directly comparable GAAP performance measure. The cash efficiency ratio performance measure removes the impact of Key's intangible asset amortization from the calculation. The table below also shows the computation for the cash efficiency ratio excluding merger-related charges. Management believes these ratios provide greater consistency and comparability between Key's results and those of its peer banks. Additionally, these ratios are used by analysts and investors as they develop earnings forecasts and peer bank analysis.\nNon-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.\nThree months ended\n3/31/2018\n12/31/2017\n3/31/2017\nTangible common equity to tangible assets at period-end\nKey shareholders' equity
