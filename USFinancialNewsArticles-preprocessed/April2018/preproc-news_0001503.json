    "text": "DELRAY BEACH, Fla., April 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PositiveID Corporation (“PositiveID” or “Company”) (OTC:PSID), a life sciences company focused on detection and diagnostics, announced today its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. The Company's Form 10- K can be found in the Investor Relations section of its website.\nFourth Quarter Financial Highlights\nRevenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased 47% to $1.4 million from revenue of $1.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Operating loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, when excluding a non-cash intangible impairment charge of $0.3 million, improved by 20% from the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Net loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 improved by 25% from the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Highlights\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased 4% to $5.4 million from revenue of $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 improved by 32% from the year ended December 31, 2016. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 improved by 33% from the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, revenues were $1.4 million, compared to $1.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The majority of the Company’s revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 came from its Mobile Labs segment, consisting of its E-N-G Mobile Systems subsidiary (“ENG”), which generated $1.4 million of revenue. Cost of revenue was $1.0 million and $0.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, due to a change in revenue mix.\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $5.4 million, compared to $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decreased revenue for 2017 compared to the prior year period was driven primarily by the timing of delivery of projects in the Mobile Labs segment, which had a large backlog of business at the time the Company acquired ENG in December 2015. Operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 improved by 32% to $4.8 million, compared to $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 improved by 33% to $8.7 million, compared to $13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nExcitePCR/Molecular Diagnostics 2017 Highlights\nFormed ExcitePCR subsidiary to better position FireflyDX for the global, point-of-care diagnostics market and provide a platform for strategic partnership and financing opportunities Announced a new product under development, the FireflyDX-Portable, a lightweight, real-time pathogen detection system with commercial availability slated for 2019 Detected Ebola virus on its lab-based FireflyDX prototype system in a collaborated effort with its assay partner, GenArraytion Inc. Continued testing and evaluation of FireflyDX for applications ranging from food safety to infectious disease detection\nENG Mobile Systems/Mobile Labs 2017 Highlights\nClosed strategic investment of $1.5 million in ENG Received a $1.2 million purchase order for mobile labs from a single customer, the largest single order received since PositiveID acquired ENG Total vehicle bookings (new contracts and purchase orders signed) up 100% over prior year Expanded service business to offer mobile maintenance and repair to help customers minimize vehicle downtime\nThermomedics/Caregiver Medical Device 2017 Highlights\nCompleted development and commenced production of a Bluetooth-enabled version of the Caregiver® thermometer, followed by an early-2018 delivery of 500 new units to a global healthcare company Expanded distribution for Caregiver with National Distribution & Contracting, Inc., and MedPro Associates Exhibited at industry conferences to increase exposure and awareness for Caregiver and generate qualified leads for its national network of distributors\n“Our businesses continued to execute in 2017, generating consistent revenues and operational improvements year over year,” said William J. Caragol, Chairman and CEO of PositiveID. “We are working diligently to ensure that our core businesses stay focused on building their top line growth with their leading-edge technologies. With the launch of our new Bluetooth-enabled Caregiver® thermometer and our continued efforts to identify and negotiate with the best strategic partner(s) for the FireflyDX product line, we remain highly focused on capitalizing on these valuable assets in 2018 and beyond.”\nPositiveID operated in three segments in 2017 and 2016: Mobile Labs, comprised of its ENG subsidiary, a specialty vehicle manufacturer; Medical Devices, comprised of its Thermomedics subsidiary, which markets the Caregiver® non-contact thermometer; and Molecular Diagnostics, consisting of its FireflyDX family of products for real-time pathogen detection at the point-of-need/point-of-care.\nPositiveID holds a significant equity interest in ENG (the Company currently owns 24% of the capital stock of ENG). On June 12, 2017, PositiveID sold 49% of its ownership in ENG, bringing its ownership to 51%. On January 30, 2018, ENG sold shares of its preferred stock, which reduced the Company’s ownership to 24% which will result in the deconsolidation of ENG effective January 30, 2018, at which time the Company will prospectively deconsolidate the balance sheet, results of operations, and cash flows of ENG in its consolidated financial statements. The terms of the transactions were disclosed in Forms 8-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAbout PositiveID Corporation\nPositiveID Corporation is a life sciences tools and diagnostics company with an extensive patent portfolio.
