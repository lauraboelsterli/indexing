    "text": "HUNTSVILLE, Ala.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ADTRAN, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADTN) reported results for the first quarter 2018. For the quarter, sales were $120.8 million compared to $170.3 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net loss was $9.1 million compared to net income of $6.7 million for the first quarter of 2017. Earnings per share, assuming dilution, were a loss of $0.19 compared to income of $0.14 for the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP earnings per share were a loss of $0.29 compared to income of $0.18 for the first quarter of 2017. GAAP earnings per share include the benefit of an acquisition-related bargain purchase gain, as well as the expense of a restructuring program. The reconciliation between GAAP earnings per share, diluted, and non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted, is in the table provided.\nADTRAN Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Tom Stanton stated, “As we expected, our performance this quarter continued to be impacted by a merger-related review and slowdown in the spending at a domestic Tier 1 customer. While our international Tier 1 revenue exceeded expectations, lower overall product volumes resulting from the domestic slowdown, coupled with restructuring expenses and lower international gross margins, negatively affected our profit margins for the quarter and further hampered our results. Looking ahead, we expect continued strength in our European business in the second quarter and a rebound in our North American business in the second half. Our level of engagement with domestic and international Tier 1 customers remains at all-time highs, and our recent acquisition of the market leadership in EPON for the North American cable/MSO market positions us for further growth moving forward.”\nThe Company also announced that its Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the first quarter of 2018. The quarterly cash dividend is $0.09 per common share to be paid to holders of record at the close of business on May 2, 2018. The ex-dividend date is May 1, 2018, and the payment date is May 16, 2018.\nThe Company confirmed that its first quarter conference call will be held Wednesday, April 18, 2018, at 9:30 a.m. Central Time.
