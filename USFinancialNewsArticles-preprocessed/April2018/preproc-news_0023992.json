    "text": "MILAN (Reuters) - Proxy adviser ISS recommended Telecom Italia ( TLIT.MI ) investors to back the list of directors proposed by activist fund Elliott at a vote expected at an April 24 meeting, claiming top investor Vivendi was a liability for the phone group.\nFILE PHOTO: A Telecom Italia tower is pictured in Rome, Italy March 22, 2016. REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini/File Photo/File Photo ISS also said Telecom Italia (TIM) shareholders should vote in favor of confirming current TIM Chief Executive Amos Genish as a board member of the former phone monopoly.\n“At this point, Vivendi appears to be more of a liability than an asset for TIM ... and Vivendi’s influence has not brought about stability,” ISS said in a report.\nReporting by Stefano Rebaudo; writing by Giulia Segreti; editing by Francesca Landini\n ",
