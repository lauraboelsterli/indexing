    "text": "EditorsNote: rewords 10th and 11th grafs\nDaniel Sedin’s goal at 2:33 of overtime gave the Vancouver Canucks a 4-3 win over the Arizona Coyotes as he and his twin brother Henrik played the final home game of their NHL careers Thursday night.\nDaniel Sedin scored the 16th overtime goal of his career after taking a pass from Henrik. The goal was Daniel Sedin’s league-record 10th overtime power-play goal.\nThe sellout crowd erupted in joy and Daniel Sedin’s teammates mobbed him after the goal culminated Vancouver’s comeback from a 3-1, second-period deficit.\nThe goal was Daniel Sedin’s second of the game. Jake Virtanen and Brendan Leipsic had Vancouver’s other goals. Henrik Sedin and Alex Edler both furnished two assists.\nChristian Fischer, Dylan Strome and Derek Stepan scored for the Coyotes.\nWith both teams eliminated from playoff contention long ago, the Sedins were the story of the game — and they did not disappoint as the contest had a playoff atmosphere. The crowd roared every time they touched the puck and during several tributes that were aired.\nFischer opened the scoring 3:44 into the game as he rushed down the left wing with the puck, cut in front of the goal and beat Vancouver goaltender Jacob Markstrom with a shot on the glove side.\nDaniel Sedin drew the Canucks even in the first minute of the middle frame as he and his brother combined with Swedish compatriot and close friend Edler on a highlight-reel goal.\nHenrik stole the puck deep in Vancouver’s end, rushed down the right wing, weaved in and out of defenders and then fed Edler as he rushed forward with him and Daniel. As Arizona goaltender Darcy Kuemper went to play a shot, Edler sent Daniel a seeing-eye backhand pass through the crease and the other twin easily scored into a gaping net.\nCoincidentally, the goal came at the 33-second mark, which matched Henrik Sedin’s jersey number. And, Daniel’s goal gave him 22 — the same number as his uniform — on the season.\nStepan staked the Coyotes to a 2-1 lead at 15:11 of the second period as he one-timed Richard Panik’s pass through Markstrom. Strome gave Arizona a two-goal advantage 61 seconds later, capitalizing on a long rebound.\nVirtanen pulled the Canucks within a goal 1:17 into the third period as he wristed home a shot from the faceoff circle after Bo Horvat won a draw. Leipsic created a 3-3 tie just under seven minutes later as he spun around Coyotes defenseman Trevor Murphy and put in a backhand.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
