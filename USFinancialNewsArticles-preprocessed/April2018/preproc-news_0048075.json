    "text": "RICHMOND, Va., April 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Markel Corporation (NYSE: MKL) reported book value per common share outstanding of $671.05 at March 31, 2018, down 2% from $683.55 at December 31, 2017. Comprehensive loss to shareholders was $174.8 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to comprehensive income of $223.2 million for the first quarter of 2017. The combined ratio was 90% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 100% for the first quarter of 2017. Diluted net loss per share was $4.25 2018 compared to diluted net income per share of $3.90 for the first quarter of 2017.\nNet loss to shareholders was unfavorably impacted by the adoption of ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities, effective January 1, 2018. As required by the new accounting standard, the Company recognized a pre-tax loss of $122.1 million ($101.3 million net of taxes) as a result of the decline in the fair value of its equity securities since December 31, 2017. Prior to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-01, changes in the fair value of the Company's equity securities were included in other comprehensive income on an after-tax basis.\nAdditionally, net loss to shareholders 2018 included a pre-tax foreign currency loss of $22.1 million ($17.5 million net of taxes) and a non-recurring tax expense of $99.5 million.\nRichard R. Whitt and Thomas S. Gayner, Co-Chief Executive Officers, commented, \"Our underwriting results for the quarter were solid and reflect profitable growth from recent acquisitions as well as our continued focus on underwriting discipline. Comprehensive loss to shareholders and book value per share were impacted by declines in both our fixed income and equity portfolios, driven by an increase in interest rates and unfavorable movements in the equity markets during the period. However, we continue to maintain a long-term focus with our investment strategy. Contributions from our Markel Ventures operations reflect both organic growth and the recent acquisition of Costa Farms.\"\nThe Company also announced today it has filed its Form 10-Q 2018 A copy of the Form 10-Q is available on the Company's website at www.markelcorp.com or on the SEC website at www.sec.gov .
