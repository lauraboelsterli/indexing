    "text": "PARIS, April 26 (Reuters) - French telecoms group Orange reported a 3.8 percent rise in its core operating profit in the first quarter, mainly driven by higher sales in its leading markets.\nAdjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose to 2.61 billion euros ($3.2 billion) over the period, in line with Reutersâ€™ average analyst estimate of 2.57 billion.\nRevenues were up by 2 percent on a comparable basis to 10.82 billion euros. The group also confirmed its full-year targets, including a higher, restated EBITDA in 2018 compared to 2017.\n$1 = 0.8212 euros Reporting by Mathieu Rosemain and Gwenaelle Barzic; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ",
