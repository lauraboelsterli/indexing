She was joined by Arantxa Rus of the Netherlands who came through a tough three-setter against Danka Kovinic.\nSlovenia’s Polona Hercog progressed to the last eight after her opponent Kateryna Bondarenko pulled out of their match due to injury. Hercog was ahead 6-2 1-1 when Ukraine’s Bondarenko retired.\nDonna Vekic overcame Australia’s Ajla Tomljanovic 6-1 6-2 and takes on Irina-Camelia Begu in the quarter-finals.
