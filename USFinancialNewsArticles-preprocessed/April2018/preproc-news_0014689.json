(together with its subsidiaries, “Athora” or the “Company”) has agreed to sell the entirety of the offshore bond portfolio of its wholly owned subsidiary, Aegon Ireland plc, to Utmost Ireland DAC, a wholly owned, Dublin-based subsidiary of Life Company Consolidation Group (“LCCG”) (the “Sale”). The offshore bond portfolio represents approximately €3 billion of assets under management for approximately 7,000 UK-based customers.

The Sale is expected to close in the final quarter of 2018, subject to regulatory approvals, and terms of the Sale were not disclosed.\n“We are pleased to have a strong purchaser in Utmost Ireland for our offshore bond portfolio and we will be working together to ensure a smooth transition for policyholders,” said Michele Bareggi, Group Managing Partner of Athora.
