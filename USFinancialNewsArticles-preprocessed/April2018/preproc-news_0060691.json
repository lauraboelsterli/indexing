    "text": "By David Meyer 7:40 AM EDT\nVan’s Foods sells a lot of waffles to people who are allergic to gluten or milk. One problem, though: more than 1,500 recently-distributed cases of Van’s Gluten Free Waffles are, in fact, full of gluten and milk.\nThe Tyson Foods (tsn) subsidiary also makes regular, gluten-tastic Homestyle Belgian Waffles, and it seems there was a mix-up in the packaging. So a recall is underway.\nAccording to the Food & Drug Administration (FDA), Van’s is voluntarily recalling 1,584 cases of gluten-free waffles that were distributed to retailers in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin.\n“People who have an allergy or severe sensitivity to milk or gluten run the risk of serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume these products,” the FDA said .\nHere’s what to look for to check whether a particular pack of Gluten Free Waffles in fact contains Belgian Waffles: a best-before date of August 22, 2018, and a product lot label reading #A640234710–WL2.\nThe FDA noted that Van’s had not yet received any reports of people having adverse reactions. However, anyone who bought the mispackaged packs should call the company on1-866-886-8456 to find out more or claim their money back. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
