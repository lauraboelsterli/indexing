    "text": "April 19, 2018 / 5:08 AM / Updated an hour ago Judge questions Trump ex-campaign chief's bid to dismiss charges Sarah N. Lynch 3 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge expressed scepticism on Thursday as a lawyer for President Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort sought to convince her to dismiss charges brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. \nDuring a hearing, U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson questioned Manafort’s attorney Kevin Downing and his reading of Department of Justice guidelines governing Mueller’s investigation involving Russia and the 2016 U.S. election. \nManafort faces two indictments accusing him of conspiracy against the United States and other crimes, both stemming from Mueller’s probe. \nHis legal team argued that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s order appointing Mueller was overly broad and violated Justice Department rules on the naming of special counsels, and that Mueller has overstepped his authority.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria \nThursday’s hearing is the latest development stemming from a special counsel investigation that could threaten Trump’s presidency. While Manafort has pleaded not guilty, Mueller has extracted guilty pleas from other former campaign figures including Manafort’s former deputy and business partner Rick Gates. \nRosenstein appointed Mueller in May 2017 to investigate whether Trump’s presidential campaign colluded with Russia and gave Mueller the power to investigate any other matters that arise from the probe. Trump and Russia have denied any collusion. \nManafort is seeking dismissal of the charges before the case can go to trial in September. The charges include conspiring to launder money and failing to register as a foreign agent in connection with his lobbying for the Ukrainian government under pro-Russian former President Viktor Yanukovych. \nThe other indictment, in Alexandria, Virginia, charges Manafort with bank fraud and filing false tax returns, among other offences. Manafort’s lawyer is set to ask for a dismissal of those charges in May before the planned July trial. Slideshow (3 Images) \nDowning previously told the court that the FBI had earlier investigated Manafort’s Ukraine business dealings and closed out the probe in 2014 without pursuing charges. \nMueller’s team has filed evidence to show he had explicit authority from Rosenstein in August 2017 to probe Manafort’s Ukraine dealings.
