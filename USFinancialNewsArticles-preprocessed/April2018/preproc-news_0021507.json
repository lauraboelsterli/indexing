Britain’s Financial Reporting Council said on Nov. 20 it had concluded a review of Mitie’s annual report and accounts for the financial year ended March 31, 2016. It also said it had launched a separate investigation in relation to the preparation and approval of the financial statements for Mitie for the year ended March 31, 2016. Mitie confirmed in a statement on the same day that this investigation was not into Mitie itself or the current management team.
