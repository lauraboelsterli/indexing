    "text": "Development of DetermaVu™ Remains on Track for Completion in 2018\n-Conference Call Today at 4:30 pm ET-\nALAMEDA, Calif., April 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OncoCyte Corporation (NYSE American:OCX), a developer of novel, non-invasive liquid biopsy tests for the early detection of cancer, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full 2017.\n“Since our last quarterly update to investors in November, the team at OncoCyte has been busy making substantial progress on several fronts,” commented William Annett, President and Chief Executive Officer. “OncoCyte has upgraded its management team, brought additional talent to its Board of Directors, strengthened its balance sheet, expanded its patent estate, and continued to advance the development of DetermaVu™ to be ready for potential commercialization by the end of 2018. So far in 2018 we have continued to be deeply engaged in a number of activities that we believe should create significant value for our shareholders over time by bringing innovative technologies to market that have the potential to save and improve the lives of cancer patients.”\nRecent Highlights\nStrengthened balance sheet through a $10 million private placement of common shares with two current investors.\nDiscovered and filed patent applications for 190 novel lung cancer biomarkers that may enhance OncoCyte’s lung cancer test and enable better differentiation of malignant from benign lung nodules for improved lung cancer diagnosis.\nReported positive data from a small study using a preliminary algorithm incorporating a combination of existing and newly discovered biomarkers. The study demonstrated at least equivalent accuracy for DetermaVu™ in diagnosing lung cancer on three different commercial molecular diagnostic platforms. These results need to be verified in a larger confirmation study to confirm the potential utility of the new biomarker panel. The Company is currently conducting that study and expects that it will be completed during the second quarter of 2018.\nAnnounced the appointment of Cavan Redmond, a director of the Company since 2015, as Chairman of the Board of Directors.\nContinued to enhance our abilities to rapidly prototype, evaluate, and develop lung cancer diagnostic products through the continued growth of our well-characterized lung cancer clinical sample bank.\nUpcoming Milestones in 2018\nFirst half:\nComplete DetermaVu™ confirmation study.\nSecond half:\nSelect final commercial platform for DetermaVu™.\nConduct R&D Validation Study of DetermaVu™\nConduct and report results of Analytical Validation Study of DetermaVu™.\nConduct CLIA Validation Study of DetermaVu™.\nConduct and report results of Clinical Validation Study of DetermaVu™.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, OncoCyte incurred a net loss of $4.0 million, or ($0.13) per share, compared to a net loss of $3.1 million, or ($0.11) per share, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOperating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017, were $3.9 million as reported, and were $3.3 million, on an as adjusted basis.\nResearch and development expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017, as reported, were $1.5 million compared to $1.4 million for the same period in 2016. The increased costs include outside laboratory and clinical trial expenses, salaries and payroll related expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, and charges to OncoCyte by its former parent company BioTime, Inc. for continued shared facilities and services provided to OncoCyte.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017, as reported, were $1.8 million compared to $1.1 million for the same period in 2016. The $0.7 million increase was mainly attributable to increased legal and patent related costs, consulting, salaries and payroll related expenses, including stock-based compensation, as we upgraded our management team with additional key hires made in 2017.\nSales and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017, as reported, were $0.6 million, relatively unchanged from $0.5 million for the same period in 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, OncoCyte had cash and cash equivalents of $7.6 million and available-for-sale securities valued at $0.8 million.\nFiscal 2017 Financial Results\nFor 2017, OncoCyte reported a net loss of $19.4 million, or ($0.64) per share, compared to $11.2 million, or ($0.42) per share, in 2016.\nOperating expenses for 2017 were $18.8 million, as reported, and were $12.6 million, on an as adjusted basis.\nResearch and development expenses for 2017, as reported, were $7.2 million, compared to $5.7 million during 2016. The $1.5 million increase was primarily due to the certification and maintenance costs related to the Company’s CLIA laboratory and the cost of the DetermaVu™ program. The increased costs include outside laboratory and clinical trial expenses, salaries and payroll related expenses, including stock-based compensation, and charges to OncoCyte by its former parent company, BioTime, Inc., for continued shared facilities and services provided to OncoCyte.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for 2017, as reported, were $9.2 million compared to $4.3 million during 2016. The $4.9 million increase was mainly attributable to a $4.1 million noncash charge for the issuance of warrants to certain investors who exercised stock purchase warrants, $0.4 million in legal and patent related expenses, $0.3 million in personnel costs and related benefits, including stock-based compensation expenses, and $0.2 million in insurance expense.\nSales and marketing expenses for 2017, as reported, were $2.4 million compared to $1.2 million during 2016. The $1.2 million increase was mainly attributable to increases of $0.7 million in salaries and payroll related expenses, including stock-based compensation, $0.2 million in consulting expenses, and $0.2 million in amounts charged to OncoCyte by BioTime for continued shared facilities and services provided to OncoCyte.\nConference Call\nOncoCyte will host a conference call today, April 2, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. ET / 1:30 p.m. PT to discuss financial results.\nThe dial-in number in the U.S./Canada is 800-281-7973, for international participants the number is 323-794-2093.

Early detection of cancer can improve health outcomes, reduce the cost of care, and improve patients’ quality of life. Liquid biopsy diagnostic tests like those OncoCyte is developing may reduce the need for costlier and riskier diagnostic procedures such as invasive biopsy and cystoscopic procedures. OncoCyte’s development pipeline is focused on non-invasive confirmatory diagnostic tests for lung, breast, and bladder cancer. OncoCyte’s tests are being developed using proprietary sets of genetic and protein molecular markers that differentially express in specific types of cancer. OncoCyte conducts ongoing research to identify additional molecular markers, acquire and license markers and related technology, and develop tests based on those markers.\nForward Looking Statements\nAny statements that are not historical fact (including, but not limited to statements that contain words such as “will,” “believes,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “estimates” and similar expressions) are forward-looking statements. These statements include those pertaining to the implementation and results of research, development, clinical trials and studies, commercialization plans, future financial and/or operating results, and future opportunities for OncoCyte, along with other statements about the future expectations, beliefs, goals, plans, or prospects expressed by management. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, risks inherent in the development and/or commercialization of potential diagnostic tests or products, uncertainty in the results of clinical trials or regulatory approvals, the capacity of our third-party supplied blood sample analytic system to provide consistent and precise analytic results on a commercial scale, the need and ability to obtain future capital, and maintenance of intellectual property rights, and the need to obtain third party reimbursement for patients’ use of any diagnostic tests we commercialize. Actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements and accordingly as such statements should be evaluated together with the many uncertainties that affect the business of OncoCyte, particularly those mentioned in the “Risk Factors” and other cautionary statements found in OncoCyte’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings. OncoCyte disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nInvestor Contacts:\nEVC Group LLC\nMatt Haines / Michael Polyviou\n917-733-9297 / 732-933-2754\nmhaines@evcgroup.com / mpolyviou@evcgroup.com\nFinancial Media Contact:\nGIBSON Communications, LLC\nTom Gibson\n201-476-0322\ntom@tomgibsoncommunications.com\nFINANCIAL TABLES FOLLOW\nONCOCYTE CORPORATION\nBALANCE SHEETS\n( In thousands )\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 ASSETS CURRENT ASSETS $ 7,600 $ 10,174 BioTime shares held as available-for-sale securities, at fair value 760 2,237 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 168 285 Total current assets 8,528 12,696 NONCURRENT ASSETS Intangible assets, net 746 988 Equipment and furniture, net 822 688 Deposits 120 75 TOTAL ASSETS $ 10,216 $ 14,447 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY CURRENT LIABILITIES Amount due to BioTime and affiliates $ 2,099 $ 2,854 Accounts payable 175 422 Accrued expenses and other current liabilities 1,042 797 Loan payable, current 800 - Capital lease liability, current 338 202 Total current liabilities 4,454 4,275 LONG-TERM LIABILITIES Loan payable, net of deferred financing costs, noncurrent 1,070 - Capital lease liability, noncurrent 289 310 TOTAL LIABILITIES 5,813 4,585 Commitments and contingencies STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Preferred stock, no par value, 5,000 shares authorized; none issued and outstanding - - Common stock, no par value, 50,000 shares authorized; 31,452 and 28,737 shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively 59,968 45,818 Accumulated other comprehensive loss on available-for-sale securities (888 ) (654 ) Accumulated deficit (54,677 ) (35,302 ) Total stockholders’ equity 4,403 9,862 TOTAL LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY $ 10,216 $ 14,447 ONCOCYTE CORPORATION\nSTATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nThree Months Ended December 31,\n(unaudited) Year Ended\nDecember 31, OPERATING EXPENSES 2017 2016 2017 2016 Research and development $ 1,507 $ 1,431 $ 7,174 $ 5,677 General and administrative 1,785 1,120 9,232 4,265 Sales and marketing 600 543 2,443 1,198 Total operating expenses 3,892 3,094 18,849 11,140 Loss from operations (3,892 ) (3,094 ) (18,849 ) (11,140 ) OTHER EXPENSES, NET Loss on sale of available-for-sale securities and other expenses, net - - (309 ) - Interest expense, net (68 ) (9 ) (217 ) (28 ) Total other expenses, net (68 ) (9 ) (526 ) (28 ) NET LOSS $ (3,960 ) $ (3,103 ) $ (19,375 ) $ (11,168 ) Basic and diluted net loss per share $ (0.13 ) $ (0.11 ) $ (0.64 ) $ (0.42 ) Weighted average shares outstanding: basic and diluted 31,440 28,712 30,195 26,529\nONCOCYTE CORPORATION\nSTATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(In thousands)\nYear Ended December 31 2017 2016 2015 CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES: Net loss $ (19,375 ) $ (11,168 ) $ (8,735 ) Adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities: Depreciation expense 338 145 41 Amortization of intangible assets 242 242 242 Stock-based compensation 1,630 922 1,815 Loss on sale of available-for-sale securities, including selling commissions 309 - - Warrants issued to certain shareholders as inducement to exercise of warrants 4,074 - - Contingently issuable warrant expense to investors - - 65 Amortization of debt issuance costs and interest expense 83 - 18 Changes in operating assets and liabilities: Amount due to BioTime and affiliates (753 ) 2,007 1,557 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 115 101 (274 ) Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (48 ) 229 1,042 Net cash used in operating activities (13,385 ) (7,522 ) (4,229 ) CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES: Net proceeds from sale of available-for-sale securities 934 - 815 Purchase of equipment (91 ) (106 ) (500 ) Security deposit - (75 ) - Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 843 (181 ) 315 CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES: Proceeds from exercise of options 610 218 4 Proceeds from exercise of warrants 7,774 - - Proceeds from sale of common stock - - 11,649 Proceeds from sale of common stock and warrants - 10,550 - Financing costs related to sale of common stock and warrants - (773 ) - Proceeds from issuance of loan payable, net of financing costs 1,982 - - Repayment of loan payable (133 ) - - Repayment of capital lease obligation (265 ) (114 ) - Net cash provided by financing activities 9,968 9,881 11,653 NET INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS (2,574 ) 2,178 7,739 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: At beginning of the year 10,174 7,996 257 At end of the year $ 7,600 $ 10,174 $ 7,996 Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis earnings release includes operating expenses prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), and includes certain historical non-GAAP operating expenses. In particular, OncoCyte has provided non-GAAP total operating expenses, adjusted to exclude noncash stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization and warrants expense issued to certain shareholders as an inducement of exercise of warrants. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. However, OncoCyte believes the presentation of non-GAAP total operating expenses, when viewed in conjunction with our GAAP total operating expenses, is helpful in understanding OncoCyte’s ongoing operating expenses and its programs.\nFurthermore, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in the aggregate to establish budgets and operational goals, to manage OncoCyte’s business and to evaluate its performance and its programs.\nOncoCyte Corporation\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measure\nAdjusted Operating Expenses\nAmounts In Thousands For the Three Months\nEnded December 31, 2017\n(unaudited) For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 GAAP Operating Expenses - as reported $ 3,892 $ 18,849 Stock-based compensation expense (472 ) (1,630 ) Noncash warrant expense - (4,074 ) Depreciation and amortization expense (162 ) (580 ) Non-GAAP Operating Expenses, as adjusted $ 3,258 $ 12,565\nSource:OncoCyte Corporation",
