    "text": "HUNTSVILLE, Texas, April 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Mitcham Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: MIND) (\"Mitcham\" or \"the Company\") today announced financial results for its fiscal 2018 fourth quarter and full year ended January 31, 2018.\nTotal revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 were $10.4 million compared to $12.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Revenues from the Marine Technology Products segment fell to $5.0 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $6.9 million in the same period last year. Revenues from the Equipment Leasing segment were $5.4 million in the fourth quarter compared to $5.7 million in the same period last year.\nThe Company reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $8.0 million, or $(0.66) per share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to a net loss of $10.0 million, or $(0.83) per share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The fourth quarter results included approximately $3.5 million of pre-tax charges, or $0.29 per share, related to impairment of goodwill, a provision for doubtful accounts, inventory adjustments and other restructuring costs. Excluding the impact of these charges, the Company reported a net loss of approximately $4.5 million, or $(0.37) per share in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nAdjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairment of intangibles, stock-based compensation, non-cash costs of lease pool equipment sales and non-cash foreign exchange gains and losses) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was a loss of approximately $1.2 million compared to a gain of approximately $2.6 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA, which is not a measure determined in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), is defined and reconciled to reported net loss and cash provided by operating activities in the accompanying financial tables.\nRob Capps, Mitcham's Co-Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"While our financial results were not what we would like them to be, we believe during fiscal 2018 and early fiscal 2019 we have made significant progress in re-positioning Mitcham as a significant provider of marine technology products. You will note that we have revised the name of our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales segment to the Marine Technology Products segment. We think this more accurately reflects the operations and focus of that part of our business.\n\"During fiscal 2018 and early 2019, we continued to expand the scale of our product offerings and increase Mitcham's footprint in the marine technology sector. In addition to these efforts, we have significantly lessened our exposure to the cyclicality of oil and gas exploration by reducing our lease pool of seismic equipment to reflect the changed business environment for our equipment leasing segment. We believe these actions have helped us to emerge from this recent downturn with solid liquidity and a clean balance sheet. Going forward, we believe that Mitcham is well positioned to benefit from increased activity in the marine technology market.\n\"Overall, our financial results for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018 improved over the fourth quarter of last fiscal year, despite the non-recurring charges discussed above. This improvement was due primarily to lower lease pool depreciation and higher gross profits on sales of lease pool equipment. Although sales of marine technology products were lower than expected during the fourth quarter and all of fiscal 2018, based on recent bookings and inquiry activity, we anticipate a stronger year for marine technology products sales in fiscal 2019. Our more optimistic outlook for this part of our business is driven in part by the anticipated impact of newly added products. As recently announced, we have added a new line of marine sensor and towed streamer products that are based on intellectual property we acquired in February. We expect to begin delivering these products and services later this fiscal year, including services to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. under the support agreement we entered into in conjunction with the acquisition of the technology.\n\"Mitcham's capital structure remains solid with no debt on our balance sheet and ample liquidity, with cash and cash equivalents of $9.9 million as of January 31, 2018. In addition, we generated positive cash flow from operating activities over the course of fiscal 2018.\"\nFISCAL 2018 FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS\nTotal revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased 17%, driven mainly by a decrease in marine technology products sales compared to last year's fourth quarter. Marine technology products sales decreased 27% year-over-year, while equipment leasing revenues, excluding lease pool equipment sales, decreased 12% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Total revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased to $10.4 million compared to $12.5 million in the same period last year.\nMarine technology products sales decreased to $5.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $6.9 million in last year's fourth quarter. The fourth quarter sales consisted of approximately $2.5 million of Seamap, $1.1 million from Klein (including $0.3 million of intra-segment sales) and $1.7 million by SAP.\nEquipment leasing revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, excluding lease pool equipment sales, were $2.1 million compared to $2.3 million in the same period last year. The year-over-year decrease in fourth quarter equipment leasing revenues was primarily driven by a reduction in exploration activity and an excess supply of equipment.\nLease pool and other equipment sales were $3.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $3.4 million in the fourth quarter a year ago.\nLease pool depreciation expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased to $2.9 million from $5.8 million in the same period a year ago, due to the reduction in the lease pool as a result of lower lease pool purchases and increased lease pool sales.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased to $5.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 versus $4.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, due primarily to restructuring costs accrued in the period.\nFISCAL 2018 RESULTS\nTotal revenues for fiscal 2018 increased 18% to $48.3 million compared to $41.0 million in fiscal 2017. Revenues for Marine Technology Products in fiscal 2018 were $27.4 million compared to $25.1 million in fiscal 2017. Equipment leasing revenues, excluding lease pool equipment sales, were $7.8 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $10.2 million a year ago. Lease pool and other equipment sales in fiscal 2018 were $13.0 million versus $5.8 million in fiscal 2017.\nGeneral and administrative expense slightly decreased to $19.7 million in fiscal 2018 from $19.8 million in fiscal 2017. The net loss available to common shareholders for fiscal 2018 was $22.0 million, or $(1.82) per share, compared to net a loss of $33.6 million, or $(2.79) per share in fiscal 2017. Adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2018 doubled to $7.2 million compared to $3.6 million in fiscal 2017.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nWe have scheduled a conference call for Wednesday, April 11 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time (8:00 a.m. Central Time) to discuss our fiscal 2018 fourth quarter and full year results.

interest expense, (b) provision for (or benefit from) income taxes and (c) depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA excludes non-cash foreign exchange gains and losses, non-cash costs of lease pool equipment sales, certain non-recurring contract settlement costs, impairment of intangible assets and stock-based compensation. We consider EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be important indicators for the performance of our business, but not measures of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). We have included these non-GAAP financial measures because management utilizes this information for assessing our performance and liquidity, and as indicators of our ability to make capital expenditures, service debt and finance working capital requirements and we believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are measurements that are commonly used by analysts and some investors in evaluating the performance and liquidity of companies such as us. In particular, we believe that it is useful to our analysts and investors to understand this relationship because it excludes transactions not related to our core cash operating activities. We believe that excluding these transactions allows investors to meaningfully trend and analyze the performance of our core cash operations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities or as alternatives to net income as indicators of operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. In evaluating our performance as measured by EBITDA, management recognizes and considers the limitations of this measurement. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our obligations for the payment of income taxes, interest expense or other obligations such as capital expenditures. Accordingly, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are only two of the measurements that management utilizes. Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nMitcham Industries, Inc.\nSegment Operating Results\n(in thousands)\n(unaudited)\nFor the Three Months Ended January 31,\nFor the Twelve Months Ended January 31,\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\n(in thousands)\n(in thousands)\nRevenues:\nMarine technology products\n$\n5,008\n$\n6,871\n$\n27,573\n$\n25,100\nEquipment leasing\n5,373\n5,739\n20,919\n15,961\nInter-segment sales\n(18)\n(62)\n(216)\n(62)\nTotal revenues\n10,363\n12,548\n48,276\n40,999\nCost of sales:\nMarine technology products\n3,728\n3,551\n16,844\n13,612\nEquipment leasing\n5,282\n11,729\n25,563\n34,863\nInter-segment costs\n(18)\n(63)\n(215)\n(62)\nTotal cost of sales\n8,992\n15,217\n42,192\n48,413\nGross profit (loss)\n1,371\n(2,669)\n6,084\n(7,414)\nOperating expenses:\nSelling, general and administrative\n5,155\n4,593\n19,663\n19,753\nResearch and development\n865\n356\n1,502\n974\nProvision for doubtful accounts\n1,013\n750\n1,013\n750\nImpairment of intangible assets\n1,466\nâ€”\n1,466\nâ€”\nDepreciation and amortization\n526\n542\n2,148\n2,399\nTotal operating expenses\n9,025\n6,241\n25,792\n23,876\nOperating loss\n$\n(7,654)\n$\n(8,910)\n$\n(19,708)\n$\n(31,290)\nMarine Technology Products Segment:\nRevenues:\nSeamap\n$\n2,474\n$\n4,423\n$\n18,527\n$\n14,085\nKlein\n1,146\n1,745\n4,602\n8,207\nSAP\n1,669\n1,533\n5,667\n4,786\nIntra-segment sales\n(281)\n(830)\n(1,223)\n(1,978)\n5,008\n6,871\n27,573\n25,100\nCost of sales:\nSeamap\n1,580\n1,605\n10,018\n6,106\nKlein\n1,061\n1,377\n3,632\n5,707\nSAP\n1,355\n1,232\n4,513\n3,668\nIntra-segment sales\n(268)\n(663)\n(1,319)\n(1,869)\n3,728\n3,551\n16,844\n13,612\nGross profit\n$\n1,280\n$\n3,320\n$\n10,729\n$\n11,488\nGross profit margin\n26\n%\n48\n%\n39\n%\n46\n%\nEquipment Leasing Segment:\nRevenue:\nEquipment leasing\n$\n2,060\n$\n2,342\n$\n7,826\n$\n10,161\nLease pool equipment sales\n3,089\n3,075\n12,478\n5,332\nOther equipment sales\n224\n322\n615\n468\n5,373\n5,739\n20,919\n15,961\nCost of sales:\nDirect costs-equipment leasing\n1,088\n1,008\n3,450\n3,284\nLease pool depreciation\n2,861\n5,777\n14,370\n25,753\nCost of lease pool equipment sales\n1,263\n4,865\n7,571\n5,629\nCost of other equipment sales\n70\n79\n172\n197\n5,282\n11,729\n25,563\n34,863\nGross profit (loss)\n$\n91\n$\n(5,990)\n$\n(4,644)\n$\n(18,902)\nContacts:\nRob Capps, Co-CEO\nMitcham Industries, Inc.\n936-291-2277\nJack Lascar / Mark Roberson\nDennard Lascar Investor Relations\n713-529-6600\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mitcham-industries-reports-fiscal-2018-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-results-300627627.html\nSOURCE Mitcham Industries, Inc.",
