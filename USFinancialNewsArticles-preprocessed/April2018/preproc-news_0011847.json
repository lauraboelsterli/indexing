    "text": "India South Korean court finds ousted Park guilty of bribery The court ruled that Park colluded with her old friend, Choi Soon-sil, to receive tens of billions of won from major conglomerates such as Samsung and Lotte. Published 11 Hours Ago Reuters Jeon Heon-Kyun | Getty Images South Korean President Park Geun-Hye makes a speech during an address to the nation, at the presidential Blue House in Seoul on November 29, 2016. \nA South Korean court found former President Park Geun-hye guilty of bribery on Friday over a scandal that exposed webs of corruption between political leaders and the country's conglomerates. \nThe court ruled that Park colluded with her old friend, Choi Soon-sil, to receive tens of billions of won from major conglomerates such as Samsung and Lotte to help Choi's family and fund non-profit foundations owned by her. \nPark, 66, has denied wrongdoing and was not present in court. \nProsecutors are seeking a 30-year sentence and a 118.5 billion won ($112 million) fine for Park, after indicting her on charges that included bribery, abuse of power and coercion.
