    "text": "NAMPA, Idaho, April 18, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Viable Solutions of Nampa, ID has initiated a recall of certain Kratom-containing powder products, because it has the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.\nThe potentially affected powder products are packaged in kaft paper, foil-lined heat sealed pouches and sold in 25 grams, 100 grams, 250 grams, and 1000 grams sizes. The units were sold directly to consumers nationwide in January and February of 2018 via company websites. The products description are as follows:\nRecall Product Identification:\nBrand\nProduct Name\nNet Wt.\nHerbal-Salvation.com\nMitragyna Speciosa Leaf\nPowder-Red Vein Sumatra\n25 grams, 100 grams, 250\ngrams, 1000 grams\nHerbal-Salvation.com\nMitragyna Speciosa Leaf\nPowder-Red Vein Bali\n25 grams, 100 grams, 250\ngrams, 1000 grams\nHerbal-Salvation.com\nMitragyna Speciosa Leaf\nPowder-Green Horn\n25 grams, 100 grams, 250\ngrams, 1000 grams\nHerbal-Salvation.com\nMitragyna Speciosa Leaf\nPowder-Thai Maeng Da\n25 grams, 100 grams, 250\ngrams, 1000 grams\nThe lot numbers being recalled can be found on the packaging and are as follows:\nRecalled Products have any of the following LOT Numbers\nRVS1380182301\nRVB1380182201\nGVH1380171512\nMD13120181601\nThe company has been notified by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) that certain lots of the product were tested positive for Salmonella. While the Salmonella has not been traced to Viable Solutions, out of an abundance of caution and concern for the public health, Viable Solutions has initiated this recall. Viable Solutions has identified the supplier and source of the potentially contaminated product and has ceased production and distribution of the potentially contaminated product. Working in cooperation with the FDA, the company will destroy all recalled product upon return.\nConsumers who may be in possession of potentially contaminated products are advised not to consume products from those LOT numbers. All products associated with this recall should be returned to Viable Solutions for a full refund. Customers can return product to company for a full refund within fourteen (14) days by contacting Viable Solutions at recall@herbal-salvation.com .\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/viable-solutions-llc-recalls-certain-kratom-containing-powder-products-because-of-possible-health-risk-300632377.html\nSOURCE Viable Solutions, LLC",
