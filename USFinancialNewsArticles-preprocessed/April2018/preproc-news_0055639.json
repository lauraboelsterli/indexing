I won’t be relaxing until we are mathematically safe.”\nThe Football Association (FA) have held talks to sell Wembley Stadium, the home of the England national team, to U.S. billionaire Shahid Khan in a deal that British media said could be worth up to 1 billion pounds.\nThe deal could force England to play away from Wembley but Hodgson, who managed the national team between 2012 and 2016, has backed the FA’s decision.\n“I think that if the FA have made a deal, it will be for the right reasons,” Hodgson added. “And that money would be spent in the right way to help our football in England.\n“I enjoyed Wembley like managers before me and I would be disappointed if that was the end of England at Wembley, but I don’t think that will be the case. If a couple of games are taken around the country, I don’t see that as a negative.”\nHodgson said striker Connor Wickham has returned to training having been out since rupturing his cruciate ligament against Swansea City in November 2016.
