    "text": "24 COMMENTS There’s an epidemic among the top picks in Thursday’s NFL draft. More than half of them have been discovered with chips on their shoulders.\nOne is boulder-sized. Others have them on both shoulders. Some are growing. Chips on shoulders are all over the place.\nBaker Mayfield, the No. 1 overall pick, famously has a chip on his shoulder. So do fellow quarterbacks Josh Allen, Josh Rosen and Lamar Jackson.\nChips on shoulders are rampant among the 32 players who have now been declared the best available, and are set to earn millions in paychecks. A Wall Street Journal analysis discovered at least 18 of the 32 first round picks has at one time or another been driven by a chip on the shoulder.\nThe exact mechanics of the chip remain unclear. Chips, including their size, are not one of the official measurements at the annual combine. But generally NFL teams believe a good chip speeds up a player’s motor. It is undetermined how many players have been installed with motors.\nIn particular, the five quarterbacks taken in the first round of Thursday’s NFL draft have wasted no time trying to one up themselves about how slighted they feel. Mayfield was taken No. 1 overall by the Cleveland Browns after proclaiming this spring: “It’s not even a chip …I’d say it’s a boulder.”\nMayfield always felt justified to say he had a chip on his shoulder. He had to walk on at Texas Tech, and then at Oklahoma—where he won the Heisman Trophy. Now he’ll have to work extra hard to maintain his claim to a chip after the validation of being proclaimed the best player available in the entire draft.\nLamar Jackson, who went last in the round and fifth among the quarterbacks to the Baltimore Ravens, one-upped the shoulder talk late last night: “There’s a chip on my shoulder. Both shoulders.”\nJosh Rosen, the 10th pick to the Arizona Cardinals and fourth quarterback off the board, declared there were nine “mistakes” made in front of him, adding his “chip’s only growing bigger.”\nJosh Rosen of UCLA reacts after being picked #10 overall by the Arizona Cardinals during the first round of the 2018 NFL Draft at AT&T Stadium on April 26, 2018 in Arlington, Texas. Photo: Ronald Martinez/Getty Images And Josh Allen, who went seventh to the Buffalo Bills after being ignored by schools out of high school, had already declared “I’m always going to have the same chip on my shoulder.”\nOnly the Jets—of course, only the Jets—picked a quarterback, Sam Darnold, who declared definitively that he does not have a chip on his shoulder, even after Mayfield got picked first. (He pointed to the way his parents raised him, so good luck New York.)\nSeven of the first ten picks were carrying the weight, including Roquan Smith, a linebacker drafted by the Chicago Bears who apparently has a “perennial” chip, the most aggressive kind. The Dallas Cowboys drafted Leighton Vander Esch, a linebacker, because they apparently believe Boise State produces good chips.\nHayden Hurst, the first tight end taken, at No. 25 by the Ravens, maybe had to ditch his chip after saying he’d pick one up if he would slip out of the first round. But, in case of emergency, he may be able to borrow one from his new teammate Jackson.\nWrite to David Benoit at david.benoit@wsj.com and Andrew Beaton at andrew.beaton@wsj.com",
