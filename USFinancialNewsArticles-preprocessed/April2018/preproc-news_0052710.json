    "text": "JERUSALEM, April 26 (Reuters) - Three directors are stepping down from the board at Teva Pharmaceutical Industries and only one new director is being nominated to replace them, the generic drugmaker said on Thursday.\nRonit Satchi-Fainaro, a Tel Aviv University professor who heads the Cancer Research and Nanomedicine Laboratory, will be the only new nominee at a June 5 shareholders meeting, the company said in a statement.\nCurrent directors Galia Maor, Gabrielle Sulzberger and Dan Suesskind will not submit their candidacy for reelection. This will leave the board with 11 members, down from the current 13.\nTeva, the worldâ€™s largest generic drugmaker, is in the midst of a structural overhaul to help deal with its massive debt.
