    "text": "2 COMMENTS The Serious Fraud Office confirmed it is investigating. Photo: SERIOUS FRAUD OFFICE \nThe U.K’s Serious Fraud Office launched a criminal investigation of potential corruption at Ultra Electronics Holdings PLC in connection with its activities in Algeria, the defense contractor said Thursday.\nThe investigation is looking at “suspected corruption in the conduct of business in Algeria by Ultra, its subsidiaries, employees and associated person,” said the company. Ultra Electronics said it alerted the regulator to the potential wrongdoing and continues to cooperate.\nThe SFO confirmed it is investigating but said it couldn’t provide more information because the inquiry “is live.”\nAn Ultra Electronics spokeswoman said the company received about £400,000 ($568,000) of revenue from contracts, obtained via third-party representatives, to provide non-defense services in Algeria last year. The spokeswoman said she couldn’t say whether the inquiry is connected to those sales.\nTotal revenue for 2017 was £775.4 million, according to the company’s annual report. It is active in defense, aerospace and transport, among other areas.\nUltra Electronics’ stock was down 7.1% Thursday afternoon in London, trading at £1.29.\nWrite to Henry Cutter at henry.cutter@wsj.com.
