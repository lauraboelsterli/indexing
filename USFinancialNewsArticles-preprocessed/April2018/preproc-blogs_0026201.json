    "text": "April 13, 2018 / 6:11 AM / Updated 26 minutes ago Yahoo Japan to buy minority stake in cryptocurrency exchange Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nTOKYO (Reuters) - Yahoo Japan Corp ( 4689.T ) said on Friday it would buy a minority stake in a Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange, becoming the latest major Japanese financial services provider to shrug off security concerns and join the digital money industry. FILE PHOTO: A website of Yahoo Japan Corp is seen on a computer screen in Tokyo August 19, 2009. REUTERS/Stringer \nYahoo Japan, which is also the countryâ€™s biggest online auction site, said in a statement it would buy through a subsidiary a 40 percent stake in BitARG Exchange Tokyo, with services planned for launch in the autumn. \nYahoo Japan did not give details of the value of the investment. But a person familiar with the matter said it would likely total 2 billion to 3 billion yen ($18.6 million to $27.9 million). \nShares in Yahoo Japan closed down 0.2 percent, against a 0.6 gain for the benchmark Nikkei average .N225 . \nThe deal comes after Japanese online brokerage firm Monex Group Inc ( 8698.T ) said last week it would buy hacked cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck Inc for $34 million. \nThat saw Monex join other mainstream financial services providers such as larger peer SBI Holdings Inc ( 8473.T ) and messaging app operator Line Corp ( 3938.T ) in looking to enter the cryptocurrency industry.
