(NASDAQ: AFH) (“Atlas” or the “Company”) today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nManagement Comments\nScott D. Wollney, Atlas’ President and CEO, stated, “While we are disappointed that book value was reduced by reserve strengthening related to prior periods, we are reassured that results for more recent accident years are coming in as expected. The significant commitment made to analytics and technology are amplifying the experience, data and heritage we have always identified as valuable assets of our insurance subsidiaries. The majority of our case reserves are now based on predictive modeling, and thus far this model has proved to be working, helping us to bring claims to ultimate faster and with greater accuracy. We believe the file by file review conducted by our experienced team will also serve as a reliable benchmark against which future payments for older claims can be measured. Going forward, we plan to share quarterly actual loss development experience for both the audited claim files for older accident years as well as paid to case reserve outcomes for predictive model based case reserves.”\nFinancial and Operational Review\nPremiums Written: For the three month period ended December 31, 2017, gross premiums written was $54.2 million compared to $52.0 million for the three month period ended December 31, 2016, representing an 4.3% increase. Gross premiums written increased primarily due to growth in livery/limousine in California and New Jersey, para-transit in Texas, and taxi in Pennsylvania, partially offset by decreases in para-transit in New Jersey and New York, taxi in Louisiana, and in all lines in Minnesota and Michigan.\nGeographic Distribution: The Company is licensed in 49 states and the District of Columbia. Atlas actively writes its core business in 42 of these states plus the District of Columbia. Compared to the three month period ended December 31, 2016, Atlas experienced growth in gross premiums written in its core business in 22 states for the three month period ended December 31, 2017. Based on the Company’s commitment to optimize return on deployed capital, the Company utilizes predictive analytics based pricing coupled with its strong value proposition to grow market share in environments that are favorable and is prepared to reduce exposure to those that are more challenging.\nCombined Ratio: Atlas’ combined ratio increased for the three month period ended December 31, 2017 to 220.3%, compared to 156.5% in the prior year period.\nLoss Ratio: The loss ratio relating to claims incurred for the three month period ended December 31, 2017 was 189.5%, compared to 135.7% for the three month period ended December 31, 2016. The loss ratio increased 57.4% for the three month period ended December 31, 2017 primarily as a result of the Company’s re-estimation of its unpaid claims liabilities on prior accident years. As previously announced, the Company is utilizing machine learning based predictive analytics in the claim area, in addition to using it as an underwriting tool, to further benefit from the data and experience within its organization. Atlas believes this approach amplifies the value of the assets accumulated over its operating subsidiaries’ many years spent focusing on niche target markets to model potential risk and deliver value for both customers and stakeholders. On a year over year basis, the Company expects its loss ratio to continue to generally trend in a positive direction based on prior year and potential future pricing, underwriting and claims activities. Underwriting Expense Ratio: The underwriting expense ratio for the three month period ended December 31, 2017 was 30.8% compared to 20.8% for the three month period ended December 31, 2016. The ratio increased mainly because expenses recovered related to stock purchase agreements had lowered the fourth quarter 2016 ratio by 9.0%, higher than average acquisition costs in the quarter and an increase in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (“DPAC”). As previously indicated, due to seasonality and the timing of certain expenses, the Company believes the full year expense ratio is a more indicative measure of efficiency that the ratio in any given quarter. Atlas’ underwriting expense ratio for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2017, excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses and expenses related to stock purchase agreements, was 27.5%. Atlas remains focused on continually enhancing its value proposition through re-investment into research and development to ensure that its organization is able to continue leading the industry in terms of existing and developing niche markets on which Atlas focuses.\nThe table below details the comparisons of each component of the Company’s combined ratio for the periods indicated (after accounting for the effect of quota share reinsurance):\nThree Month Periods Ended Year Ended December 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nLoss Ratio: Current accident year 59.2 % 62.8 % 59.5 % 59.7 % Prior accident years 130.3 % 72.9 % 35.0 % 19.1 % Loss Ratio 189.5 % 135.7 % 94.5 % 78.8 % Underwriting Expense Ratio: Acquisition cost ratio 14.5 % 13.0 % 12.9 % 11.0 % Other underwriting expense ratio 15.2 % 15.9 % 14.2 % 16.3 % DPAC amortization ratio 0.6 % — % 0.4 % (0.4 ) % Underwriting expense ratio before expenses related to\nstock purchase agreements and share-based compensation expenses\n30.3 % 28.9 % 27.5 % 26.9 % Expenses recovered related to stock purchase agreement ratio — % (9.0 ) % — % (3.7 ) % Share-based compensation expense ratio 0.5 % 0.9 % 0.5 % 0.9 % Underwriting expense ratio 30.8 % 20.8 % 28.0 % 24.1 % Total combined ratio 220.3 % 156.5 % 122.5 % 102.9 % As the Company continues the use of quota share reinsurance, and potentially changes the percentage of ceded premiums under its contract, the impact on the individual ratios of acquisition cost and other underwriting expense will vary. On a pro-forma basis, as if there was no quota share reinsurance in place, the components of the underwriting expense ratio for the periods indicated would have been as follows:\nThree Month Periods Ended Year Ended December 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nAcquisition costs 16.6 % 16.8 %\n15.4 %\n15.1 %\nOther insurance general and administrative expenses 13.7 % 13.6 %\n12.7 % 13.7 %\nDPAC amortization 0.6 % — %\n0.3 % (0.4 )% Expenses recovered related to stock purchase agreements — % (7.7 )% — % (3.1 )% Share-based compensation expense 0.4 % 0.7 %\n0.5 % 0.8 %\nTotal underwriting expense ratio 31.3 % 23.4 %\n28.9 % 26.1 %\nUnderwriting Results: Underwriting loss increased to $69.1 million for the three month period ended December 31, 2017, compared to an underwriting loss of $25.0 million in the same period of the prior year.\nNet Loss before Income Taxes: Net loss before income taxes increased to $68.0 million for the three month period ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net loss before income taxes of $23.2 million in the same period of the prior year.\nIncome Taxes: Atlas recognized tax benefit of $13.7 million for the three month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to a tax benefit of $9.7 million in the same period of the prior year.\nNet Loss: Atlas reported net loss of $54.3 million for the three month period ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net loss of $13.6 million for the three month period ended December 31, 2016.\nLoss per common share (“EPS”): Atlas generated $4.48 loss per common share diluted for the three month period ended December 31, 2017. This compares to a loss of $1.13 per common share diluted as reported for the three month period ended December 31, 2016.\nShare Count: The following chart illustrates Atlas’ potential dilutive common shares for the three month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nThree Month Periods Ended December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Weighted average common shares outstanding 12,122,334 12,045,519 Dilutive average common shares outstanding 12,122,334 12,045,519 The effects of convertible instruments are excluded from the computation of earnings per common share diluted in periods in which the effect would be anti-dilutive. For the three month periods ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, all exercisable stock options were deemed to be anti-dilutive.\nBalance Sheet/Investment Overview\nBook Value: Book value per common share was $7.42 based on 12,178,857 common shares outstanding as of December 31, 2017, compared to $10.54 based on 12,045,519 common shares outstanding as of December 31, 2016. Book value per common share of $7.42 decreased by $3.12 relative to December 31, 2016 as follows:\n$(2.35) decrease related to net income after tax and before items indicated below;\n$(0.87) decrease related to the change in the statutory tax rate due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017;\n$0.05 increase related to the change in net realized investment gains after tax;\n$0.02 increase related to the change in unrealized gains/losses after tax; and\n$0.03 increase related to share-based compensation.\n$(3.12) total decrease from December 31, 2016 book value per common share\nCash and Invested Assets: Cash and invested assets as of December 31, 2017 totaled $243.5 million as compared to $224.8 million as of December 31, 2016.\nInvestment Strategy: Atlas aligns its securities portfolio to support the liabilities and operating cash needs of its insurance subsidiaries, to preserve capital and to generate investment returns. Atlas invests predominantly in fixed income securities with overall maturities that correlate with the payout patterns of Atlas’ claims liabilities and other liquidity needs. Other than fixed income investments are limited to an appropriately small percentage of its portfolio and are generally opportunities identified through the Company’s specialty focus or by leveraging the resources of its business partners. As of December 31, 2017, the average life on the Company’s portfolio was 4.9 years with a duration of 3.9 years. The Company’s investment allocations will be regularly reviewed based on market conditions with a continued emphasis on capital preservation to support growth in its operating business.\nInvestment Income / Yield: Atlas generated net investment income of $1.6 million and $1.7 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, as well as $128,000 of realized loss and $206,000 of realized gains, respectively. The decrease in investment income from the prior year period was primarily the result of lower returns on equity method investments, partially offset by higher interest income on the Company’s fixed income securities portfolio. The decrease in net realized gains was the result of net realized losses from equity method investments, partially offset by net realized gains from equity securities. The gross annualized investment yield on the Company’s fixed income securities was 2.4% and 2.2% for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The gross annualized investment yield on the Company’s cash and cash equivalents was 0.3% and 0.1% for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in gross yield on cash investments was due to higher interest rates on certain new accounts and higher balances in accounts earning greater interest.\nOutlook for 2018\nAtlas expects to write in excess of $300 million in premiums in 2018, which is a consistent rate of growth relative to last year, subject to market conditions. Based on recent commercial auto industry results, the Company expects further market hardening through 2018. As always, underwriting profit will take precedent over top line growth.\nAt that level of premium and expected use of the Company’s existing reinsurance programs, with a combined ratio in the mid-80s, it is reasonable to expect annual net earnings per share to exceed $2.00.\nConference Call Details\nDate/Time: Tuesday, April 3, 2018 - 8:30 a.m. ET Participant Dial-In Numbers: (United States): 877-423-9817 (International): 201-493-6770 To access the call, please dial-in approximately five minutes before the start time and, when asked, provide the operator with passcode “Atlas”.\nAn accompanying slide presentation will be available in .pdf format on the investor relations page of the Company’s website after issuance of the earnings release.\nWebcast\nThe call will also be simultaneously webcast over the Internet via the “Investor Relations” section of Atlas’ website at www.atlas-fin.com/investorrelations or by clicking on the conference call link: http://atlas-fin.equisolvewebcast.com/q4-2017 .
