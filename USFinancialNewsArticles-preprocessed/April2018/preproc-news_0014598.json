    "text": "BUDAPEST, April 8 (Reuters) - Hungary ruling Fidesz party is unlikely to win a two-thirds parliamentary majority, Fidesz’s parliamentary group leader Gergely Gulyas told private broadcaster ATV after Sunday’s election produced a higher-than-expected turnout.\n“Theoretically everything is still possible as we don’t know the data yet ... but in Hungary a two-thirds victory is possible if neither side loses more than 10 districts and there is a difference of at least 20 percent between the winner and the runner-up,” Gulyas said.\n“I consider this unlikely. I think this is outside the category of reality.” (Reporting by Gergely Szakacs and Krisztina Than. Editing by Jane Merriman)\n ",
