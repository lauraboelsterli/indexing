    "text": "April 5, 2018 / 6:30 AM / Updated 7 hours ago Morgan hopes ball-tampering bans will restore cricket's image Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - England’s limited-overs captain Eoin Morgan believes cricket’s reputation has been “battered” by the recent ball-  Cape Town but hopes the sanctions imposed on the Australian trio could help the game move on from the episode. Cricket - ODI - New Zealand vs England - Hagley Park, Christchurch, New Zealand, March 10, 2018. England’s captain Eoin Morgan holds the trophy after winning the one-day international series against New Zealand. REUTERS/Ross Setford. \nCricket Australia handed 12-month bans to former captain Steve Smith and his deputy David Warner, while Bancroft was suspended for nine months after he was caught using a piece of sandpaper on the ball in the third test against South Africa. \nMorgan said the severity of the punishment has sent a firm message to the players that such tactics against the spirit of the game will not be tolerated. \n“In the last two weeks cricket has been battered and not for the right reasons,” he told reporters. \n“I’d like to think that the balance changed when the sanctions were imposed, because they were serious sanctions. You can see it and say it’s wrong but to then back it up with such a sanction says a huge amount.” \nSmith and Bancroft were also barred from holding leadership positions within the Australian team for two years, while Warner will never be able to hold such a position again. \nMorgan accepts there are some “grey areas” around the issue of ball-tampering but Cricket Australia’s actions have made it clear that none of methods to scuff up the ball are acceptable. \n“Throwing the ball in, one bounce, is fine... but if you throw to the keeper from long-on or long-off, the umpires will monitor how often the ball hits the playing surface and tell you they’ll change the ball if you do it again,” he added. \n“So, yes, there are grey areas but I think Cricket Australia have gone a long way to saying none of it is acceptable.” Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru",
