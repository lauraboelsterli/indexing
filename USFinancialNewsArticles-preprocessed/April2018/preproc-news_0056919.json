There are factors to consider on the hawkish side such as lending appetite by banks which has picked up.”\nA key market gauge of long-term euro zone inflation expectations on Wednesday hit a 7-week high just around 1.71 percent, showing that investors’ views on the inflation outlook have changed since the ECB’s last meeting.\nWith the bond-buying scheme due to expire in September, the ECB will have to decide in June or July whether to extend purchases or wind them down. And with the risk of a global trade war still looming, it may not decide until absolutely necessary, so retaining the flexibility to adjust policy.\nMoney-market pricing suggests that investors expect the ECB to deliver its first hike in this economic cycle by June 2019, having pushed back expectations from early next year. tmsnrt.rs/2HKfMx2\nEuro zone bond yields fell 1-2 basis points in early trade as U.S. bond yields pulled back from multi-year highs.\nGermany’s benchmark 10-year bond yield fell 2 bps to 0.617 percent, after reaching a six-week high of 0.655 percent on Tuesday.\nEuro zone debt yields have been dragged up this week by a rise in U.S yields. The yield on the U.S 10-year Treasury jumped to a four-year peak of 3.035 percent on Wednesday, its highest since January 2014 US10YT-=RR.\nThe Treasury yield has climbed on expectations of a steady U.S. economic expansion, accelerating inflation and concerns about increasing debt supply. It last stood at 3.031 percent.\nReporting by Fanny Potkin and Dhara Ranasinghe; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ",
