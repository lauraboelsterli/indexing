    "text": "The much-anticipated Supreme Court case US v. Microsoft — which could have decided the extent of American jurisdiction over foreign servers — is now, for all intents and purposes, dead. On March 30th, the Department of Justice moved to drop the lawsuit as moot, and today, Microsoft filed to agree with the motion . While the Supreme Court has yet to officially drop the case, it's a foregone conclusion that they will.\nBoth the government and Microsoft agree that the newly passed CLOUD Act renders the lawsuit meaningless. In US v. Microsoft , federal law enforcement clashed with Microsoft over the validity of a Stored Communications Act warrant for data stored on a server in Dublin. The CLOUD Act creates clear new procedures for procuring legal orders for data in these kinds of cross-border situations. In last week's motion to vacate, DOJ disclosed that it had procured a new warrant under the CLOUD Act.\nAlthough the new law is not without controversy , Microsoft supported the CLOUD Act while it was still a bill and again took the opportunity praise it in its Supreme Court filing, calling it a \" nuanced legislative scheme that creates a modern legal framework for law-enforcement access to data across borders. \"\nRead more from The Verge: \nMajor blockchain group says Europe should exempt Bitcoin from new data privacy rule \nWhy AI isn't going to solve Facebook's fake news problem \nMophie's new $60 charger fixes some problems from the original, but it is still too expensive",
