We will have to see how the negotiations go,” Sorenson told Reuters on the sidelines of a press conference in Bengaluru.\nMarriott will be renegotiating contracts with major online bookers for the first time since its merger with Starwood Hotels in September 2016 and the lower commissions could likely boost Marriott’s revenue per room, but may hurt the travel agents.\nExpedia’s would be the first major renewal with the current deal expiring later this year. The company will renegotiate its contract with Booking Holdings Inc sometime in 2019.\nThe Marriott chief was in India’s global outsourcing capital Bengaluru to open the company’s 100th hotel in the country, the Sheraton Grand Bengaluru Whitefield.\nMarriott currently pays a commission of upwards of 10 percent to online travel agencies, which currently contribute about 12 percent to Marriott’s overall bookings.\nThe bulk of company’s bookings come from direct channels, including its mobile application and website.\n“We have seen significant growth in all digital channels...What has declined a bit would be travel agents, in part because people are moving online and doing things themselves,” Sorenson said.\nThe world’s biggest hotel chain is benefiting from strong economic growth in Asia Pacific region, led by China.\nSorenson said that Marriott’s partnership with ecommerce company Alibaba had driven a “few million” new members to sign up for its loyalty programs in China since the deal was inked in 2017.\nMarriott generates roughly 55 percent of its business from loyalty members.\nThe company said on Tuesday it plans to expand its presence in India where it has more than 50 signed projects in its pipeline.\nThe Bethesda, Maryland-based company expects to introduce three new brands, namely Moxy, Delta and Tribute in the coming few years in India, which is its second biggest market in Asia after China.\nThe growth in India would raise its room inventory to more than 30,000 units, up from about 22,000 currently, Marriott said without providing a timeline.\nExpedia’s shares were down nearly 1 pct at $106 in late afternoon trading on Tuesday.
