    "text": "LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pacific Commerce Bancorp (OTC Pink: PCBC) (the “Company”), parent company of Pacific Commerce Bank (the “Bank”), today reported results for the first quarter ending March 31, 2018. On February 26, 2018, the Company announced that it entered into a merger agreement with First Choice Bank (OTCQX: FCBP). The transaction is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nCore net income (adjusting for a total of $242,000 tax effected merger related expenses incurred in Q1-2018 and the DTA impairment charge of $930,000 in Q4-2017), increased 23.65% in the quarter to $1.69 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, from $1.37 million, or $0.15 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017. Core return on average assets (ROAA) for the quarter equaled 1.24%, compared to 1.00% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Core return on average equity (ROAE) for the quarter equaled 10.53%, for the quarter compared to 8.39% in the fourth quarter of 2017. The core efficiency ratio for the quarter equaled 57.46%, compared to 62.79% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Total noninterest bearing demand deposits for the quarter equaled 52.2% of total deposits and total non-maturity deposits equaled 83.9% of total deposits, compared to 49.8% and 81.5% for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNet income totaled $1,449,000, or $0.15 per diluted share, for the first quarter, compared to $437,000, or $0.05 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusting for a total of $242,000 tax effected merger related expenses incurred in Q1-2018 and the DTA impairment charge of $930,000, caused by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, in Q4-2017, core earnings in Q1-2018 equaled $1,691,000, or $0.18 per diluted share, compared to core earnings of $1,367,000, or $0.15 per diluted share in Q4-2017.\nAverage interest earning assets equaled $525.8 million in Q1-2018, while average interest bearing liabilities equaled $233.8 million. This compares to $514.3 million and $231.6 million, in Q4-2017, respectively. Total loans averaged $430.7 million in the most recent quarter, compared to $426.8 million in Q4-2017. Total deposits averaged $478.7 million in Q1-2018, compared to $468.3 million in Q4-2017. Total non-maturity deposits averaged $396.1 million in Q1-2018, compare to $381.5 million in Q4-2017.\nThe ROAA for the first three months of 2018 was 1.07%, compared with 0.32% in Q4-2017. Adjusting for tax effected merger related expenses incurred in Q1-2018 and the DTA impairment charge in Q4-2017, core ROAA was 1.24% and 1.00% respectively. The ROAE for the first three months of 2018 equaled 9.02%, compared with 2.68% in Q4-2017. Adjusting for tax effected merger related expenses incurred in Q1-2018 and the DTA impairment charge in Q4-2017, core ROAE equaled 10.53% and 8.39% respectively.\nThe Company recorded a provision for loan and lease losses of $725,000 in Q1-2018, compared to $200,000 in Q4-2017. The increased provision reflects the payoff of a heavily discounted purchased loan. The discount is reflected in total interest income and was offset with an increase in the loan and lease provision. Excluding $130.7 million in loans carried under purchase accounting rules, which are held at a discount of 0.93% as of March 31, 2018, the allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans held for investment equaled 1.39% of loans outstanding.\nShareholders’ equity at the Company as of March 31, 2018, equaled $65.6 million. Both the Company and Bank remained “Well-Capitalized” by regulatory definition at March 31, 2018, with capital ratios as follows:\nMinimum Required\nCompany Bank Tier 1 Leverage Ratio: 4.00% 10.23% 11.22% Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio: 4.50% 12.00% 13.17% Tier 1 Capital Ratio: 6.00% 12.00% 13.17% Total Capital Ratio: 8.00% 13.00% 14.16% About Pacific Commerce Bancorp\nPacific Commerce Bancorp is the parent company for Pacific Commerce Bank.
