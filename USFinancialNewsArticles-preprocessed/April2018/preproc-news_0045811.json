    "text": "DUBLIN, An appeal by Apple and Ireland against a European Union ruling for the U.S. firm to pay 13 billion euros ($16 billion) in disputed taxes is likely to be heard in the autumn, Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said on Tuesday.\nThe European Commission ruled in August 2016 that Apple had received unfair tax incentives. Both Apple and Dublin are appealing the original ruling, saying the iPhone makerâ€™s tax treatment was in line with Irish and European Union law. ($1 = 0.8189 euros) (Reporting by Conor Humphries Editing by Alexander Smith)\n ",
