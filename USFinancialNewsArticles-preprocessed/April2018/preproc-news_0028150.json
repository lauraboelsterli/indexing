    "text": "RABAT (Reuters) - Morocco, a Western partner, deplored U.S.-led air strikes against Syria for complicating the conflict, the foreign ministry said on Saturday.\nU.S., British and French forces struck Syria with more than 100 missiles on Saturday, targeting what they called chemical weapons sites in retaliation for a poison gas attack.\n“Past experiences taught us that military options, including air strikes, no matter how justified they might be, will only complicate political solutions, worsen the suffering of civilian victims and exacerbate anti-Western sentiments,” it said in a statement.\nThe kingdom condemned “in the clearest terms” the use of chemical weapons against Syrian civilians but said the Syria conflict needed a political solution.\nReporting by Ahmed El Jechtimi; Editing by Ulf Laessing and Toby Chopra\n ",
