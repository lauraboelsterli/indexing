    "text": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - Sites hit in a U.S.-led strike in Syria on Saturday included an air base west of Damascus near the Lebanese border, a commander in the regional military alliance that backs President Bashar al-Assad said.\nThe targeted al-Shirai air base is located in al-Dimas, the commander told Reuters.\nThe attack also hit a site in Masyaf, about 170 km (100 miles) north of Damascus, army depots in the eastern Qalamoun region northeast of the capital, the Kisweh area south of Damascus, and a site in the Qasyoun hills overlooking the capital.\nSyrian state media said the attack also struck a scientific research facility in Damascus, which the Pentagon said was used to develop, produce and test chemical and biological weapons.\nReporting by Laila Bassam; Writing by Tom Perry; Editing by Samia Nakhoul and Clarence Fernandez\n ",
