    "text": "For a year, according to a CNBC report, Facebook developed a plan to work with hospitals to scrape an individual's social interactions from their profile to identify whether they lack social supports or have other needs when they get discharged from the hospital. \nAs a doctor and health-tech investor, I'd like to propose an alternative approach: Try talking to a patient. \nCase managers and social workers already play a vitally important role, which has been historically under-appreciated and under-recognized in both the health and tech industries.\nThese individuals are already in regular contact with patients, usually in a clinic or hospital setting, to assess their social determinant needs (a fancy term for things like housing, transportation, financial, social support) and deploy resources to fill these gaps.\nThe role of technology That said, there are ways that the latest technology can help. And there's a category of emerging start-ups doing it right. \nEmerging health-tech companies like CityBlock and BehaveCare are focusing on vulnerable populations who have social determinant needs, and they understand the importance of the real humans who already work with them. Instead of scraping data, they are making the case manager and social worker more effective by deploying teams into communities and engaging patients where they reside to assess these needs and provide solutions.\nOthers like Nuna Health are building sophisticated data graphs that pull in information from patients' insurance claims as well as clinical data and other socio-economic information to develop a rich picture of a patient's needs.\n\nHealthify , Aunt Bertha , and Unite Us are another group of start-ups solely focused on assessing and mapping",
