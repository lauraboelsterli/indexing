    "text": "Gregory Polanco continued his strong start with his second multi-RBI game of the season, and Steven Brault allowed one run in five innings to lead the Pittsburgh Pirates to a 5-2 win over the visiting Cincinnati Reds on Thursday at PNC Park.\nPolanco went 1-for-4 with a tiebreaking two-run home run and three RBIs, giving him nine RBIs on the year as the Pirates improved to 5-1. Josh Harrison and Corey Dickerson each had two hits for Pittsburgh, and both scored, while Dickerson added an RBI.\nBrault (2-0) allowed just three hits in his first start of the season, with the only run he surrendered scoring on a wild pitch. Brault struck out four and issued four walks, throwing 46 of his 80 pitches for strikes.\nThe Pirates caught up to Reds starting pitcher Homer Bailey (0-2) in the bottom of the fifth inning, scoring four runs. Polanco got the rally rolling with a two-run homer that scored Harrison. Josh Bell singled to center two batters later and scored on a Dickerson triple. Dickerson scored two batters later on a throwing error by Cincinnati shortstop Jose Peraza.\nCincinnati got on the board first in the second inning, as Scooter Gennett came home on a wild pitch. Pittsburgh tied the game in the third inning on a Polanco sacrifice fly.\nReds cleanup hitter Adam Duvall added a solo home run in the top of the eighth inning off George Kontos, the only one of four Pirates relievers to allow a run. Felipe Rivero picked up his third save of the season with a scoreless ninth.\nCincinnati finished with five hits, and no Reds player had more than one.\nBailey gave up five runs (four earned) in 4 2/3 innings.\nThe teams meet again on Friday with Pittsburgh’s Trevor Williams (1-0) going against Cincinnati’s Luis Castillo (0-1).\n—Field Level Media\n ",
