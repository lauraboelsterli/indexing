    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is using Tomahawk cruise missiles in its strikes in Syria, and taking aim at multiple targets in the country, a U.S. official told Reuters on Friday, without disclosing whether U.S. aircraft were also involved in strikes.\nThe disclosure came moments after U.S. President Donald Trump said he ordered precision strikes targeting Syrian President Bashar al-Assadâ€™s chemical weapons capabilities after a poison gas attack that killed at least 60 people last week.\nReporting by Phil Stewart; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ",
