    "text": "April 20, 2018 / 6:08 PM / in 27 minutes Twitter bans ads from Russia's Kaspersky Lab Jim Finkle , David Ingram 3 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Twitter Inc ( TWTR.N ) said on Friday that it has banned ads from Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab, saying the cyber-security company’s business model conflicts with advertising rules and citing U.S. government claims that Kaspersky has ties to Russian intelligence agencies.

REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov/File Photo \nTwitter confirmed the ban in an email to Reuters after Kaspersky Lab co-founder Eugene Kaspersky disclosed the development in a blog post on Friday, saying that the company learned of the ban in early January. \nThe ban follows charges by Washington that Kaspersky Lab has close ties to intelligence agencies in Moscow and its software could be used to enable Russian spying, which prompted the Trump administration to ban its products from U.S. government networks. \nKaspersky Lab has repeatedly denied those allegations, saying it will open up its code for inspection so that experts can hunt for vulnerabilities in its products that could be exploited by intelligence agencies, and it has asked a U.S. federal court to overturn the American ban. \nEugene Kaspersky said in his blog post that he was surprised by Twitter’s ban and asked the company to reconsider.

In October it banned Russian media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik, accusing them of interfering in the 2016 U.S. elections. Last month, Twitter banned cryptocurrency ads.
