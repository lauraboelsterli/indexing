Crews are currently investigating the cause and it could take 24 to 36 hours to regain power. Published 4 Hours Ago The Associated Press Alvin Baez | Reuters People in a coffee shop during a power outage that affected several areas in the country, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, September 21, 2016. \nAn island-wide blackout has hit Puerto Rico , which is struggling with an increasingly unstable power grid nearly seven months after Hurricane Maria hit the U.S. territory. \nElectric Power Authority spokeswoman Yohari Molina tells The Associated Press that crews are investigating the cause. Officials said Wednesday it could take 24 to 36 hours to fully restore power. \nIt's the first time since the Category 4 storm hit on Sept. 20 that Puerto Rico has experienced a full island-wide blackout. \nSome 40,000 power customers were still without normal electricity service as a result of the hurricane.
