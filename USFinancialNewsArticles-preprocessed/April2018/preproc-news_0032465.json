    "text": "An Overland Park company is recalling supplements sold for male sexual enhancement because they contain prescription drugs.\nEpic Products LLC announced a voluntary recall of its Euphoric capsules after an analysis by the Food and Drug Administration found they contained two prescription drugs — sildenafil and tadalafil — that are used to treat male erectile dysfunction. The presence of the drugs makes Euphoric an unapproved drug, according to a release.\nEpic sold Euphoric in one-count blister cards, three-count bottles and 12-count bottles at retail stores. The company has discontinued sales of the products.\n\nA primary concern is that users of the unapproved drug who also take nitrates for diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol or heart disease could suffer a fatal cardiovascular collapse. Epic claims it has not received any reports of adverse reactions to the product.\nMore information on the recall can be found on the FDA website. \nMore from Kansas City Business Journal:\nCustom doughnuts headed to the Legends\nFormer nonprofit auditor pleads guilty to numerous embezzlement schemes\nDST employees indicted for embezzling proceeds from data center renovation",
