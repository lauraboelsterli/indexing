FILE PHOTO: The Kobe Steel (Kobelco) headquarters building is seen in Kobe, western Japan October 24, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas White/File Photo\nThe sale is aimed at raising the value of its wholly-owned unit, Shinko Real Estate Co Ltd, and not to raise cash after its widespread data tampering scandal, a Kobe Steel spokesman said.\nUnder the agreement, Kobe Steel will sell its 70 percent stake in Shinko Real Estate to Tokyo Century Corp and 5 percent to Nippon Tochi-Tatemono Co Ltd. The deal is subject to approvals from local authorities and is aimed to be completed on July 1, it said.\nKobe Steel plans to book a special profit of 30 billion yen from the sale in its April to September earnings on a consolidated basis.\nKobe Steel, which supplies steel and aluminum parts to manufacturers of cars, planes and trains around the world, has admitted to supplying products with falsified specifications to more than 600 customers and that the data fraud has been going on for nearly five decades.\n($1 = 109.1800 yen)",
