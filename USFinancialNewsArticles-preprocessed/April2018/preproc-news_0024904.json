    "text": "WILMINGTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ametros has announced the hire of Chris Lagnese and Phyllis Ramondetta, RN, BS, CCM, CLCP, MSCC, CLNC, to lead a new service offering, Health Navigator, within Ametros.\nRamondetta and Lagnese will be focusing primarily on leading and developing a Health Navigation team to provide injured parties with post-settlement resources to better understand their medical care and treatment, provide opportunities for savings to extend the life of medical funds received from a settlement, and to provide 1-on-1 clinical attention and advocacy after they settle their cases.\nAmetros provides post-settlement solutions for injured parties to help manage their medical care once they settle, which can include a Medicare Set Aside or any other allocated medical settlement funds related to a workers’ compensation or liability case. Ametros puts a high focus on providing resources and support so that injured parties can make the most informed decisions possible. The introduction of Health Navigator provides injured parties with more personalized 1-on-1 resources to manage their medical care post-settlement.\nChris Lagnese will be Ametros’ Vice President of Pharmacy and Managed Care and is a pharmacist with more than 25 years of experience managing pharmacy benefit administration and related services. His management and operational experience includes both large pharmacy chain providers as well as pharmacy benefit managers. Most recently, he served as Vice President, Sales & Services at TRICAST and is the former Director, PBA Pharmacy Product for Change Healthcare/Emdeon. Chris brings expertise in group benefits, consumer savings programs and workers’ compensation. He is a member of the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy and National Council for Prescription Drug Programs.\nLagnese will be focused on diversifying and building Ametros’ medical networks to continue to provide injured parties (members) with the best prices and discounts on treatments and prescriptions. He will also work to help members identify areas where they could save more on their medical treatments and provide them with resources to help them make more informed choices as they navigate a complicated healthcare world after settlement.\nRamondetta will be Ametros’ Director of Clinical Solutions and is a registered nurse and legal nurse consultant with a clinical background in occupational health, case management and catastrophic injury. Before joining Ametros, Ramondetta was a Medical Major Case Specialist at Travelers Insurance and previously worked for AIG and The Hartford. She is an expert in the field of workers' compensation and maintains certifications in Case Management, Life Care Planning, Legal Nurse Consulting and Medicare Set Aside Consulting. Ramondetta’s expertise in the medical, claim and legal aspects of a case means she is uniquely qualified to provide medical insight for a broad range of cases.\nRamondetta will be working to build Ametros’ in-house team of nurses providing care coordination to Ametros’ members. She will be focused on providing quality clinical support for injured parties and their families, promoting wellness for Ametros’ members, and ensuring members fully understand their treatment plans and the options available to them.\nBy providing a team to give insight into medical care and treatment plans and to guide members through complex medical issues, Health Navigator can help reduce the burden on injured parties and allow them to focus on returning to health, while receiving personalized attention with a dedicated in-house nurse. Ametros’ Health Navigation team will be available to members through online chat, email, and by phone.\n“We’re excited to begin to offer our members and partners more comprehensive solutions and support when it comes to settlement,” says Marques Torbert, CEO of Ametros. “Historically there have not been post-settlement clinical resources for injured parties. While many professional administrators focus solely on compliance, we take a holistic approach when working with our members. We ensure compliance, but we also think about how we can help them save money and live happier, healthier, and more productive lives. This approach leads to better outcomes and settlements for all parties involved.”\nIn addition to all the benefits Ametros currently provides, the Health Navigation team will deliver experienced in-house nursing and pharmacy resources for their members and referral partners, including:\nAn in-person nurse consultation at settlement which includes 1-on-1 wellness planning Ongoing dedicated nurse and pharmacy resources readily available Monthly nurse check-ins Annual prescription reviews for safety and savings assessment Annual financial planning analysis Specialty opioid / rehabilitation management by a nurse upon request\nAbout Ametros\nAmetros is the industry leader in post-settlement medical administration and a trusted partner for thousands of members receiving funds from workers’ compensation and liability settlements. Founded in 2010, Ametros provides post-settlement medical management services with significant medical and pharmacy discounts along with automated payment technology and Medicare reporting tools. Headquartered just north of Boston in Wilmington, Massachusetts, Ametros may be reached at 877.275.7415 or via www.ametroscards.com .
