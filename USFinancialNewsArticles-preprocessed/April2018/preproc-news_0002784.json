    "text": "Amazon shares fell more than 4.5 percent on Monday after President Donald Trump attacked the company from his Twitter account.\nTrump said via the social media platform on Saturday that Amazon was scamming the U.S. Postal Service, adding the agency loses \"billions of dollars\" delivering packages for the e-commerce giant.\nTrump tweet\nTrump tweet 2\nThis marks Trump's second direct attack on Amazon in less than a week . The president tweeted last week that Amazon was using the post office as its \"delivery boy.\" He also said: \"I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election.\"\nTrump Tweet last week\nBut some would argue Amazon has been good for the Postal Service. In fiscal 2017, the agency's revenue rose 12 percent after a poor financial performance for more than a decade.\nThis follows a report from Axios on Wednesday that said Trump was \"obsessed\" with going after Amazon and wanted to change the e-commerce giant's tax treatment. The report said that several of Trump's friends told him Amazon is hurting their businesses and \"killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.\"\nAmazon shares lost more than 3 percent last week but are still up 23.8 percent year to date.",
