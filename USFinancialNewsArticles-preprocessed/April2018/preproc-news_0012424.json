    "text": "0 COMMENTS Oil prices slid Wednesday, following global equities lower as fears of an escalating trade row between the U.S. and China outweighed a larger-than-expected drop in U.S. oil inventories.\nU.S. crude futures recently traded down 56 cents, or 0.88%, at $62.95 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent, the global benchmark, fell 53 cents, or 0.78%, to $67.59 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe.\nChina early Wednesday announced 25% tariffs on critical American exports , including soybeans, airplanes and automobiles. The retaliatory measures came a day after the Trump administration threatened stiff new tariffs on some $50 billion Chinese imports across 1,300 categories of products. The U.S. earlier this year imposed tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum imports.\nEuropean stocks responded by falling in morning trading Wednesday, with the Stoxx Europe 600 down 0.8% .\n“It’s all about the macro picture right now,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, global head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas. “There’s a sea of red on the equity screens, and oil, as a risk asset, is falling as well.”\nOil tanks are seen at an oil warehouse at Yangshan port in Shanghai.

The drop was more than the 3.3 million-barrel decline expected by the American Petroleum Institute. Analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected on average that crude stocks increased by 1 million barrels in the week ended March 30.\nAnd crude exports surged to an all-time high of 2.175 million barrels a day.\n“This market would be much higher if it wasn’t for the fear factor,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. “Unless the trade war expands, we’re looking at near $70 WTI sometime this quarter.”\nThere were also bearish elements in the data. Oil stockpiles at the Cushing, Okla., delivery hub rose by 3.7 million barrels. And U.S. oil production continued to surge, rising by 27,000 barrels a day to 10.46 million barrels a day.\nGasoline stockpiles fell by 1.1 million barrels—less than the 1.9 million barrel decline that analysts were expecting. Diesel stockpiles rose by 500,000 barrels, compared with expectations of a 1.3 million barrel draw.\nGasoline futures fell 1.5 cents, or 0.76%, to $1.9640 a gallon. Diesel futures fell 2.36 cents, or 1.18%, to $1.9714 a gallon.\nWrite to Christopher Alessi at christopher.alessi@wsj.com and Alison Sider at alison.sider@wsj.com",
