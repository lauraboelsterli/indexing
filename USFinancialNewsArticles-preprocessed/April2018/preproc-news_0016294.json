    "text": "Signals continued efforts of CCIA to support those defining the future of cleantech\nBOULDER, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bolder Industries announces that the CCIA welcomed new board member, Tony Wibbeler, this past month as part of an effort to expand the advanced manufacturing and recycled materials industry knowledge for the organization. Tony is founder and CEO of Bolder Industries, which provides a global solution to the scrap tire problem by converting them to valuable products such as Bolder Black ® , an alternative to carbon black, synthetic oil and natural gas.\n“Our board represents the vibrant and diverse cleantech organizations in Colorado yet we recognized the need to improve our manufacturing presence,” says CCIA Executive Director, Shelly Curtiss, “and Tony brings infectious energy and a passion for creating positive change from the ground up.” Under his leadership, BI has developed technologies that cut to the core of what’s needed to solve growing waste problems, real means of repurposing waste into valuable and profitable materials—a long-held dream in the renewables sector.\nTony’s appointment comes during a commercialization year for Bolder Industries where charter product, Bolder Black, has reached commercial production levels and is the first high-performance carbon black alternative available to rubber and plastics manufacturers.\nCCIA is also well-positioned for a banner year with plans to launch a Cleantech Impact campaign to shine a bright light on the sector and the over 26,000 employees driving change on a state, national and global level.\nAbout Bolder Industries\nBI solves challenging environmental issues for the industrial waste industry by developing sustainable products through technology. Charter product, Bolder Black ® , is a sustainable alternative to traditional carbon black produced using waste tires that would otherwise be landfilled or incinerated. Bolder Black is made in a facility that emits 90% less CO 2 e and uses 90% less H 2 O than traditional carbon black production methods.\nAbout CCIA\nFounded in 2008, CCIA is a statewide, industry-led, industry-focused organization dedicated to promoting Colorado’s cleantech industry. CCIA impacts Colorado’s policies, people, products and programs that drive expansion of a cleaner, cheaper, more efficient and secure energy economy. Through advocacy, public policy leadership, development and education, CCIA works to ensure that Colorado is a global cleantech leader.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180410005155/en/\nBolder Industries\nJessica Hogan, 720-514-9035\nJessica.Hogan@bolderindustries.com\nSource: Bolder Industries",
