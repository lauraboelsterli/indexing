    "text": "Francisco Liriano gave up just one run in his Detroit debut, Victor Martinez drove in three runs and the Tigers downed the visiting Kansas City Royals 6-1 for their first victory of the season Monday afternoon at Comerica Park.\nLiriano, who pitched for Toronto and Houston last season, gave up four hits in 6 2/3 innings with two walks and three strikeouts. Nicholas Castellanos had two hits, two runs scored and an RBI while Miguel Cabrera scored and drove in a run for Detroit, which was swept in a three-game weekend series by Pittsburgh.\nLeonys Martin added two hits and a run scored in Ron Gardenhire’s first win as the Tigers manager. The teams were playing the opener of a three-game series.\nJoe Jimenez, Daniel Stumpf and Warren Saupold combined for 2 1/3 innings of scoreless relief, giving up just one hit combined.\nAlcides Escobar had a double and triple and scored the Royals’ only run. Jason Hammel took the loss, allowing five runs on seven hits in five innings.\nKansas City is now winless in three games this season. It lost twice to another American League Central Division rival, Chicago, in its opening series.\nThe Royals grabbed a 1-0 lead in the third. Escobar led off with a triple and scored on Drew Butera’s sacrifice fly.\nThe Tigers tied it in the bottom of the inning. Dixon Machado singled, advanced on Martin’s walk and scored on Cabrera’s single.\nDetroit took over the game with four runs in the fifth. Martin singled, Jeimer Candelario doubled and Cabrera was intentionally walked to load the bases. Castellanos fought off an inside pitch for a soft single to left, knocking in Martin.\nMartinez followed with a two-run single to right-center field. Castellanos then scored on James McCann’s fielder’s choice, making it 5-1.\nRoyals reliever Blaine Boyer gave up the final run, surrendering a one-out triple to Castellanos followed by Martinez’s sacrifice fly. Castellanos has seven hits and scored six runs through the Tigers’ first four games.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
