    "text": "UNITED NATIONS, April 10 (Reuters) - Russia told the U.N. Security Council it will put two draft resolutions on Syria to a vote on Tuesday because it does not agree with a U.S. text to create a new inquiry into who is to blame for chemical weapons attacks in Syria, diplomats said.\nThe 15-member council is due to vote on the U.S. draft resolution later on Tuesday. Russia asked for the council to also vote on its own draft resolution to create a new inquiry into chemical weapons attacks in Syria, diplomats said.\nRussia said it would then put to a vote another resolution that would specifically support sending investigators from the global chemical weapons watchdog to the site of an alleged deadly attack last Saturday.
