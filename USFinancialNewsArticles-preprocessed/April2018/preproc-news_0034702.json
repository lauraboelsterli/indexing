    "text": "DALLAS, April 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Freeman today announced it has acquired digital technology company Info Salons , a leading provider of registration and attendee database management solutions. The acquisition enables Freeman to integrate the trusted registration solution into its comprehensive event management offerings while also extending its global presence.\n“We’re always looking for ways to simplify the event and show planning processes for our clients; and investing in leading digital technologies enables us to provide the robust capabilities show organizers need to thrive in the ever-evolving events industry. This was the case with our recent Blueprint floor plan management solution launch, and it is the driving factor behind our acquisition of Info Salons,” said Richard Maranville, chief digital officer at Freeman. “With the integration of Info Salons’ digital tools into our event management offerings, we’ll be better equipped to help our clients get the most out of their attendee data.”\nWith the acquisition of Info Salons, Freeman is expanding its comprehensive event management offerings to help mitigate a pain point in the show planning process. The company will benefit from Info Salons’ nearly 30 years of experience in the industry and its successful event technology solutions which aim to improve online and on-site registration processes and unlock valuable attendee data and sales leads for show organizers. Going forward, Info Salons applications and tools will be fully integrated into the digital solutions offered by Freeman.\n“At Info Salons, we have always prided ourselves on delivering cutting-edge, personalized services to our organizer, exhibitor and attendee clients.
