    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - The French military on Saturday targeted Syria’s main chemicals research center as well as two other facilities, French Defence minister Florence Parly said, adding that Russia had been informed before the strikes were carried out.\nA French fighter jet prepares to land at RAF Akrotiri, a military base Britain maintains on Cyprus, April 14, 2018. REUTERS/Yiannis Kourtoglou The minister was speaking hours after President Emmanuel Macron ordered a military intervention in Syria alongside the United States and Britain in an attack on the chemical weapons arsenal of the country’s regime.\n“We are not looking for confrontation and refuse any logic of escalation, that is the reason why we, with our allies, ensured the Russians were warned beforehand,” Parly told journalists in a short statement alongside Foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.\nParly also said cruise missiles had been fired by the French military.\nReporting by Marine Pennetier, Jean-Baptiste Vey; Writing by Matthias Blamont; Editing by Ingrid Melander\n ",
