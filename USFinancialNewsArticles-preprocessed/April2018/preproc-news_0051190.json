    "text": "April 26, 2018 / 5:19 AM / Updated 12 minutes ago Hyundai Motor first-quarter net profit halves, misses estimates\nSEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea’s Hyundai Motor ( 005380.KS ) said on Thursday that its first-quarter net profit had halved from a year ago, falling significantly short of estimates, as a persistent weakness in U.S. and China sales offset stronger business at home. Employees of Hyundai Motor walk past the company's logo after the company's New Year ceremony in Seoul, South Korea, January 2, 2018. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji\nHyundai, which together with affiliate Kia Motors ( 000270.KS ) is the world’s No.5 automaker, reported a quarterly net profit of 668 billion won (443.99 million pounds), versus 1.3 trillion won a year ago.\nAnalysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had on average expected a net profit of 1 trillion won.\nHyundai posted an operating profit of 681 billion won and sales of 22.44 trillion won for the January-to-March quarter.
