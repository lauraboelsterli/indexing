    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Leucadia National Corporation (NYSE:LUK) today announced its financial results for the three month period ended March 31, 2018. Consistent with the expectation expressed in our press release of April 9, 2018, Income before income taxes was $107 million and net income attributable to Leucadia National Corporation common shareholders was $125 million, or $0.34 per diluted share.\nRich Handler, CEO of Leucadia, and Brian Friedman, President of Leucadia, said: \"We are pleased with another quarter of solid performance across Leucadia. Jefferies' first quarter results reflect continued strong performances in Investment Banking, with net revenues of $434 million, and solid performance in both Equities and Fixed Income, with total revenues of $369 million. Investment Banking results reflect a good new-issue equity and debt environment, and another strong quarter in mergers and acquisitions. Fixed Income revenues were a strong $213 million and relatively consistent across the quarter. Equities revenues were $156 million. Our share of Berkadia’s income was $26 million, buoyed by strong originations during the quarter, and our share of HomeFed’s income was also higher than previous quarters, due to a gain from the sale of one of its assets.\n\"Our Leucadia Merchant Banking portfolio also continues to deliver strong results, with National Beef generating pre-tax income of $69 million during a typically lighter seasonal quarter for beef processing. The remainder of our merchant banking portfolio produced solid results, through either cash generation or value-building, offset partly by a $21 million mark-to-market reduction in the value of our HRG position.\n“We patiently continue to develop our alternative asset management platform. During the first quarter, we recorded losses of $78 million mainly due to two strategies impacted by exceptional volatility during the quarter.\n“Our recently announced strategic transactions, including the agreed upon sale of 48% of National Beef, the agreed upon sale of 100% of our equity interest in Garcadia and the acquisition by Vitesse Energy Finance of $190 million of additional Bakken oil and gas assets, will complete an ongoing transformation of Leucadia to a diversified financial services company. We expect these to close in the next four months.”\nAfter the end of the first quarter, through April 26, 2018, Leucadia repurchased a total of 10.3 million common shares at an average price of $24.40 per share. 14.7 million shares remain authorized for repurchase.\n* * * *\nMore information on the Company’s results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 will be provided upon filing of the Company’s Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
