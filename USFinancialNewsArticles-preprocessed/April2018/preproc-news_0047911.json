Commissioned in 1983 as the Elura Mine, the site has been operated by CBH Resources since 2003 and was then renamed as the Endeavor Mine. The orebody at the Endeavor Mine has the form of massive vertical pillars, which is similar to others found in the Cobar Basin. Extraction of approximately 30 million tonnes has occurred to date.\nMetalla has the right to buy 100% of the silver production up to 20.0 million ounces (6.77 million ounces have been delivered as of April 2018) from the Endeavor Mine for an operating cost contribution of US$1.00 per ounce of payable silver, indexed annually for inflation, and a further increment of 50% of the amount by which silver price exceeds US$7.00 per ounce.\nMetalla expects CBH Resources to update its mine plan to be made publicly available in Q2 calendar year 2018.\nJoaquin Project NSR\nA 2.0% NSR royalty payable by Pan American Silver Corporation (“Pan American”) on minerals mined from the concessions which form part of Joaquin Project located in central Santa Cruz Province, Argentina, 145 kilometres from Manantial Espejo silver-gold mine owned by Pan American.\nPan American has announced that it finalized a preliminary feasibility study on the La Morocha deposit, which is part of Joaquin Project. The study recommends the development of the La Morocha deposit as an underground mine, with processing to occur at Pan American's Manantial Espejo mill. Pan American's Board of Directors has approved a capital investment of approximately US$37.8 million to construct the La Morocha underground mine and obtained authorizations to initiate construction on the mining project. Pan American filed a technical report (1) pursuant to National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mining Projects and filed on SEDAR ( www.sedar.com ). The technical report outlines initial 474,000 tonnes of probable reserves at 721 parts per million (“ppm”) Ag and 0.41 ppm Au, representing contained metal of 11 million oz. Ag and 6,300 oz. Au to be targeted during the first three years of the mine plan (please see Pan American’s news release dated January 31, 2018 for further information). Pan American has given guidance that production should start in Q4 of calendar year 2019.\n(1) https://www.panamericansilver.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Joaquin-2018-technical-report.pdf Zaruma Gold Mine NSR\nA 1.5% NSR royalty payable by Core Gold Inc. (“Core Gold”, formerly Dynasty Metals & Mining) on minerals mined from the Zaruma gold mine located in the Zaruma-Portovelo Mining District of southern Ecuador, 3 kilometers north of the town of Zaruma. Between the years 2012 and 2014, the Zaruma mine produced 72,430 oz. of gold and 152,292 oz. of silver. The Zaruma gold mine is estimated to contain a measured and indicated resource of 2.62 million tonnes with an average gold grade of 12.97 grams per tonne (“g/t”) and an inferred resource of 3.7 million tonnes with an average grade of 12.2 g/t (totaling approximately 1.094 million oz. of gold) in a technical report (2) pursuant to National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mining Projects and filed on September 17, 2014.\nCore Gold announced it has signed a term sheet with Investa Bank S.A (“Investa”) to arrange a debt facility for up to US$15 million. Core Gold’s current loan outstanding to Vertex Managed Value Portfolio and Vertex Enhanced Income Fund (together as “Vertex”) may be restructured as part of the proposed facility with Investa. Core Gold is still in the process of closing the proposed loan facility with the last update on January 19, 2018. Metalla believes that if completed, this would allow Core Gold the ability to restart operations at Zaruma during calendar year 2018. Metalla has received royalty payments from Core Gold on production that occurred between 2012 and 2014 from the judgement it acquired as part of the Coeur transaction.\n(2) https://www.coregoldinc.com/assets/docs/reports/2014-09-18-Zaruma-Independent-Preliminary-Assessment.pdf Hoyle Pond Extension NSR\nA 2.0% NSR royalty payable by Goldcorp Inc. (“Goldcorp”) on the Hoyle Pond Extension Royalties which are located on claims that are beneath the Kidd metallurgical complex and immediately adjacent to the east and northeast of the Hoyle Pond mine complex. There is a 500,000 oz. Au exemption on the leased mining rights. Currently, there are no publicly disclosed reserves/resources on the extension property. In Goldcorp’s 2017 Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources estimates update (3) (please see Goldcorp’s news release dated October 25, 2017), Goldcorp stated that reserve replacement for the Porcupine camp will be focused on the down plunge extension at Hoyle Pond. Metalla is expecting a significant amount of drilling to take place in calendar year 2018 on the extension property with the potential to be able to quantify reserves/resources in calendar year 2019.\n(3) https://www.goldcorp.com/English/investors/news-releases/default.aspx#2017#Goldcorp-reports-2017-reserve-and-resource-estimates-and-provides-exploration-update Mirado Mine Royalty\nA 1.0% NSR royalty payable by Orefinders Resources Inc. (“Orefinders”) on its Mirado Mine located to the southeast of Kirkland Lake, Ontario within the prolific gold producing Abitibi Greenstone Belt. Orefinders has filed on SEDAR its Preliminary Economic Assessment (4) (“PEA”) of the South Zone Open Pit, a part of the Mirado project.\nThis PEA considers only production from a specific area which encompasses approximately five percent of Orefinders’ Mirado project. The mineral resource contemplated within this PEA for mining is within the South Zone’s Open Pit and is near surface mineralization which can be economically mined within a relatively short time frame and without the use of an on-site processing or tailings facility. This PEA’s economics indicate this project has an after-tax internal rate of return (“IRR”) of 158% and a pre-tax undiscounted cash flow of $30.8 million and a post-tax net present value of $20.5 million at a 5% discount rate. Payback period on capital cost is reported at 7 months. These estimates are based on an average gold price of US$1,300 per ounce and an exchange rate of US$0.76/C$1.00.\n(4) http://www.orefinders.ca/march-1-2018/ Qualified Person\nThe technical information contained in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Charles Beaudry, geologist M.Sc., member of the Association of Professional Geoscientists of Ontario and of the Ordre des Géologues du Québec and a consultant to Metalla.

The forward-looking statements herein are made as of the date of this press release only and the Company does not assume any obligation to update or revise them to reflect new information, estimates or opinions, future events or results or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.\nOften, but not always, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as “plans”, “expects”, “is expected”, “budgets”, “scheduled”, “estimates”, “forecasts”, “predicts”, “projects”, “intends”, “targets”, “aims”, “anticipates” or “believes” or variations (including negative variations) of such words and phrases or may be identified by statements to the effect that certain actions “may”, “could”, “should”, “would”, “might” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved. Forward-looking information in this press release includes, but is not limited to, statements with respect to future events or future performance of Metalla, disclosure regarding the precious metal purchase agreements and royalty payments to be paid to Metalla by property owners or operators of mining projects pursuant to net smelter returns and other royalty agreements of Metalla, continued ramp-up at the Endeavor Mine, management’s expectations regarding Metalla’s growth, results of operations, estimated future revenues, carrying value of assets, future dividends, and requirements for additional capital, production estimates, production costs and revenue, future demand for and prices of commodities, expected mining sequences, business prospects and opportunities. Such forward-looking statements reflect management’s current beliefs and are based on information currently available to management.\nForward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.

Metalla has included certain performance measures in this press release that do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS including average cash cost per ounce of attributable silver, average realized price per ounce of attributable silver, and cash margin. Average cost per ounce of attributable silver is calculated by dividing the cash cost of sales, plus applicable selling charges, by the attributable ounces sold. In the precious metals mining industry, this is a common performance measure but does not have any standardized meaning. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance and ability to generate cash flow. Cash margin is calculated by subtracting the average cash cost per ounce of attributable silver from the average realized price per ounce of attributable silver. The Company presents cash margin as it believes that certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance in comparison to other companies in the precious metals mining industry who present results on a similar basis. The presentation of these non-IFRS measures is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Other companies may calculate these non-IFRS measures differently.\nSource:Metalla Royalty & Streaming Ltd.",
