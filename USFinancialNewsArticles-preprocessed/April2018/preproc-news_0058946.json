    "text": "When Blondy Baruti showed up to the premiere of his first film, Marvel’s “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,” last May, he wasn’t sure he’d made the final cut. He had a small role as Huhtar, a member of a bandit clan who gets killed off. It was enough, though. “Whoa, this is me!” he thought when he saw himself on screen.\nIt’s an improbable achievement. In a new memoir, “The Incredible True Story of Blondy Baruti,” co-written with Joe Layden, Mr. Baruti traces his unlikely trajectory from war-torn central Africa to Division I basketball at the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma and now to Hollywood, where he’s trying to make it as an actor.\nMr. Baruti, 27, jokes that he’s been through so much, “I feel like I’m 50 or 60.” He was born in Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1991, but his family soon moved east to Goma, a city near the Rwandan border. Before he turned 10, the city became a battleground in a five-year conflict that killed millions. Fighters from Rwanda and Uganda flooded across the border, prompting Mr. Baruti’s family to flee.\nOver the next year, they traveled on foot more than 300 miles, often living on rotten fruit and stumbling across dead bodies in the jungle, Mr. Baruti says. They sought refuge in the city of Kisangani, only to find it also ravaged by war. He remembers his mother’s reaction: “I saw the look on her face, and she dropped on her knees,” he says.\nMonths later, they finally reached Kinshasa, showing up “bedraggled but alive,” he writes, at the door of Mr. Baruti’s grandmother. At first, traumatized by his journey, he didn’t want to leave the family house. But he soon started to adjust, acting in school theater productions and playing basketball. The courts were miles from his house, and the walk back often took him until 9 p.m. It worried his mother. “It was very, very dangerous to walk around in the Congo at night,” he says.\nOne day after practice, a trainer who worked with the team told him that he had contacts who could help get him to the U.S. and eventually to a college basketball career, Mr. Baruti says. Through the trainer and a cousin already in the U.S., Mr. Baruti ended up finishing high school in Mesa, Ariz., living with the parents of his assistant basketball coach.\nIn 2010, he earned a scholarship to the University of Tulsa. He played his freshman year, but three days into his second year, he injured his ankle and never fully recovered. “I just felt like someone dropped a hammer on my head,” he says.\nToday, Mr. Baruti works on writing scripts and auditioning for roles. Photo: Shayan Asgharnia for The Wall Street Journal He was determined to become successful another way. “I’ve been to war, even worse than this,” he told himself. “I’m not going to just let this thing get me down.” He enrolled in drama classes and started writing his life story, hoping one day to turn it into a book.\nWhen he graduated in 2014, he went to Los Angeles, sleeping on friends’ couches and in his car while going on auditions. Nothing came through, so he moved back to Oklahoma.\nFriends there introduced him to a local acting agent, Becky Switzer, the wife of Barry Switzer, the former football coach for the University of Oklahoma and the Dallas Cowboys. Ms. Switzer says that she told Mr. Baruti about an audition for the role of an African warrior who becomes an NBA player in a new ABC TV series. “The guy is so lovable,” Ms. Switzer says. Incredibly, he landed the lead role, but ABC didn’t end up picking up the show.\nMr. Baruti was devastated, but he had made yet another fortuitous connection during the filming of the pilot. Actress and philanthropist Jami Gertz, who had been cast in the show, befriended him. She invited him to spend a few weeks living with her and her husband, Atlanta Hawks principal owner and executive chairman of Ares Management Tony Ressler. They then offered to pay for an apartment for him in L.A.’s Koreatown and provide him with a car and health insurance until this July. Mr. Baruti took them up on it.\nMore Weekend Confidential\nAt 90, Mary Higgins Clark Is Still Cranking Out Page-Turners April 20, 2018 Business Is a Family Affair for Subway’s Suzanne Greco April 14, 2018 David Chang’s Culinary Mash-Ups April 6, 2018 Ms. Gertz also introduced him to Bob Iger, the chief executive of Disney, ABC’s parent company. Mr. Baruti got a one-year talent contract with ABC, though it ended at the end of 2016 and he didn’t get a role during that time. Mr. Iger also helped him to get the part in the “Guardians of the Galaxy” sequel. (Both Mr. Iger’s and Ms. Gertz’s spokespeople confirm the account.)\nMeanwhile, Mr. Baruti’s acting agent introduced him to a literary agent to get his book published. “It’s a chain formed through conversations that each started with, ‘I just heard a story you’ve got to hear,’” says his literary agent, David Doerrer. Mr. Baruti just finished a script based on his life that he hopes to turn into a movie, and continues to audition. He did another pilot for ABC, but it hasn’t been picked up.\nHe talks to his family in Congo every week and sends his mother money. “Did I deserve to be given the opportunity of a new life in America when so many of my friends were far less fortunate?” he asks in his book. “I will forever try to prove myself worthy.”\nWrite to Alexandra Wolfe at alexandra.wolfe@wsj.com",
