    "text": "WILMINGTON, N.C., April 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Live Oak Bancshares, Inc. (Nasdaq:LOB) (“Live Oak” or “the Company”) today reported first quarter net earnings available to common shareholders of $12.5 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, compared to $6.1 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017.\n“We kicked off the year in fine fashion with a very strong performance in the first quarter. We enjoyed 43% growth in our loan and lease portfolio compared to one year ago while significantly boosting our recurring revenues and liquidity position. We are steadily expanding our array of industry verticals and continuing to diversify our product offerings. We are intensely focused on serving the needs of small businesses across the U.S. and revolutionizing the financial services industry through innovative technology solutions,” said James S. Mahan, III, Chief Executive Officer of Live Oak.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Key Measures\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Increase (Decrease) Q1 2018 Q1 2017 Dollars Percent Q4 2017 Net interest income and servicing revenues $ 31,374 $ 21,564 $ 9,810 45 % $ 28,977 Net income 12,453 6,112 6,341 104 71,730 Diluted earnings per share 0.30 0.17 0.13 76 1.74 Non-GAAP net income (1) 12,721 6,808 5,913 87 16,875 Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (1) 0.31 0.19 0.12 63 0.41 Loan and lease production: Loans and leases originated $ 397,559 $ 468,663 $ (71,104 ) (15 )% $ 483,422 % Fully funded 69.5 % 63.2 % n/a n/a 42.9 % Loan sales: Guaranteed loans sold $ 247,243 $ 208,715 $ 38,528 18 % $ 211,654 Net gains on sales of guaranteed loans 24,418 18,952 5,466 29 23,314 Average net gain on sale of guaranteed loans, per million sold 98.76 90.80 7.96 9 110.15 (1) See accompanying GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation.\nLoans and Leases\nAt March 31, 2018, the total loan and lease portfolio of $2.16 billion increased 43.0% above its level of a year ago and by 6.8% above its level at December 31, 2017. Net loans and leases held for investment increased $94.2 million, or 7.1%, to $1.41 billion at March 31, 2018, from $1.32 billion at December 31, 2017. Loans held for sale increased $40.1 million, or 5.9%, to $720.5 million at March 31, 2018, from $680.5 million at December 31, 2017. Loan and lease originations totaled $397.6 million during the first quarter of 2018, a decline from the prior quarter due to a combination of lending seasonality and increased competitive pressures. The total loan and lease portfolio at March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, of $2.16 billion and $2.02 billion, respectively, were comprised of approximately 61.3% and 61.4% of unguaranteed loans and leases, respectively.\nAverage loans and leases were $2.14 billion during the first quarter of 2018 compared to $1.91 billion during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income for the first quarter of 2018 increased to $24.5 million compared to $15.6 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $23.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase was driven by the significant growth in the combined held for sale and held for investment loan and lease portfolios and reflected the Company's initiative to grow recurring revenue sources by increasing the level of loans and leases retained on the consolidated balance sheet. The net interest margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 3.72%, a decline of 35 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to the reinvestment of a portion of the deposit growth in the first quarter into liquid assets and securities and, to a lesser extent, the rising costs of deposit gathering. The Company anticipates that it is positioned to benefit from the rising rate environment with 75.3% of the total held for sale and held for investment loan and lease portfolio priced at variable rates that adjust on either a calendar monthly or quarterly basis.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $30.8 million, compared to $25.8 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $95.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 which included a $68.0 million gain arising from the Company’s investment in Apiture. Excluding this one-time gain, noninterest income totaled $27.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNet gains on sales of loans increased to $24.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $19.0 million in the first quarter of 2017 and $23.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The volume of guaranteed loan sales in the first quarter of 2018 rose to $247.2 million compared to $208.7 million in the first quarter of 2017 and $211.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The average net gain on guaranteed loan sales increased to $98.8 thousand per million sold in the first quarter of 2018 versus $90.8 thousand per million sold in the first quarter of 2017 and declined from $110.2 thousand per million sold in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company believes that the recent changes in average loan sale pricing is primarily the result of the mix of loans sold during the quarter and not reflective of an overall decline in market performance.\nLoan servicing revenues of $6.9 million in the first quarter of 2018 rose by $975 thousand, or 16.5%, from the first quarter of 2017 and by $897 thousand, or 14.9%, from the fourth quarter of 2017. The net loss resulting from the revaluation of the servicing asset totaled $5.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $3.1 million compared to the first quarter of 2017 but reduced from the net loss of $6.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nLease income from solar panels contributed $1.6 million in noninterest income in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and none in the first quarter of 2017. The Company began offering operating lease agreements for solar panels to third parties at the end of the first quarter of 2017.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $38.1 million compared to $33.0 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $41.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The $5.1 million, or 15.4%, increase in noninterest expense for the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 reflected the ongoing expansion of the Company’s workforce, industry verticals, infrastructure, and new products in support of its growth strategy.\nSalaries and employee benefits for the first quarter of 2018 increased to $20.2 million compared to $18.7 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $19.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Included in these totals is stock-based compensation expense in the first quarter of 2018 of $2.3 million compared to $3.7 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $1.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in salaries and benefits, inclusive of stock-based compensation, is the result of the ongoing expansion of the Company’s workforce and infrastructure to support its growth initiatives.\nCompared to the first quarter of 2017, there were increases in data processing expense of $1.1 million and equipment expense of $2.0 million for the first quarter of 2018. Largely influencing the increase in data processing was the contribution of software development resources to Apiture which transferred the recognition of costs associated with the Company’s technology development from salaries and employee benefits to data processing. The increase in equipment expense reflected the higher levels of depreciation related to solar panels acquired for the Company’s renewable energy leasing business.\nCompared to the fourth quarter of 2017, noninterest expense decreased $3.0 million, or 7.2%. The decrease was primarily the result of one-time costs associated with events in the fourth quarter that elevated the noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2017, most notably due to a net impairment charge of $3.6 million.\nAsset Quality\nThe unguaranteed exposure of nonperforming loans increased to $7.4 million, or 0.51% of total loans and leases held for investment, at March 31, 2018, compared to $3.6 million, or 0.27%, at December 31, 2017. Total nonperforming loans increased to $36.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $23.5 million at the end of the prior quarter and was primarily related to older verticals.\nThe unguaranteed exposure of foreclosed assets increased to $101 thousand at March 31, 2018, from $90 thousand at December 31, 2017. Foreclosed assets increased $238 thousand to $1.5 million at March 31, 2018, from $1.3 million at December 31, 2017.\nNet charge-offs declined to $532 thousand in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $892 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $1.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average held for investment loans and leases, annualized, for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 were 0.15% and 0.63%, respectively.\nProvision for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe provision for loan and lease losses for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $4.4 million compared to $4.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $1.5 million for the first quarter of 2017. The first quarter of 2018 provision greatly exceeded net charge-offs, thus adding to loan and lease loss reserves commensurate with the continued growth of the loan and lease portfolio.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses totaled $28.1 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $24.2 million at December 31, 2017. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases held for investment was 1.95% and 1.80% at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nIncome Tax\nIncome tax expense was $315 thousand in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $798 thousand in the first quarter of 2017 and $1.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company’s effective tax rate is predominantly driven by the leasing of renewable energy assets that generate investment tax credits. As the lessor of these assets, the Company is accomplishing broader strategic initiatives in the renewable energy sector.\nInvestment Securities\nInvestment securities increased by $285.1 million, or 305.4%, to $378.5 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $93.4 million at December 31, 2017. This increase is related to the Company purchasing $293.0 million of residential mortgage-backed securities during the first quarter of 2018 as part of a strategic plan to enhance the Company's contingent funding sources.\nDeposits\nTotal deposits increased by $713.1 million, or 31.5%, to $2.97 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $2.26 billion at December 31, 2017, following successful deposit gathering campaigns to strengthen the Company’s liquidity position. Average total interest-bearing deposits for the first quarter of 2018 increased $499.6 million, or 24.9%, to $2.51 billion, compared to $2.01 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017. The ratio of average total loans and leases to average interest-bearing deposits was 85.2% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 95.0% for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nLong Term Borrowings\nLong term borrowings decreased by $23.1 million, or 86.9%, to $3.5 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $26.6 million at December 31, 2017. This decrease was a result of the Company repaying debt during the first quarter of 2018.\nConference Call\nLive Oak will host a conference call to discuss quarterly results at 9:00 a.m. ET tomorrow morning (April 26, 2018).

release presents the non-GAAP financial measures previously shown. The adjustments to reconcile from the applicable GAAP financial measure to the non-GAAP financial measures are included where applicable in financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company considers these adjustments to be relevant to ongoing operating results. The Company believes that excluding the amounts associated with these adjustments to present the non-GAAP financial measures provides a meaningful base for period-to-period comparisons, which will assist regulators, investors, and analysts in analyzing the operating results or financial position of the Company. The non-GAAP financial measures are used by management to assess the performance of the Company’s business for presentations of Company performance to investors, and for other reasons as may be requested by investors and analysts. The Company further believes that presenting the non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors and analysts to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis as that applied by management. Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. Although non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by shareholders to evaluate a company, they have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results reported under GAAP.\nSource:Live Oak Bancshares, Inc.",
