    "text": "Revenues up 9.4 percent year-over-year\nEarnings and Adjusted EBITDA above previously-announced estimates\nCALABASAS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ASGN Incorporated (NYSE: ASGN), one of the foremost providers of IT and professional services in the technology, creative/digital, engineering, life sciences and government sectors, today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights\nRevenues were $685.2 million, up 9.4 percent over the first quarter of 2017 (up 9.2 percent on a same \"Billable Days\" and \"Constant Currency\" basis). Net income was $29.1 million ($0.55 per diluted share), up from $22.4 million ($0.42 per diluted share) 2017. Adjusted Net Income (a non-GAAP) measure was $44.0 million ($0.83 per diluted share), up from $32.2 million ($0.61 per diluted share) 2017. Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) was $74.8 million (10.9 percent of revenues), up from $64.6 million (10.3 percent of revenues) 2017. Cash flows from operating activities were $55.8 million, up from $43.8 million 2017. Free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) was $49.6 million or 7.2 percent of revenues. Leverage ratio (a non-GAAP measure) was 1.80 to 1 at March 31, 2018, down from 1.89 to 1 at December 31, 2017. Effective April 2, 2018, acquired ECS Federal, LLC (\"ECS\") for $775.0 million in cash and amended credit facility.\nManagement Commentary\n\"We are pleased with our performance 2018 and our ability to deliver financial results above our previously-announced estimates,\" said Peter Dameris, Chief Executive Officer of ASGN. \"We delivered our 17 th consecutive quarter of revenue growth above that of the IT staffing industry, led by the continued deepening of large customer relationships and the accelerated adoption of our delivery model. We expect our size and service offerings will continue to position ASGN to generate solid above-market growth in the quarters ahead.\"\nMr. Dameris continued, \"Our acquisition of ECS, which closed on April 2 nd , strengthens our position as one of the largest and fasting growing IT services firms in North America and increases our addressable end market to $279 billion by virtue of our entering the $129 billion Government Services space. ECS, which prior to the acquisition was one of the largest privately-held government services contractors in the United States, is well positioned to benefit from increased spending by the federal government on next generation, mission critical technology solutions, including Cyber Security, Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence and Cloud Integration.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nRevenues were $685.2 million, up 9.4 percent year-over-year (9.2 percent on a \"Same Billable Days\" and \"Constant Currency\" basis, non-GAAP measures). Revenues for the quarter included a $5.3 million contribution from Stratacuity, which was acquired in August 2017.\nAssignment revenues were $650.3 million, up 9.4 percent year-over-year and permanent placement revenues were $34.9 million (5.1 percent of revenues) compared with $32.0 million (5.1 percent of revenues) 2017.\nOur largest segment, Apex, accounted for 78.6 percent of total revenues and grew 11.6 percent year-over-year. Our Oxford Segment accounted for 21.4 percent of total revenues and was up 1.8 percent year-over-year.\nGross profit was $217.7 million, up $19.6 million, or 9.9 percent year-over-year. Gross margin was 31.8 percent, up from 31.6 percent 2017. The year-over-year expansion in gross margin related to lower state unemployment tax rates and a slightly higher mix of higher-margin business in certain divisions.\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $164.4 million (24.0 percent of revenues), compared with $146.1 million (23.3 percent of revenues) 2017. SG&A expenses for the quarter included acquisition, integration and strategic planning expenses of $9.8 million, compared with $0.9 million 2017.\nAmortization of intangible assets was $7.6 million, down from $8.5 million 2017. The decrease was due to the accelerated amortization method for certain acquired intangibles, which have higher amortization rates at the beginning of their useful life.\nInterest expense was $6.5 million compared with $8.5 million 2017. Interest expense for the quarter was comprised of $5.3 million of interest on the credit facility, $0.9 million of amortization of deferred loan costs and $0.3 million of costs related to the amendment to our credit facility for the acquisition of ECS, which closed on April 2, 2018. The decrease in interest expense reflected a lower debt balance and an average lower interest rate as a result of the amendments to our credit facility in 2017.\nThe effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.3 percent, which reflected the lower federal corporate tax rate related to the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as a $0.5 million reduction in income taxes for excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation.\nNet income was $29.1 million ($0.55 per diluted share), up from $22.4 million ($0.42 per diluted share) 2017. Adjusted Net Income (a non-GAAP measure) was $44.0 million ($0.83 per diluted share), up from $32.2 million ($0.61 per diluted share) 2017. Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) was $74.8 million, or 10.9 percent of revenues, up from $64.6 million (10.3 percent of revenues) 2017. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures are included in this release.\nCash flows from operating activities were $55.8 million and free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) was $49.6 million. At March 31, 2018, our leverage ratio (a non-GAAP measure) was 1.80 to 1, down from 1.89 to 1 at December 31, 2017.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Financial Estimates\nASGN is providing financial estimates for the second quarter of 2018, which include the estimated financial results for ECS, which was acquired on April 2, 2018. ECS accounts for approximately 17.5 percent of total estimated revenues for the second quarter of 2018. Its operating performance to date and estimated performance for the second quarter are in line with the performance expectations that were the basis for the previously-announced full year financial estimates for ECS.\nThese estimates do not include any acquisition, integration or strategic planning expenses and assume no deterioration in the markets that ASGN serves. These estimates also assume no significant change in foreign exchange rates.\nThe estimate for interest expense includes $5.8 million in one-time expenses related to the amendment of the credit facility in April 2018. These one-time expenses are \"added-back\" in the determination of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA (both non-GAAP measures). Reconciliations of estimated net income to these non-GAAP measures are presented herein.\nRevenues of $860.0 million to $870.0 million Gross margin of 29.5 percent to 30.0 percent SG&A expenses (excludes amortization of intangible assets) of $174.1 million to $177.1 million (includes $7.4 million in depreciation and $8.7 million (1) in stock-based compensation expense) Amortization of intangible assets of $18.4 million Interest expense of $20.5 million, comprised of (i) cash interest expense of $13.1 million, (ii) one-time expenses of $5.8 million related to amendment to the credit facility and (iii) amortization of deferred loan costs of $1.6 million Effective tax rate of 26.5 percent (before any excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation) Net income of $31.1 million to $34.8 million Earnings per diluted share of $0.59 to $0.66 Diluted shares outstanding of 52.9 million Adjusted EBITDA (2) (a non-GAAP measure) of $100.0 million to $105.0 million Adjusted Net Income (3) (a non-GAAP measure) of $53.6 million to $57.3 million Adjusted Net Income per diluted share (2) (a non-GAAP measure) of $1.01 to $1.08\n(1) Stock-based compensation expense is approximately $3.8 million higher than the first quarter of 2018. The sequential increase reflects, among other things, the expense of: (i) awards granted to ECS management and employees and (ii) performance-based awards that were valued for accounting purposes at $85.53 per share, which was the closing price on the day the performance targets were approved by the Company's Compensation Committee. (2) Includes $2.7 million in depreciation related to an ECS project that is included in costs of services. (3) Does not include the “Cash Tax Savings on Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets.” These savings total $6.8 million each quarter, or $0.13 per diluted share, and represent the economic value of the tax deduction that we receive from the amortization of goodwill and trademarks. Our financial estimates above are based on our estimate of “Billable Days” which are Business Days (calendar days for the period less weekends and holidays) adjusted for other factors, such as the day of the week a holiday occurs, additional time taken off around holidays, year-end client furloughs and inclement weather. For the second quarter, we estimate billable days of 63.7, which is 0.1 fewer days than the second quarter of 2017.\nOn a pro forma basis, which assumes the acquisition of ECS occurred at the beginning of 2017, our revenue estimates imply year-over-year growth of 7.7 to 9.0 percent (revenues for ECS in Q2 2017 were approximately $145 million). Our financial estimates assume our Apex and Oxford segments on a combined basis will grow 8.0 to 9.5 percent and our ECS segment will grow mid-single digits. We also estimate that the inclusion of ECS will be accretive to our Adjusted Net Income per diluted share by $0.11 to $0.13 in the second quarter.\nConference Call\nASGN will hold a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. EDT to review its financial results for the first quarter.

Such information is provided as additional information, not as an alternative to our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"), and is intended to enhance an overall understanding of our current financial performance. These terms might not be calculated in the same manner as, and thus might not be comparable to, similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The financial statement tables that accompany this press release include a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Below is a discussion of our non-GAAP financial measures.\nEBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of intangible assets) and Adjusted EBITDA (EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense and, as applicable, acquisition, integration and strategic planning expenses, write-off of loan costs and impairment charges) are used to determine a portion of the compensation for some of our executives and employees. Stock-based compensation expense is added to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA because it is a non-cash expense. Write-off of loan costs, acquisition, integration and strategic planning expenses and impairment charges are added, as applicable, to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA as they are not indicative of the performance of our core business on an ongoing basis.\nNon-GAAP net income (net income, less income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, plus, as applicable, credit facility amendment expenses, acquisition, integration and strategic planning expenses, accretion of fair value discount on contingent consideration, impairment charges, and the tax effect of these items) provides a method for assessing our operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of our core business on an ongoing basis. Adjusted Net Income (Non-GAAP net income plus amortization of intangible assets, less income taxes on amortization for financial reporting purposes not deductible for income tax purposes) provides a method for assessing our operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of our core business on an ongoing basis, adjusted for some of the cash flows associated with amortization of intangible assets to more fully present the performance of our acquisitions.\nConstant currency information removes the effect of year-over-year changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Constant currency information is calculated using the foreign currency exchange rates from the same period in the prior year.\nBillable Days are Business Days (calendar days for the period less weekends and holidays) adjusted for other factors, such as the day of the week a holiday occurs, additional time taken off around holidays, year-end client furloughs and inclement weather. In order to remove the fluctuations caused by comparable periods having different billable days, revenues on a Same Billable Days basis are calculated by taking the current period average revenue per billable day, multiplied by the number of billable days from the same period in the prior year.\nThe term Same Billable Days and Constant Currency basis means that the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign currency exchange rates has been removed from the Same Billable Days basis calculation.\nFree cash flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, less capital expenditures. Management believes this provides useful information to investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can be used for strategic opportunities. Our leverage ratio provides information about our compliance with loan covenants and is calculated in accordance with our credit agreement, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), by dividing our total indebtedness by trailing 12 months Adjusted EBITDA.\nReasons for Presentation of Operating Metrics\nOperating metrics are intended to enhance the overall understanding of our business and our current financial performance. These operating metrics might not be calculated in the same manner as, and thus might not be comparable to, similarly titled metrics reported by other companies. The operating metrics presented on this release are calculated as follows: average number of staffing consultants are full time equivalent staffing consultant headcount in the quarter; average number of contract professionals and average number of customers are the number of contract professionals employed each week and the number of customers served each week, averaged for the quarter, respectively (average is weighted by total number of hours billed per week); top 10 customers as a percentage of revenue are the 10 largest clients defined by the revenue generated in the quarter, divided by total revenues in the quarter; gross profit per staffing consultant is gross profit for the quarter divided by the average number of staffing consultants; average bill rate is total assignment revenue client billings in the quarter divided by total hours billed in the quarter.\nSafe Harbor\nCertain statements made in this news release are “ ” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and involve a high degree of risk and uncertainty. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding the Company's anticipated financial and operating performance.\nAll statements in this release, other than those setting forth strictly historical information, are . Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results might differ materially. In particular, the Company makes no assurances that the estimates of revenues, gross margin, SG&A, amortization, effective tax rate, net income, diluted shares outstanding, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and related per share amounts (as applicable) set forth above will be achieved. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include actual demand for our services, our ability to attract, train and retain qualified staffing consultants, our ability to remain competitive in obtaining and retaining clients, the availability of qualified contract professionals, management of our growth, continued performance and improvement of our enterprise-wide information systems, our ability to manage our litigation matters, the successful integration of our acquired subsidiaries, and other risks detailed from time to time in our reports filed with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, as filed with the SEC on March 1, 2018. We specifically disclaim any intention or duty to update any contained in this news release.\nSUMMARY CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (Unaudited)\n(In thousands,\nThree Months Ended March 31, December 31, 2018 2017 2017 Revenues $ 685,173 $ 626,528 $ 679,035 Costs of services 467,436 428,384 458,358 Gross profit 217,737 198,144 220,677 Selling, general and administrative expenses 164,444 146,072 151,447 Amortization of intangible assets 7,601 8,464 8,433 Operating income 45,692 43,608 60,797 Interest expense (6,545 ) (8,501 ) (5,976 ) Income before income taxes 39,147 35,107 54,821 Provision for income taxes 9,907 12,725 (12,556 ) Income from continuing operations 29,240 22,382 67,377 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax\n(148 ) 9 (46 ) Net income $ 29,092 $ 22,391 $ 67,331 Per share income from continuing operations and net income: Basic $ 0.56 $ 0.43 $ 1.29 Diluted $ 0.55 $ 0.42 $ 1.28 Number of shares and share equivalents used to calculate earnings per share:\nBasic 52,178 52,658 52,038 Diluted 52,831 53,249 52,822 SEGMENT FINANCIAL INFORMATION (Unaudited)\nFOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AND 2017\n(Dollars in millions)\n2018 2017 Year-Over-Year Change\nRevenues: Apex: Assignment $ 524.9 $ 471.3 11.4 % Permanent placement 13.6 11.2 21.3 % 538.5 482.5 11.6 % Oxford: Assignment 125.4 123.2 1.7 % Permanent placement 21.3 20.8 2.4 % 146.7 144.0 1.8 % Consolidated: Assignment 650.3 594.5 9.4 % Permanent placement 34.9 32.0 9.1 % $ 685.2 $ 626.5 9.4 % Percentage of total revenues: Apex 78.6 % 77.0 % Oxford 21.4 % 23.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Assignment 94.9 % 94.9 % Permanent placement 5.1 % 5.1 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Domestic 94.5 % 95.2 % Foreign 5.5 % 4.8 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Gross profit: Apex $ 158.6 $ 139.9 13.4 % Oxford 59.1 58.2 1.5 % Consolidated $ 217.7 $ 198.1 9.9 % Gross margin: Apex 29.5 % 29.0 % Oxford 40.3 % 40.4 % Consolidated 31.8 % 31.6 % SELECTED CASH FLOW INFORMATION (Unaudited)\nFOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AND 2017 (In thousands)\n2018 2017 Cash provided by operating activities $ 55,795 $ 43,800 Capital expenditures (6,198 ) (6,792 ) Free cash flow (non-GAAP measure) $ 49,597 $ 37,008 Cash used in investing activities $ (6,218 ) $ (6,775 ) Cash used in financing activities $ (7,667 ) $ (40,215 ) SELECTED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET DATA AS OF MARCH 31, 2018 AND DECEMBER 31, 2017 (In thousands)\n2018 2017 (Unaudited) Cash and cash equivalents $ 78,962 $ 36,667 Accounts receivable, net 443,338 428,536 Total current assets 555,541 499,523 Goodwill and intangible assets, net 1,240,258 1,246,861 Total assets 1,858,159 1,810,129 Total current liabilities 186,035 166,717 Working capital 369,506 332,806 Long-term debt 565,929 575,213 Other long-term liabilities 75,979 76,808 Stockholders’ equity 1,030,216 991,391 RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME TO EBITDA (NON-GAAP MEASURE) AND ADJUSTED EBITDA (NON-GAAP MEASURE) (Unaudited)\nFOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AND 2017 (In thousands)\n2018 2017 Net income $ 29,092 $ 22,391 (Income) loss from discontinued operations, net of tax\n148 (9 ) Interest expense 6,545 8,501 Provision for income taxes 9,907 12,725 Depreciation 6,812 6,011 Amortization of intangible assets 7,601 8,464 EBITDA (non-GAAP measure) 60,105 58,083 Stock-based compensation 4,891 5,570 Acquisition, integration and strategic planning expenses 9,765 910 Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP measure) $ 74,761 $ 64,563 RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME TO NON-GAAP NET INCOME AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME (NON-GAAP MEASURE) (Unaudited)\nFOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AND 2017 (In thousands,\n2018 2017 Net income $ 29,092 $ 22,391 (Income) loss from discontinued operations, net of tax 148 (9 ) Credit facility amendment expenses (1) 348 2,028 Acquisition, integration and strategic planning expenses 9,765 910 Tax effect on adjustments (2,639 ) (1,146 ) Non-GAAP net income 36,714 24,174 Amortization of intangible assets 7,601 8,464 Income taxes on amortization for financial reporting purposes not deductible for income tax purposes (269 ) (406 ) Adjusted Net Income (non-GAAP measure) (2) $ 44,046 $ 32,232 Per diluted share: Net income $ 0.55 $ 0.42 Adjustments 0.28 0.19 Adjusted Net Income (non-GAAP measure) (2) $ 0.83 $ 0.61 Weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding (diluted) 52,831 53,249 (1) During the first quarter of 2018 we incurred costs of $0.3 million related to the amendment to our credit facility to fund the acquisition of ECS.
