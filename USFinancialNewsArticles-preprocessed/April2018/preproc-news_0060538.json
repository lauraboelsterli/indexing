Foti, Jr., remind investors that they have until June 4, 2018 to file lead plaintiff applications in a securities class action lawsuit against Synacor, Inc. (NasdaqGM: SYNC), if they purchased the Company’s securities between May 4, 2016 and March 15, 2018, inclusive (the “Class Period”). This action is pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.\nWhat You May Do\nIf you purchased securities of Synacor and would like to discuss your legal rights and how this case might affect you and your right to recover for your economic loss, you may, without obligation or cost to you, contact KSF Managing Partner Lewis Kahn toll-free at 1-877-515-1850 or via email ( lewis.kahn@ksfcounsel.com ), or visit https://www.ksfcounsel.com/cases/nasdaqgm-sync/ to learn more.

Foti, Jr., is a law firm focused on securities, antitrust and consumer class actions, along with merger & acquisition and breach of fiduciary litigation against publicly traded companies on behalf of shareholders.
