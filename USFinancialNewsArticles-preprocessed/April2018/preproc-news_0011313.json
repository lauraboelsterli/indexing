    "text": "ANN ARBOR, Mich., April 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Domino's Pizza, Inc. (NYSE: DPZ) , the largest pizza company in the world based on retail sales, today announced that certain of its subsidiaries intend to complete a recapitalization transaction, which will include the refinancing of a portion of their outstanding securitization debt with a new series of securitized debt.\nThe Company's last recapitalization occurred in July 2017 (the \"2017 Recapitalization\"), with the issuance of a $1.9 billion securitized financing facility consisting of $300 million of floating rate notes and $1.6 billion of fixed rate notes and the entry into a new $175 million variable funding note facility (the \"2017 VFN Note Facility\") that replaced the 2015 VFN Notes (defined below). As of December 31, 2017, there was approximately $46.7 million of outstanding letters of credit and $128.3 million of available borrowing capacity under the 2017 VFN Note Facility.\nThe Company's prior recapitalization before the 2017 Recapitalization occurred in October 2015 (the \"2015 Recapitalization\"), with the issuance of a $1.425 billion securitized financing facility consisting of $1.3 billion of fixed rate notes (the \"2015 Notes\") and $125 million of variable funding notes (the \"2015 VFN Notes\").\nThe Company's subsidiaries intend to issue approximately $825 million of new securitized notes (the \"2018 Notes\") and to use the proceeds to prepay and retire approximately $491.3 million of the outstanding 2015 Notes at par, to pay transaction fees and for general corporate purposes.\nThe consummation of the offering is subject to market and other conditions and is anticipated to close in the second quarter of 2018. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete the refinancing transaction on the terms described or at all.\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the 2018 Notes or any other security. The notes to be offered have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933.\nAbout Domino's PizzaÂ®\nFounded in 1960, Domino's Pizza is the largest pizza company in the world based on retail sales, with a significant business in both delivery and carryout pizza. It ranks among the world's top public restaurant brands with a global enterprise of more than 14,800 stores in over 85 markets. Domino's had global retail sales of over $12.2 billion in 2017, with more than $5.9 billion in the U.S. and more than $6.3 billion internationally. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Domino's had global retail sales of nearly $4.0 billion, with nearly $1.9 billion in the U.S. and over $2.1 billion internationally. Its system is comprised of independent franchise owners who accounted for over 97% of Domino's stores as of the fourth quarter of 2017. Emphasis on technology innovation helped Domino's achieve more than half of all global retail sales in 2017 from digital channels, primarily online ordering and mobile applications. In the U.S., Domino's generates over 60% of sales via digital channels and has produced several innovative ordering platforms, including Google Home, Facebook Messenger, Apple Watch, Amazon Echo, Twitter and text message using a pizza emoji. In late 2017, as part of an industry-first collaboration with Ford Motor Company, Domino's began a meaningful test of delivery using self-driving vehicles.\nSAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995:\nThis press release contains various forward-looking statements about the Company within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the \"Act\") that are based on current management expectations that involve substantial risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements.
