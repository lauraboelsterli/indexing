    "text": "April 16, 2018 / 8:30 PM / Updated 15 minutes ago Nike's head of diversity, inclusion steps down Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Nike Inc’s ( NKE.N ) Vice President of Diversity and Inclusion Antoine Andrews has left the company, a spokeswoman said on Monday, the latest in a string of executive departures at the sportswear maker. \nNike’s spokeswoman declined to comment further about Andrews’ departure. \nTrevor Edwards, the president of Nike’s namesake brand, resigned last month, followed by the exit of another vice president, Jayme Martin. \nNike, during Edwards’ exit, had flagged “conduct inconsistent with Nike’s core values and against our code of conduct,” but said there had been no direct allegations of misconduct against Edwards. \nEarlier this month, Nike’s Chief Human Resources Officer Monique Matheson said the company needs to accelerate representation of women and people of colour at leadership levels. \nAndrews joined Nike in 2015, before which he was the global diversity and inclusion director at cyber-security firm Symantec Corp ( SYMC.O ), according to his LinkedIn profile. \nBloomberg reported his departure earlier on Monday.
