    "text": "LONDON, April 14 (Reuters) - Martin Sorrell said on Saturday that he was stepping down as head of the British-based global advertising agency WPP.\nIn a letter to WPP staff, Sorrell said the “current disruption” was “putting too much unnecessary pressure on the business”.\nHe said he had decided that “in your interest, in the interest of our clients, in the interest of all shareowners, both big and small, and in the interest of all our other stakeholders, it is best for me to step aside”.\nReporting by Kate Holton, Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ",
