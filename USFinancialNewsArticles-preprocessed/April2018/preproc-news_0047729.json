    "text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Moderna Therapeutics, a clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines to create a new generation of transformative medicines for patients, today announced that Lori Henderson has joined the company as General Counsel. She will serve on Moderna’s Executive Committee and as Corporate Secretary, reporting to Dr. John Mendlein, President, Corporate and Product Strategy.\n“Lori brings a valuable blend of corporate, life sciences, and technology experience that is important to Moderna as we mature and drive development of programs across our mRNA pipeline, create partnerships with key industry collaborators, and continue to advance our technology platform and core infrastructure. Her regulatory, governance, corporate development, and biopharmaceutical industry experience, as well as her background working with executive leadership and corporate boards, will be a tremendous asset as we continue to evolve our organization moving forward,” said Dr. Mendlein.\nMs. Henderson has nearly 30 years as a corporate attorney in both law firm and general counsel roles guiding global public and private companies. She joins Moderna from Albany Molecular Research (AMRI), a pharmaceutical contract research and manufacturing organization, where she was Senior Vice President, General Counsel, Corporate Secretary, and Head of Business Development. While at AMRI, which was recently acquired by private equity firms, she led all legal and business development functions, and was instrumental in the overall growth of the organization, the acquisition of multiple companies, ongoing regulatory and compliance matters, and engagement with pharmaceutical and licensing partners.\nPrior to AMRI, Ms. Henderson was General Counsel, Corporate Secretary, and Chief Administrative Officer at Rand Worldwide, a technology sales and services organization, and prior to that, General Counsel, Corporate Secretary, and Chief Administrative Officer of Moldflow Corporation (which was sold to Autodesk). Ms. Henderson started her career in the corporate practice of the Boston law firm Goodwin Procter.\n“It is a privilege to join Moderna and its leadership team at such an exciting time in the evolution of the company,” said Henderson. “I look forward to helping build an organization that supports the long-term demands of Moderna’s evolving business, its science and development programs, and efforts to bring mRNA medicines to patients where there is an urgent need for new therapies and vaccines.”\nMs. Henderson received her Juris Doctorate from The George Washington University Law School and received her B.A. from Gordon College.\nAbout Moderna Therapeutics\nModerna pioneers the discovery and development of messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines, an entirely new class of medicines that directs the body’s cells to produce intracellular or secreted proteins that can have a therapeutic or preventive benefit for both patients and healthy individuals. With its breakthrough platform, Moderna is creating mRNA medicines for a wide range of diseases and conditions, in many cases by addressing currently undruggable targets or underserved areas of medical need. Moderna is developing its innovative mRNA medicines for infectious diseases, immuno-oncology, rare diseases, and cardiovascular diseases, through solely controlled programs and collaborations with strategic partners.\nHeadquartered in Cambridge, Mass., privately held Moderna currently has strategic relationships with AstraZeneca, Plc. (AZ), Merck, Inc (MRK) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), as well as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), an agency of the U.S. Department of Defense; the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a division of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS); and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2017, Moderna was ranked a top biopharma industry employer by",
