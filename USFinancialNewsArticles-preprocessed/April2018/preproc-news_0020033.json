    "text": "Check out the companies making headlines after the bell : \nBed Bath & Beyond stock plummeted 14 percent in extended trading after the retail chain released its fourth-quarter earnings report. Earnings and revenues both beat Wall Street estimates and same-store sales did not decrease as much as expected. However, guidance for the upcoming year was weak and sent shares falling.\nShares of Zumiez shot up as much as 7 percent after hours following the release of positive March sales results. Same-store sales for the month were up over 12 percent and net sales were up nearly 15 percent.\nAmerican Water Works shares dropped nearly 2 percent in the extended session. The public utility company announced an agreement to acquire Pivotal Home Solutions on Wednesday afternoon. \nQuinStreet stock skyrocketed as much as 22 percent post-market after the marketing company reported favorable preliminary third-quarter results.",
