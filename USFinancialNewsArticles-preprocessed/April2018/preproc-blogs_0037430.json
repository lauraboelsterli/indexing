All CFO Journal-produced content can be accessed without a subscription. \nThe Federal Reserve building is seen in Washington, D.C., U.S., Jan. 22, 2018. Getty Images Good morning. U.S regulators proposed another step to ease pressure on the country’s banks by allowing them to phase in the impact of a new accounting rule, reports the WSJ’s Michael Rapoport. This comes as big banks — while reporting solid results – still wait for the effects of the lower corporate tax rate to kick in and a major overhaul of post-crisis banking rules is in the works.\nSome banks had been concerned that the new rule — issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in June 2016 — could cut into their regulatory capital. The rule will require banks to book all expected losses from their loans as soon as they are issued, and could compel some banks to significantly boost their loan-loss reserves.\nUnder the proposal approved for public comment by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Friday, banks can take up to three years to phase in the impact of the new rule on their regulatory capital, a relief at a time when loan growth remains below expectations.\nFuture bank performance depends on whether loan growth picks up on the back of lower taxes and stronger corporate investment, writes the WSJ’s Aaron Back. “As much as we’re all eager to see the benefit,” said JPMorgan Chase & Co. CFO Marianne Lake, “we have to recognize that tax reform is still in its early stages.” JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup Inc. on Friday both beat analyst estimates for first quarter earnings. Bank of America Corp. , set to report results on Monday, is also expected to post higher earnings after the tax code changes.\nTHE DAY AHEAD \nU.S. releases data on retail sales. The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday releases data on March retail sales. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect retail sales increased 0.3%.\nNetflix Inc. is among the companies slated to report earnings today. Here’s what to watch. \nTHE WEEK AHEAD \nSupreme Court could extend states’ reach over online sales taxes. Billions of dollars of goods sold each year by independent merchants on Amazon.com Inc. and other online marketplaces would incur state sales taxes for the first time if justices decide to reverse a quarter-century-old precedent in a case before the U.S. Supreme Court this week.\nChina GDP, U.S. retail sales, eurozone confidence. On Tuesday, China releases data on first-quarter domestic product and monthly business activity (release time is Monday evening in the U.S.). Economists expect the Chinese economy to have slowed slightly to 6.7% growth in the first three months, from the 6.8% expansion in the fourth quarter. The same day, the U.S. Federal Reserve releases data on March industrial production. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal forecast industrial production rose 0.4% in March. On Friday, the European Commission releases data on consumer confidence for April, the first indication of whether the recent decline in economic growth is set to persist.\nCORPORATE NEWS \nCamille Hymes, mid-Atlantic regional vice president for Starbucks, addresses reporters and protesters at a Starbucks location in Philadelphia, Pa., April 15, 2018. Getty Images Starbucks apologizes for store arrests. Starbucks Corp. issued an apology following the arrest of two black men at a Starbucks store in Philadelphia, Pa., and said it would launch an investigation into the incident.\nContending with probe, WPP CEO resigns. Before resigning as chief executive of WPP PLC on Saturday, Martin Sorrell faced a choice: risk enduring an investigation into an allegation of personal misconduct, or leave the advertising company he founded three decades ago, say people familiar with the board and Mr. Sorrell. The abrupt exit of its chief executive leaves WPP vulnerable to a break-up, as the network of agencies faces its biggest challenges since the financial crisis, reports Bloomberg. \nShire to sell oncology unit. Shire PLC said Monday that it will sell its oncology unit to France’s Servier SAS for $2.40 billion in cash. Shire Chief Executive Flemming Ornskov said that although the unit has delivered high growth and profitability, it isn’t “core to Shire’s longer-term strategy.”\nGoldman Sachs acquires personal finance app. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. bought personal-finance app Clarity Money in a deal that closed on Friday, acquiring a mobile storefront for its growing consumer bank.\nElliott builds stake in Whitbread. Shares in Whitbread PLC climbed in early trading on Monday after hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. said it has built up a stake of more than 6% in the owner of Costa Coffee and Premier Inn, reports the BBC.\nHow the Xerox CEO kept his job. Xerox Corp.’s board told Chief Executive Jeff Jacobson in November to stop negotiations with Fujifilm Holdings Corp. because it was considering firing him. Instead, the executive raced to strike a complex deal which ultimately resulted in him staying in his role.\nMerck bets on one big cancer drug, this is why. Merck & Co. is making one of the biggest bets on a single drug in the pharmaceutical industry, a move that is risky but that could, if successful, pay off for the company and a broad array of cancer patients.\nAn energy CEO seeks to reshape U.S. gas exports. U.S. companies are scrambling to figure out how to sell more natural gas abroad. Meg Gentle – the chief executive of Houston-based Tellurian Inc. — thinks she has a unique answer, but it is expected to cost $24 billion.\nREGULATION \nChina delays deal reviews over U.S. trade frictions. Chinese regulators are slowing reviews of multibillion-dollar takeover deals being pursued by Qualcomm Inc. and Bain Capital , people familiar with the matter say, as U.S.-China trade tensions escalate. Qualcomm will refile as early as Monday an application with the Chinese government to clear its $44 billion takeover of NXP Semiconductors NV , sources said, giving regulators more time to decide on the deal, reports Reuters.\nGuggenheim Partners’ asset management unit under SEC investigation. U.S. securities regulators have opened an investigation into Guggenheim Partners LLC’s asset-management unit, according to people familiar with the matter.\nDispute over alleged exchange collusion nears trial. Exchange operator CME Group Inc. is facing scrutiny over its political clout and its tactics as a 14-year-old lawsuit nears trial. In the suit at hand, European rival Eurex — now owned by Deutsche Boerse AG — alleged it failed in the U.S. because of collusion between two big Chicago futures exchanges which are now both part of CME Group.\nECONOMY \nThe Rusal logo sits on aluminum ingots at the Irkutsk aluminium smelting plant in Shelekhov, Russia, Sept. 21, 2015. Bloomberg News U.S. sanctions threaten to drive up borrowing costs for Russian companies. U.S. sanctions on certain Russian oligarchs and firms are rippling across the economy, threatening to punish more than a dozen other Russian companies that need to refinance $22.8 billion in international bonds over the next 18 months. One of the affected companies is United Co. Rusal PLC , owned by Oleg Deripaska, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nTrump adviser says U.S. can avoid escalation with China. Lawrence Kudlow, President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser, said Friday he is optimistic the U.S. can avoid a broader trade fight with China and said the White House was close to securing a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico.\nTrump talks TPP, but trade partners demand patience. President Donald Trump is talking again about joining the Pacific Rim trade agreement. But any serious effort to do so would be fraught with difficulty, not least because Mr. Trump is demanding a “substantially better” deal than what Washington got two years ago.\nThe growing pains of a surging population. Idaho is the fastest-growing state in the U.S. But the state and its capital, Boise, are challenged by the byproducts of growth: skyrocketing housing prices, labor shortages and worsening traffic congestion.\nThe Morning Ledger from CFO Journal cues up the most important news in corporate finance every weekday morning.
