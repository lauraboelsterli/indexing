Soccer Football - Champions League Round of 16 Second Leg - FC Barcelona vs Chelsea - Camp Nou, Barcelona, Spain - March 14, 2018 Chelsea's Marcos Alonso looks dejected after the match REUTERS/Albert Gea \nThe 27-year-old was charged for his challenge on Southampton striker Shane Long during Chelsea’s 3-2 Premier League win at St Mary’s Stadium last weekend. \n“Alonso denied the charge and further submitted that if found proven the suspension would be excessive, however, this was rejected following Wednesday’s hearing,” the FA said in a statement. \nSpaniard Alonso, who was named in the PFA’s Team of the Year earlier this week, will miss Chelsea’s league trip to Burnley later on Thursday, the FA Cup semi-final, and a league match against Swansea City later this month.
