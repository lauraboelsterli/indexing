    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is still assessing intelligence about last weekend’s suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Wednesday, striking a cautious tone hours after President Donald Trump threatened missile strikes.\nAsked if he had seen enough evidence to blame Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces for the attack, Mattis said: “We’re still assessing the intelligence — ourselves and our allies. We’re still working on this.” He did not elaborate.\nMattis also restated that the U.S. military stood ready to provide military options, if appropriate, and as determined by Trump.\nReporting by Phil Stewart and Idrees Ali; Editing by Alistair Bell\n ",
