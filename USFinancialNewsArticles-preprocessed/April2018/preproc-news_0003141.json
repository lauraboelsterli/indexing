    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Central 1 Credit Union (Central 1) is pleased to announce the re-election of Rick Hoevenaars, Angela Kaiser, John Kortram and Rob Wellstood to Central 1’s Board of Directors (Board). Each director will serve a three year term commencing at the conclusion of Central 1’s annual general and special meeting on May 3, 2018 (AGM).\nEffective at the conclusion of the AGM, the Board will include the following Directors:\nBob Armstrong Joel Lalonde Elmer Epp Shelley McDade Kerry Hadad Rob Paterson Rick Hoevenaars Jan O’Brien Angela Kaiser Launi Skinner Bill Kiss Rob Wellstood John Kortram\nCentral 1’s Constitution and Rules (Rules) permit the Board to appoint up to two additional directors for terms of up to three years. The terms of the two current directors appointed pursuant to this Rule expire at the close of Central 1’s 2018 AGM. The Board will determine at its upcoming meeting whether to appoint up to two directors on the foregoing basis for terms beginning at the conclusion of the 2018 AGM.\nAll of the directors serve Central 1 as a whole, but directors elected by Class A members are nominated in, and elected from, either the Ontario or British Columbia (B.C.) regions. This year, there were four vacancies to be filled – two in the B.C. Region and two in the Ontario Region. A call for nominations was issued on November 1, 2017 and nominations were open until February 23, 2018.\nUpon the close of nominations, Central 1’s Nominations and Elections Committee reviewed each application to determine eligibility to stand for election as directors and then interviewed candidates to decide whether they should be endorsed as having the competencies, skills and experience sought by the Board. In total, four candidates, including two incumbents, stood for election in the B.C. region, and three candidates, including two incumbents, stood for election in the Ontario region. Voting took place from March 12 to March 29, 2018.\nThe Board will hold its reorganization meeting on May 3, 2018 at which time it will elect its Chairperson and Vice Chairperson, and Board committee members.\n“I would like to thank all of the candidates who ran, and offer my congratulations to all of the candidates who were elected, for their willingness to serve Central 1 and its members.” said Rick Hoevenaars, Board Chair.\nAbout Central 1\nWith offices in Vancouver, Mississauga and Toronto, Central 1 holds on balance sheet approximately $18.1 billion in assets. It provides wholesale financial products, trust services, payment processing solutions and direct banking services to about 300 credit unions and institutional clients from coast to coast. In addition, Central 1 is the primary liquidity manager, payments provider and trade association for its 42 member credit unions in B.C. and 67 Ontario member credit unions. Its members represent a consumer-oriented, full-service retail financial network that collectively serves 3.4 million members and holds more than $126.8 billion in assets.
