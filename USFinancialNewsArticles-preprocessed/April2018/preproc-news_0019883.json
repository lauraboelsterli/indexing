    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Klein Law Firm announces that a class action complaint has been filed on behalf of shareholders of Akorn, Inc. (NASDAQ: AKRX) who purchased shares between March 1, 2017 and February 26, 2018. The action, which was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Illinois, alleges that the Company violated federal securities laws.\nIn particular, the complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that (1) the Company’s failure to comply with FDA data integrity requirements would jeopardize Fresenius’ acquisition of the Company; (2) the Company lacked effective internal controls over financial reporting; and (3) as a result, the Company’s financial statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.\nShareholders have until May 7, 2018 to petition the court for lead plaintiff status. Your ability to share in any recovery does not require that you serve as lead plaintiff. You may choose to be an absent class member.\nIf you suffered a loss during the class period and wish to obtain additional information, please contact Joseph Klein, Esq. by telephone at 212-616-4899 or visit http://www.kleinstocklaw.com/pslra-c/akorn-inc?wire=2 .\nJoseph Klein, Esq. represents investors and participates in securities litigations involving financial fraud throughout the nation.
