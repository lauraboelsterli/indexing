    "text": "MUNICH, Germany and SAN JOSE, Calif., April 04, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cohesity, the leader of hyperconverged secondary storage , today announced it has expanded its management team for Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), and appointed Johannes Kunz as senior director channel sales EMEA, Thomas Boele as senior director systems engineering EMEA, and Claudia Zieschang as head of EMEA field marketing. The company has thus filled three key positions with well-known industry veterans. With this management team, Cohesity wants to increase its market penetration and communicate the benefits of Cohesity’s hyperconverged data platform to even more customers and sales partners. All three come to Cohesity from SimpliVity.\nJohannes Kunz has more than 25 years of experience in sales, marketing, and management, most of them spent in international positions. As senior director channel sales EMEA at Cohesity, he is responsible for indirect sales, the go-to-market strategy, and channel development in EMEA. Before that, he worked as VP channel sales EMEA for SimpliVity and also held various roles in channel sales, marketing, and product marketing at Hitachi Data Systems. Further companies in his career include NetApp, CA, and Cheyenne Software.\nWith over 20 years of experience in technical presales and marketing position, Thomas Boele brings a vast spectrum of expertise to Cohesity. In his new role as senior director systems engineering EMEA, he focuses on the development and expansion of the presales teams and technical customer service in the region. Before joining Cohesity, he held a variety of positions at SimpliVity, most recently that of vice president solutions architecture EMEA. He has also worked at Riverbed, NetApp, Cisco, and 3Com, amongst others.\nIn the past 15 years, Claudia Zieschang has occupied various positions in marketing at leading US companies. As head of EMEA field marketing for Cohesity, she is responsible for strategic brand development and related activities in EMEA – a role she previously held at SimpliVity. Before joining SimpliVity, she was responsible for marketing in North and Central Europe at F5 Networks and also led strategic enterprise marketing at VMware Germany.\n“When I joined Cohesity at the end of 2017, I knew that our hyperconverged platform approach and our native integration into the cloud gave us a unique opportunity to start a revolution in the European IT market. However, we can only achieve our ambitious goals with the right people,” said Klaus Seidl, VP sales EMEA at Cohesity. “I am pleased to welcome three experienced colleagues to the team who, together with me and the rest of the team, will turn the EMEA market for data protection and hyperconverged secondary storage upside down and support our growth objectives in the whole region.”\nAbout Cohesity\nCohesity makes your data work for you by consolidating secondary storage silos onto a hyperconverged, web-scale data platform that spans both private and public clouds.
