    "text": "April 11, 2018 / 8:43 AM / Updated 24 minutes ago Myanmar minister assures Rohingya in Bangladesh repatriation is a priority Clare Baldwin 3 Min Read \nCOX’S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - A Myanmar minister told Rohingya Muslim refugees in Bangladesh on Wednesday their repatriation was a priority, during the first visit by a top Myanmar official to victims of what the United Nations says was “ethnic cleansing” by the Myanmar army. Rohingya people who fled from their towns after the violence in the state of Rakhine, are seen behind a fence on the border line outside Maungdaw, Myanmar March 31, 2018. Picture taken March 31, 2018. REUTERS/Stringer \nSocial Welfare Minister Win Myat Aye, who is leading rehabilitation efforts in Rakhine State, met about 50 newly arrived refugees in the Kutupalong refugee camp in southeast Bangladesh, according to Mohammed Shamsud Douza, the deputy Bangladesh government official in charge of the refugees. \nA Bangladesh foreign ministry official said his country wanted to show the visiting minister the challenges it was facing in hosting the refugees. \nWin Myat Ayat is expected to meet Bangladesh’s foreign minister in Dhaka on Thursday. \nBangladesh wants the refugees to go home as quickly as possible and officials said this week they hoped the minister’s visit would speed up repatriation. \nBut many refugees say they are reluctant to go back to Buddhist-majority Myanmar, fearing persecution. \n“The most important thing is to the start the repatriation process as soon as possible. We can overcome all of the difficulties,” Win Myat Aye said as he left a meeting with Rohingya representatives at the Kutupalong camp. \nWhen asked about whether Rohingya could be granted Myanmar citizenship, which they had been long denied, the minister replied: “We are trying to have that.” \nMyanmar has rejected accusations of ethnic cleansing in its western state of Rakhine, saying its security forces launched a legitimate counter-insurgency operation on Aug. 25 in response to Rohingya militant attacks. \nRefugees arriving over the months since then have reported killings, burnings, looting and rape by members of the Myanmar security forces and Buddhist vigilantes. \nMyanmar has dismissed most such accounts but the army said on Tuesday seven soldiers had been sentenced to 10 years in jail with hard labor for participating in a massacre of 10 Rohingya Muslim men in a village in September. \nThe two countries reached a deal in November to begin repatriation within two months, but it has not begun, with stateless Rohingya, who face restrictions on their movements in Myanmar, still arriving in Bangladesh. \nBangladesh police in camouflage uniforms were stationed along the road to the Kutupalong camp to provide security for the Myanmar minister. \nPlainclothes police patrolled on foot and ordered vehicles away from the camp administrator’s office. \nHuts of bamboo and plastic sheets will provide meager shelter for refugees when the heavy rain and storms hit Cox’s Bazar, the low-lying coastal strip bordering Myanmar where the camps are located, when the monsoon arrives in June.
