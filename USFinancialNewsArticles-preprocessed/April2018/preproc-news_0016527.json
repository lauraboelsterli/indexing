Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the Company failed to employ internal controls to ensure appropriate accounting practices, including, but not limited to, the calculation of certain loss reserves; (ii) the Company's internal controls over financial reporting were materially weak; (iii) the Company's financial statements were inaccurate and misleading, including by understating certain loss reserves; and (iv) that as a result of the foregoing, Atlas Financial's business, operations, and prospects, were false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.\nOn March 1, 2018, post-market, the Company issued a press release entitled \"Atlas Financial Holdings Announces Preliminary 2017 Fourth Quarter and Year End Financial Results,\" announcing a large increase in its reserves.\nOn this news, the Company's share price fell $7.70, or 40.96%, to close at $11.10 per share on March 2, 2018, on unusually heavy trading volume.\nThe Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Paris, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.
