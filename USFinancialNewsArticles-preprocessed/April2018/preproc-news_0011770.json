    "text": "SANTA MONICA, Calif., April 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AdQuick , the easiest way to purchase and measure outdoor advertising, announced today that it has added Brooke Partelow to its executive leadership team as Vice President, Sales.\nBrooke Partelow has joined ad tech startup AdQuick as Vice President, Sales. Partelow has a proven track record in media and tech, with deep experience in the Out-of-Home (OOH) advertising segment. AdQuick hired her to help it capitalize on the strong interest in its solutions from brands and agencies across the U.S.\nPartelow has a proven track record in media and tech, with deep experience in the Out-of-Home (OOH) advertising segment. AdQuick hired her to help it capitalize on the strong interest in its solutions from brands and agencies across the U.S.\nFounded by Instacart veterans, AdQuick was born out of frustrations with traditional outdoor advertising. Finding and booking space is challenging as there hasn’t been one place to go to find inventory. Once buyers find inventory, the process to actually book is slow and tedious, and must be repeated over and over with different media owners. Worse, the campaigns are not typically measurable, leaving advertisers unclear on the impact and value. AdQuick saw an opportunity to give customers a better way to buy, and give media companies better tools to show the value of campaigns.\nAdQuick launched its basic self-service platform for finding and booking space in early 2017, and quickly landed clients of all sizes, from small businesses up to large companies and chains such as Lyft and H&R Block. In late 2017, it added new analytics tools to help clients - for the first time - measure the impact of their outdoor campaigns.\nBrooke Partelow: experienced tech and media sales pro\nWith a strong background in sales, business development and technology, Brooke has founded and developed the sales departments at a number of very successful SaaS companies including SteelHouse, BounceExchange, DataScience and now, AdQuick.\n“Brooke's extraordinary knowledge of the tech and online marketing spaces make her an amazing asset and advocate for her clients and sales teams,” said Matt O’Connor, founder and CEO at AdQuick. “Her mix of experience is perfect for AdQuick, and I think Brooke will have a big impact on our growth.”\n“AdQuick has come along at just the right time in the market,” said Partelow. “Cord cutting, click fraud and fake news have brands wary of traditional TV and social media advertising, and they are looking for alternatives. AdQuick combines the targeted location of OOH with precise measurability – something that has not been available before. I’m excited to help AdQuick expand its reach among brands.”\nTo learn more about AdQuick, visit www.adquick.com .\nAbout AdQuick\nAdQuick is the easiest way to purchase and measure outdoor advertising, and is the first company to allow anyone to complete the full cycle of booking outdoor ads online, from searching available inventory, to vetting locations, approving assets and analyzing results. The company was born out of two frustrations with outdoor advertising: a slow, low-tech buying process and the inability to quantify the impact of campaigns. AdQuick solves both problems – it aggregates the widest variety of inventory nationwide, allows advertisers to book online, and helps close the loop on campaigns with hard metrics on impact and results. Founded by former Instacart executives, the company is based in Los Angeles.
