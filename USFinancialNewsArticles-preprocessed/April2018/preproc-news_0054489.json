As needed, George will continue to provide financial counsel to the company and the Board of Directors.\"\nGeorge joined the MacLean-Fogg Company as CFO in early 1994 when the company consisted of only a handful of operations. George commented, \"I am honored to have been part of the team responsible for growing the company to its current size. The larger scale made more growth and improvement initiatives possibleâ€”expansion for new products and facilities, investment in areas such as ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) and Operational Transformation (OT). Most notably, the growth and profitability enabled MacLean-Fogg to hire great people. These critical points strengthened MacLean-Fogg's competitive advantage in the industries served. I look forward to following the company's progress in the years to come.\"\nAbout George Cook\nGeorge was appointed CFO in 1994.
