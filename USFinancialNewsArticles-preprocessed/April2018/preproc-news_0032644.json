    "text": "April 19, 2018 / 6:48 AM / Updated 13 minutes ago Weir to buy U.S. mining tools maker ESCO for $1.05 billion Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Weir Group Plc, which makes pumps and valves for mining and energy industries, said it would buy ESCO Corp, a U.S.-based maker of equipment parts, for an equity value of $1.05 billion (Â£739.4 million) as it looks to bolster its mining business. \nEquipment makers like Weir have benefited from higher commodity prices as mining companies boost spending and also look to explore brownfield projects. \nWeir also said it would start a process to sell its flow- control division, which designs and manufactures process pumps and valves for power, oil and gas industries. \nThe flow-control business contributed $365 million pounds in revenue, or about 15.5 percent of its total revenue, last year. \nWeir shares rose as much as 6.5 percent to 2,255 pence in morning trade in London. \nWeir said Portland, Oregon-based ESCO, with an enterprise value of $1.29 billion, makes parts for surface mining and construction industries, including ground engaging tools to move earth. \nESCO shareholders will receive 59 percent of the deal value in cash and the remaining in new Weir shares. \nWeir plans to place about 16.7 million shares, or about 7.4 percent of its share capital, to partly fund the deal. \nThe deal is expected to add to earnings per share in the first full year post completion, expected in early third quarter, Weir said. \nWeir said its first-quarter orders rose 22 percent, with orders in its mining business increasing more than 13 percent. Oil and gas orders rose more than 50 percent, helped by higher demand for pressure pumps in North America. \nWeir maintained its full-year growth outlook for revenue and profit, on a constant currency basis.
