(“Salisbury”), (NASDAQ:SAL), the holding company for Salisbury Bank and Trust Company (the “Bank”), announced results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nNet income available to common shareholders was $2.0 million, or $0.72 per common share, for Salisbury’s first quarter ended March 31, 2018 (first quarter 2018), compared with $1.1 million, or $0.39 per common share, for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 (fourth quarter 2017), and $1.6 million, or $0.58 per common share, for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017 (first quarter 2017).\nSalisbury’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Richard J. Cantele, Jr., stated, “We posted strong results for the quarter, which included solid loan growth and continued improvements in credit quality. During the quarter we also relocated our Newburgh branch to an improved location that will allow us to better serve our existing and new clients. Additionally, in April 2018, we completed the acquisition of the Fishkill, New York branch of Orange Bank & Trust Company and we consolidated our existing Fishkill branch into this new location. We continue to remain focused on enhancing shareholder value and providing outstanding service to our customers.”\nNet Interest Income\nTax equivalent net interest income for the first quarter 2018 decreased $119 thousand, or 1.4%, versus fourth quarter 2017, and increased $19 thousand, or 0.2%, versus first quarter 2017. Average earning assets increased $20.6 million versus fourth quarter 2017, and increased $59.6 million versus first quarter 2017. Average total interest bearing deposits increased $1.7 million versus fourth quarter 2017 and increased $37.0 million versus first quarter 2017. The increase in average interest bearing deposits from the prior year first quarter reflected the acquisition of the New Paltz branch in June 2017, which increased deposits by approximately $31 million. The tax equivalent net interest margin for the first quarter 2018 was 3.51% compared with 3.58% for the fourth quarter 2017 and 3.69% for the first quarter 2017.\nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income for first quarter 2018 decreased $207 thousand versus fourth quarter 2017 and decreased $49 thousand versus first quarter 2017. The fourth quarter 2017 included gains of $193 thousand on the sale of available-for-sale securities compared with losses of $15 thousand in the first quarter 2018.\nTrust and Wealth Advisory revenues increased $37 thousand versus fourth quarter 2017 and increased $40 thousand versus first quarter 2017. The increases primarily reflected higher asset management fees.\nService charges and fees decreased $51 thousand versus fourth quarter 2017, and decreased $94 thousand versus first quarter 2017. The declines from both comparative periods primarily reflected lower ATM, deposit and loan related fees.\nIncome from mortgage sales and servicing increased $5 thousand versus fourth quarter 2017 and increased $7 thousand versus first quarter 2017. The increase from the fourth quarter 2017 primarily reflected lower amortization expense on mortgage servicing rights. The increase from the first quarter 2017 reflected lower amortization expense on mortgage servicing rights which was mostly offset by lower gains on the sale of mortgages, due to a reduction in volume, and lower mortgage servicing income.\nNon-Interest Expense\nNon-interest expense for the first quarter 2018 included OREO charges of $52 thousand compared with $1.4 million in the fourth quarter 2017 and $144 thousand in the first quarter 2017. Excluding OREO charges, non-interest expense for first quarter 2018 increased $433 thousand versus fourth quarter 2017 and decreased $32 thousand versus first quarter 2017. Compensation expense increased $292 thousand versus fourth quarter 2017, and increased $148 thousand versus first quarter 2017. The increase from the fourth quarter 2017 primarily reflected higher benefits expense and payroll taxes partly offset by lower salary expense. The increase from the first quarter 2017 reflected higher salary, benefits and payroll tax expenses.\nPremises and equipment costs decreased $10 thousand versus fourth quarter 2017 and increased $129 thousand versus first quarter 2017. The decrease from the fourth quarter 2017 reflected lower software and depreciation expense, partly offset by higher real estate taxes. The increase from the first quarter 2017 reflected higher lease expense, resulting from the acquisition of the New Paltz branch, higher software maintenance expense, and higher real estate taxes. Data processing expenses, which also include data communications related expenses, decreased $50 thousand versus fourth quarter 2017 and increased $14 thousand versus first quarter 2017. The decrease from the fourth quarter 2017 reflected lower Trust department data processing expenses and lower ATM and debit card network expenses.\nProfessional fees increased $82 thousand versus fourth quarter 2017 and decreased $98 thousand versus first quarter 2017. The increase from the fourth quarter 2017 was attributed to higher consultation, investment management and legal fees, which were partly offset by a reduction in internal audit expense. The decrease from the prior year first quarter primarily reflected lower internal audit and legal expenses partly offset by higher external audit and exam expenses.\nLoan related expenses increased $133 thousand versus the fourth quarter 2017 and decreased $75 thousand compared with the first quarter 2017. The fourth quarter 2017 included a reversal of accruals for OREO carrying costs and the delinquent real estate taxes on OREO properties. The decrease from the first quarter 2017 reflected lower OREO carrying costs.\nThe effective income tax rates for first quarter 2018, fourth quarter 2017 and first quarter 2017 were 18.1%, 48.4% and 27.0%, respectively. The lower tax rate for first quarter 2018 reflected the reduction in the federal statutory rate from 34% to 21% as a result of the Federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017. Excluding the discrete charge in the fourth quarter 2017 related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets as a result of this tax law change, the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 27.12%.\nLoans\nNet loans receivable increased $66 million, or 9% from $765 million as of the first quarter 2017 to $830 million at March 31, 2018, and increased $29 million, or 4% from $802 million at December 31, 2017.\nAsset Quality\nNon-performing assets decreased $1.6 million during the first quarter 2018 to $5.8 million, or 0.57% of assets at March 31, 2018, from $7.4 million, or 0.74% of assets at December 31, 2017, and decreased $5.1 million from $10.9 million, or 1.16% of assets, at March 31, 2017. The decrease in non-performing assets from the fourth quarter of 2017 reflected the payoff of certain non-performing loans.\nThe amount of total impaired and potential problem loans were $23.0 million or 2.75% of gross loans receivable at March 31, 2018 compared to $23.9 million, or 2.97% of gross loans receivable at December 31, 2017 and $21.5 million, or 2.79% of gross loans receivable at March 31, 2017.\nAccruing loans receivable 30-to-89 days past due were $3.4 million or 0.40% of gross loans receivable at March 31, 2018 compared to $3.5 million, or 0.44% of gross loans receivable at December 31 2017, and $11.9 million, or 1.55% of gross loans receivable at March 31, 2017.\nSalisbury endeavors to work constructively to resolve its non-performing loan issues with customers. Substantially all non-performing loans are collateralized with real estate and the repayment of such loans is largely dependent on the return of such loans to performing status or the liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral.\nThe provision for loan loss expense was $326 thousand for first quarter 2018 compared with $67 thousand for fourth quarter 2017 and $352 thousand for the first quarter 2017. The increase from the prior year fourth quarter primarily reflected higher recoveries received in the fourth quarter of 2017, which reduced the need for additional provision expense in that quarter. Net loan charge-offs (recoveries) were $43 thousand for the first quarter 2018, $(214) thousand for fourth quarter 2017 and $194 thousand for the first quarter 2017. Reserve coverage, as measured by the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to gross loans, was 0.84% for the first quarter 2018, versus 0.84% for the fourth quarter 2017 and 0.82% for the first quarter 2017. Similarly, reserve coverage, as measured by the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans was 139% for the first quarter of 2018, versus 102% for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 89% for the first quarter of 2017.\nCapital\nShareholders’ equity was $98.1 million at March 31, 2018 and book value and tangible book value were $35.20 and $29.63, respectively. Tangible book value excludes goodwill and core deposit intangibles.\nThe regulatory capital ratios of the Company and the Bank remain in compliance with regulatory “well capitalized” requirements. At March 31, 2018, Salisbury’s tier 1 leverage, total risk-based capital, and common equity tier 1 capital ratios were 8.56%, 12.70%, and 10.54%, respectively. The Bank’s tier 1 leverage, total risk-based capital, and common equity tier 1 capital ratios were 9.27%, 12.32%, and 11.42%, respectively, compared with regulatory “well capitalized” minimums of 5.00%, 10.00%, and 6.5%, respectively.\nDividends on Common Shares\nThe Board of Directors of Salisbury declared a $0.28 per common share quarterly cash dividend at their April 27, 2018 meeting. Such dividend will be paid on May 25, 2018 to shareholders of record as of May 11, 2018.\nBackground\nSalisbury Bancorp, Inc. is the parent company of Salisbury Bank and Trust Company (the “Bank”), a Connecticut chartered commercial bank serving the communities of northwestern Connecticut and proximate communities in New York and Massachusetts, since 1848, through full service branches in Canaan, Lakeville, Salisbury and Sharon, Connecticut; Great Barrington, South Egremont and Sheffield, Massachusetts; and Dover Plains, Fishkill, Millerton, Newburgh, New Paltz, Poughkeepsie, and Red Oaks Mill, New York.
