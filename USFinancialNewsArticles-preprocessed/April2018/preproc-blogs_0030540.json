Photo: LUIS ACOSTA/AFP/Getty Images \nAn Aruban official living in Florida pleaded guilty Friday to money-laundering charges connected with his role in an a scheme to take bribes to influence telecommunications contracts, prosecutors said.\nEgbert Yvan Ferdinand Koolman, who lived in Miami, was the product manager of the government-owned Servicio di Telecommunicacion di Aruba NV, or Setar. Mr. Koolman admitted that he received $1.3 million in bribes over the course of a decade in exchange for using his position to award mobile-phone and accessory contracts, the U.S. Justice Department said.\nHe received the money via wire transfers from U.S.-based banks, in cash during meetings in Miami and Aruba and by withdrawing funds in Aruba using a bank card that drew money from a U.S. account. Mr. Koolman pleaded guilty in Florida federal court to a count of money-laundering conspiracy.\nHe is scheduled to be sentenced on June 27. An attorney for Mr. Koolman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nA second man, Lawrence Parker Jr., of Miami, pleaded guilty in late December to Foreign Corrupt Practices Act conspiracy charges in connection with the scheme, prosecutors said Friday. The FCPA bars the use of bribes to foreign officials to get or keep business.\nMr. Parker admitted in court documents in his case that he conspired to pay more than $700,000 in bribes, directly and indirectly, to an official at Setar identified at the time as “Foreign Official A.”\nMr. Parker is scheduled to be sentenced April 30.Prosecutors on Thursday filed a request to reduce his prison sentence due to his cooperation in the case. An attorney for Mr. Parker didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nWrite to Samuel Rubenfeld at Samuel.Rubenfeld@wsj.com.
