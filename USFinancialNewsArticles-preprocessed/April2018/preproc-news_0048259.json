    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nevada Copper Corp. (TSX:NCU) (\"Nevada Copper\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce the appointment of Matthew Gili as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company effective May 1, 2018. Mr Gili comes directly from Barrick, where he served as Executive General Manager for the Cortez District in Nevada and, more recently, as Chief Technical Officer and Senior Vice President, Operations Projects.\nStephen Gill, Non-Executive Chairman of Nevada Copper, stated “ I am excited to welcome Matthew Gili to Nevada Copper. He brings an exceptional track record of success - delivering some of the world’s largest and most complex underground and open pit mines. I am confident that, with his leadership, the Company will be well positioned to become the next copper producer in North America with its underground mine, and realizing the full potential of its large, fully-permitted, open pit project and strategic land holding in Nevada. Following the recent addition of Tom Albanese and Ernie Nutter to Nevada Copper, Matt’s appointment is a key step as we continue to build out a highly-experienced team focused on execution .”\nMr. Gili has over 20 years of experience in the mining industry, having served in a variety of senior executive roles at Barrick and Rio Tinto. During his 15-year career with Rio Tinto, his appointments included Chief Operating Officer and Vice President of Resource Strategy for the Oyu Tolgoi project in Mongolia, Managing Director of Palabora Mining Company in South Africa, and Mine Manager at Greens Creek, Alaska. Prior to joining Nevada Copper, he was with Barrick for the last five years.\nMr. Gili holds a Bachelor’s degree in Mining Engineering from University of Idaho and an Idaho professional engineer certification.\nAbout Nevada Copper\nNevada Copper is a copper company with significant production potential from its large land position in Nevada, United States. Nevada Copper is well placed to be the next North American copper producer, due to the advanced stage of its Pumpkin Hollow mine.\nIts two fully-permitted projects include: the high-grade Pumpkin Hollow underground mine which is expected to move into construction shortly with a view to near-term commencement of copper production; and the Pumpkin Hollow open pit, a large-scale copper deposit which is currently undergoing an optimization program to target a reduced-capex, staged-development approach.\nMore information about the Underground Project is available in the Pre-Feasibility Study (the “Technical Report”) as filed on SEDAR on January 9, 2018, and prepared in accordance with NI 43-101.\nNEVADA COPPER CORP.\nAbraham Jonker, Interim CEO\nRobert McKnight, CFO\nWe seek safe harbour.\nFor further information call:\nRich Matthews, Marketing and Investor Relations\nPhone: 604-683-8992\nEmail: info@nevadacopper.com\nSource: Nevada Copper Corp.",
