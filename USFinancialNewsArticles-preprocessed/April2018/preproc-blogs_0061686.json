Follow us on Twitter at @WSJRisk.\nU.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, shown in March, unveiled the FCPA Corporate Enforcement Policy in November. Reuters Good morning. Dun & Bradstreet is the first company to avoid criminal charges under a months-old U.S. Justice Department policy meant to encourage companies to turn in themselves for bribery. The firm will pay $9.2 million to securities regulators.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission found two indirect Dun & Bradstreet subsidiaries in China made unlawful payments to win or keep business from 2006 through 2012. It said the illegal payments weren’t properly recorded in the company’s books and the company’s accounting controls were too weak to detect the problem.\n“Based upon the information known to the Department at this time, we have declined prosecution consistent with the FCPA Corporate Enforcement Policy,” the DOJ said in a letter Monday to a lawyer for the business-data company. “We have reached this conclusion despite the bribery committed by company’s subsidiaries in China.”\nThe policy announced in late November by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein builds on a pilot program that began in early 2016. It includes a “presumption” prosecutors won’t act against companies that voluntarily disclose their wrongdoing, cooperate with investigators and take the steps needed to prevent a recurrence. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act bars companies from bribing foreign officials to win or keep a business advantage.\nThe Justice Department in its letter noted Dun & Bradstreet voluntarily disclosed the matter, cooperated with the investigation and worked to improve its compliance program and accounting systems.\nDun & Bradstreet terminated 11 people involved in the misconduct, disciplined others and will pay the SEC “the full amount of disgorgement” determined by the securities regulator. The SEC said the company will pay $6.1 million of profit gained via its misconduct, interest of $1.1 million and a penalty of $2 million, bringing the total to $9.2 million.\nDun & Bradstreet didn’t admit or deny wrongdoing. The company confirmed it resolved matters with the SEC and said it takes seriously its obligation to run its business legally and responsibly.\nCOMPLIANCE\nU.S. curbs human-rights cases vs. companies. The Supreme Court limited foreign victims of terrorism, torture and other international crimes in their use of U.S. courts to sue corporations they say helped perpetrate abuses, ruling that a centuries-old statute at the heart of major human-rights cases could be employed only against individuals, the WSJ reports.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 to limit the use of the Alien Torts Statute against corporations.

A third federal judge ruled against efforts to cancel Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which protects undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. The ruling requires the U.S. to accept new applications under the program, but gives the Trump administration 90 days to explain its decision to close DACA, the WSJ reports.\nU.S. FDA goes after e-cigarette maker.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is pushing for improved cybersecurity for medical devices that can be vulnerable to attack. The FDA plans to set up a “go-team” to investigate suspected incidents of compromise in a field where such lapses can have potentially deadly consequences, the WSJ reports.\nGOVERNANCE\nEurope’s mandates give women board seats. Diversity advocates have long argued in business terms for women in high-ranking roles. Now blunt-force measures appear to be moving the needle. The U.S., once the leader in female directors, is lagging Europe where mandates have forced corporations to boost the ratio of women holding board seats, the WSJ reports.\nRISK\nPyongyang’s nuclear test site is badly damaged. Much of North Korea’s underground nuclear test facility is unusable due to the collapse of a cavity inside the mountain after the latest detonation, according to a soon-to-be-published study. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said Saturday he is closing the facility, a move welcomed by the U.S., South Korea and China, the WSJ reports.\nU.S. EPA proposes shift on rules. The Environmental Protection Agency plans to restrict research used in developing regulations, a change that could affect rules governing everything from household products to power-plant emissions.
