HASHMAP: depend on the case, the worst one can be O(n)
- Time it takes to search for 100k terms using the hashmap: 562.5 ms = 0.56 s
- Time it takes to search for 500k terms using the hashmap: Took 3548174000 ns OR 3548.174 ms
- Time it takes to search for 1M terms using the hashmap: Function search_time took 8031250000 ns OR 8031.25 ms
